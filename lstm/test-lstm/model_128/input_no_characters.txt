my readers have opportunities of judging for themselves whether the
influences and tendencies which i distrusted in america had at that
time any existence but in my imagination  they can examine for
themselves whether there has been anything in the public career of that
country since at home or abroad which suggests that those influences
and tendencies really did exist  as they find the fact they will judge
me  if they discern any evidences of wrong-going in any direction that
i have indicated they will acknowledge that i had reason in what i
wrote  if they discern no such indications they will consider me
altogether mistaken—but not wilfully

prejudiced i am not and never have been otherwise than in favour of
the united states  i have many friends in america i feel a grateful
interest in the country i hope and believe it will successfully work out
a problem of the highest importance to the whole human race  to
represent me as viewing america with ill-nature coldness or animosity
is merely to do a very foolish thing which is always a very easy one

chapter i
going away

i shall never forget the one-fourth serious and three-fourths comical
astonishment with which on the morning of the third of january
eighteen-hundred-and-forty-two i opened the door of and put my head
into a  state-room on board the britannia steam-packet twelve hundred
tons burthen per register bound for halifax and boston and carrying her
majestys mails

that this state-room had been specially engaged for  charles dickens
esquire and lady was rendered sufficiently clear even to my scared
intellect by a very small manuscript announcing the fact which was
pinned on a very flat quilt covering a very thin mattress spread like a
surgical plaster on a most inaccessible shelf  but that this was the
state-room concerning which charles dickens esquire and lady had held
daily and nightly conferences for at least four months preceding that
this could by any possibility be that small snug chamber of the
imagination which charles dickens esquire with the spirit of prophecy
strong upon him had always foretold would contain at least one little
sofa and which his lady with a modest yet most magnificent sense of its
limited dimensions had from the first opined would not hold more than
two enormous portmanteaus in some odd corner out of sight (portmanteaus
which could now no more be got in at the door not to say stowed away
than a giraffe could be persuaded or forced into a flower-pot) that this
utterly impracticable thoroughly hopeless and profoundly preposterous
box had the remotest reference to or connection with those chaste and
pretty not to say gorgeous little bowers sketched by a masterly hand
in the highly varnished lithographic plan hanging up in the agents
counting-house in the city of london that this room of state in short
could be anything but a pleasant fiction and cheerful jest of the
captains invented and put in practice for the better relish and
enjoyment of the real state-room presently to be disclosed—these were
truths which i really could not for the moment bring my mind at all to
bear upon or comprehend  and i sat down upon a kind of horsehair slab
or perch of which there were two within and looked without any
expression of countenance whatever at some friends who had come on board
with us and who were crushing their faces into all manner of shapes by
endeavouring to squeeze them through the small doorway

we had experienced a pretty smart shock before coming below which but
that we were the most sanguine people living might have prepared us for
the worst  the imaginative artist to whom i have already made allusion
has depicted in the same great work a chamber of almost interminable
perspective furnished as mr robins would say in a style of more than
eastern splendour and filled (but not inconveniently so) with groups of
ladies and gentlemen in the very highest state of enjoyment and
vivacity  before descending into the bowels of the ship we had passed
from the deck into a long narrow apartment not unlike a gigantic hearse
with windows in the sides having at the upper end a melancholy stove at
which three or four chilly stewards were warming their hands while on
either side extending down its whole dreary length was a long long
table over each of which a rack fixed to the low roof and stuck full
of drinking-glasses and cruet-stands hinted dismally at rolling seas and
heavy weather  i had not at that time seen the ideal presentment of this
chamber which has since gratified me so much but i observed that one of
our friends who had made the arrangements for our voyage turned pale on
entering retreated on the friend behind him smote his forehead
involuntarily and said below his breath  impossible it cannot be or
words to that effect  he recovered himself however by a great effort
and after a preparatory cough or two cried with a ghastly smile which
is still before me looking at the same time round the walls  ha the
breakfast-room steward—eh?  we all foresaw what the answer must be we
knew the agony he suffered  he had often spoken of the saloon had
taken in and lived upon the pictorial idea had usually given us to
understand at home that to form a just conception of it it would be
necessary to multiply the size and furniture of an ordinary drawing-room
by seven and then fall short of the reality  when the man in reply
avowed the truth the blunt remorseless naked truth  this is the
saloon sir—he actually reeled beneath the blow

in persons who were so soon to part and interpose between their else
daily communication the formidable barrier of many thousand miles of
stormy space and who were for that reason anxious to cast no other
cloud not even the passing shadow of a moments disappointment or
discomfiture upon the short interval of happy companionship that yet
remained to them—in persons so situated the natural transition from
these first surprises was obviously into peals of hearty laughter and i
can report that i for one being still seated upon the slab or perch
before mentioned roared outright until the vessel rang again  thus in
less than two minutes after coming upon it for the first time we all by
common consent agreed that this state-room was the pleasantest and most
facetious and capital contrivance possible and that to have had it one
inch larger would have been quite a disagreeable and deplorable state of
things  and with this and with showing how—by very nearly closing the
door and twining in and out like serpents and by counting the little
washing slab as standing-room—we could manage to insinuate four people
into it all at one time and entreating each other to observe how very
airy it was (in dock) and how there was a beautiful port-hole which
could be kept open all day (weather permitting) and how there was quite
a large bulls-eye just over the looking-glass which would render shaving
a perfectly easy and delightful process (when the ship didnt roll too
much) we arrived at last at the unanimous conclusion that it was
rather spacious than otherwise though i do verily believe that
deducting the two berths one above the other than which nothing smaller
for sleeping in was ever made except coffins it was no bigger than one
of those hackney cabriolets which have the door behind and shoot their
fares out like sacks of coals upon the pavement

having settled this point to the perfect satisfaction of all parties
concerned and unconcerned we sat down round the fire in the ladies
cabin—just to try the effect  it was rather dark certainly but
somebody said  of course it would be light at sea a proposition to
which we all assented echoing  of course of course though it would be
exceedingly difficult to say why we thought so  i remember too when we
had discovered and exhausted another topic of consolation in the
circumstance of this ladies cabin adjoining our state-room and the
consequently immense feasibility of sitting there at all times and
seasons and had fallen into a momentary silence leaning our faces on
our hands and looking at the fire one of our party said with the solemn
air of a man who had made a discovery  what a relish mulled claret will
have down here which appeared to strike us all most forcibly as though
there were something spicy and high-flavoured in cabins which
essentially improved that composition and rendered it quite incapable of
perfection anywhere else

there was a stewardess too actively engaged in producing clean sheets
and table-cloths from the very entrails of the sofas and from unexpected
lockers of such artful mechanism that it made ones head ache to see
them opened one after another and rendered it quite a distracting
circumstance to follow her proceedings and to find that every nook and
corner and individual piece of furniture was something else besides what
it pretended to be and was a mere trap and deception and place of secret
stowage whose ostensible purpose was its least useful one

god bless that stewardess for her piously fraudulent account of january
voyages  god bless her for her clear recollection of the companion
passage of last year when nobody was ill and everybody dancing from
morning to night and it was  a run of twelve days and a piece of the
purest frolic and delight and jollity  all happiness be with her for
her bright face and her pleasant scotch tongue which had sounds of old
home in it for my fellow-traveller and for her predictions of fair winds
and fine weather (all wrong or i shouldnt be half so fond of her) and
for the ten thousand small fragments of genuine womanly tact by which
without piecing them elaborately together and patching them up into
shape and form and case and pointed application she nevertheless did
plainly show that all young mothers on one side of the atlantic were near
and close at hand to their little children left upon the other and that
what seemed to the uninitiated a serious journey was to those who were
in the secret a mere frolic to be sung about and whistled at  light be
her heart and gay her merry eyes for years

the state-room had grown pretty fast but by this time it had expanded
into something quite bulky and almost boasted a bay-window to view the
sea from  so we went upon deck again in high spirits and there
everything was in such a state of bustle and active preparation that the
blood quickened its pace and whirled through ones veins on that clear
frosty morning with involuntary mirthfulness  for every gallant ship was
riding slowly up and down and every little boat was splashing noisily in
the water and knots of people stood upon the wharf gazing with a kind
of  dread delight on the far-famed fast american steamer and one party
of men were  taking in the milk or in other words getting the cow on
board and another were filling the icehouses to the very throat with
fresh provisions with butchers-meat and garden-stuff pale
sucking-pigs calves heads in scores beef veal and pork and poultry
out of all proportion and others were coiling ropes and busy with oakum
yarns and others were lowering heavy packages into the hold and the
pursers head was barely visible as it loomed in a state of exquisite
perplexity from the midst of a vast pile of passengers luggage and
there seemed to be nothing going on anywhere or uppermost in the mind of
anybody but preparations for this mighty voyage  this with the bright
cold sun the bracing air the crisply-curling water the thin white
crust of morning ice upon the decks which crackled with a sharp and
cheerful sound beneath the lightest tread was irresistible  and when
again upon the shore we turned and saw from the vessels mast her name
signalled in flags of joyous colours and fluttering by their side the
beautiful american banner with its stars and stripes—the long three
thousand miles and more and longer still the six whole months of
absence so dwindled and faded that the ship had gone out and come home
again and it was broad spring already in the coburg dock at liverpool

i have not inquired among my medical acquaintance whether turtle and
cold punch with hock champagne and claret and all the slight et
cetera usually included in an unlimited order for a good
dinner—especially when it is left to the liberal construction of my
faultless friend mr radley of the adelphi hotel—are peculiarly
calculated to suffer a sea-change or whether a plain mutton-chop and a
glass or two of sherry would be less likely of conversion into foreign
and disconcerting material  my own opinion is that whether one is
discreet or indiscreet in these particulars on the eve of a sea-voyage
is a matter of little consequence and that to use a common phrase  it
comes to very much the same thing in the end   be this as it may i
know that the dinner of that day was undeniably perfect that it
comprehended all these items and a great many more and that we all did
ample justice to it  and i know too that bating a certain tacit
avoidance of any allusion to to-morrow such as may be supposed to
prevail between delicate-minded turnkeys and a sensitive prisoner who is
to be hanged next morning we got on very well and all things
considered were merry enough

when the morning—the morning—came and we met at breakfast it was
curious to see how eager we all were to prevent a moments pause in the
conversation and how astoundingly gay everybody was the forced spirits
of each member of the little party having as much likeness to his natural
mirth as hot-house peas at five guineas the quart resemble in flavour
the growth of the dews and air and rain of heaven  but as one oclock
the hour for going aboard drew near this volubility dwindled away by
little and little despite the most persevering efforts to the contrary
until at last the matter being now quite desperate we threw off all
disguise openly speculated upon where we should be this time to-morrow
this time next day and so forth and entrusted a vast number of messages
to those who intended returning to town that night which were to be
delivered at home and elsewhere without fail within the very shortest
possible space of time after the arrival of the railway train at euston
square  and commissions and remembrances do so crowd upon one at such a
time that we were still busied with this employment when we found
ourselves fused as it were into a dense conglomeration of passengers
and passengers friends and passengers luggage all jumbled together on
the deck of a small steamboat and panting and snorting off to the
packet which had worked out of dock yesterday afternoon and was now
lying at her moorings in the river

and there she is all eyes are turned to where she lies dimly
discernible through the gathering fog of the early winter afternoon
every finger is pointed in the same direction and murmurs of interest
and admiration—as  how beautiful she looks  how trim she is—are heard
on every side  even the lazy gentleman with his hat on one side and his
hands in his pockets who has dispensed so much consolation by inquiring
with a yawn of another gentleman whether he is  going across—as if it
were a ferry—even he condescends to look that way and nod his head as
who should say  no mistake about that and not even the sage lord
burleigh in his nod included half so much as this lazy gentleman of
might who has made the passage (as everybody on board has found out
already its impossible to say how) thirteen times without a single
accident  there is another passenger very much wrapped-up who has been
frowned down by the rest and morally trampled upon and crushed for
presuming to inquire with a timid interest how long it is since the poor
president went down  he is standing close to the lazy gentleman and
says with a faint smile that he believes she is a very strong ship to
which the lazy gentleman looking first in his questioners eye and then
very hard in the winds answers unexpectedly and ominously that she
need be  upon this the lazy gentleman instantly falls very low in the
popular estimation and the passengers with looks of defiance whisper
to each other that he is an ass and an impostor and clearly dont know
anything at all about it

but we are made fast alongside the packet whose huge red funnel is
smoking bravely giving rich promise of serious intentions
packing-cases portmanteaus carpet-bags and boxes are already passed
from hand to hand and hauled on board with breathless rapidity  the
officers smartly dressed are at the gangway handing the passengers up
the side and hurrying the men  in five minutes time the little
steamer is utterly deserted and the packet is beset and over-run by its
late freight who instantly pervade the whole ship and are to be met
with by the dozen in every nook and corner swarming down below with
their own baggage and stumbling over other peoples disposing
themselves comfortably in wrong cabins and creating a most horrible
confusion by having to turn out again madly bent upon opening locked
doors and on forcing a passage into all kinds of out-of-the-way places
where there is no thoroughfare sending wild stewards with elfin hair
to and fro upon the breezy decks on unintelligible errands impossible of
execution and in short creating the most extraordinary and bewildering
tumult  in the midst of all this the lazy gentleman who seems to have
no luggage of any kind—not so much as a friend even—lounges up and down
the hurricane deck coolly puffing a cigar and as this unconcerned
demeanour again exalts him in the opinion of those who have leisure to
observe his proceedings every time he looks up at the masts or down at
the decks or over the side they look there too as wondering whether he
sees anything wrong anywhere and hoping that in case he should he will
have the goodness to mention it

what have we here?  the captains boat and yonder the captain himself
now by all our hopes and wishes the very man he ought to be  a
well-made tight-built dapper little fellow with a ruddy face which is
a letter of invitation to shake him by both hands at once and with a
clear blue honest eye that it does one good to see ones sparkling
image in   ring the bell   ding ding ding the very bell is in a
hurry   now for the shore—whos for the shore?— these gentlemen i am
sorry to say   they are away and never said good bye  ah now they
wave it from the little boat   good bye good bye  three cheers from
them three more from us three more from them and they are gone

to and fro to and fro to and fro again a hundred times  this waiting
for the latest mail-bags is worse than all  if we could have gone off in
the midst of that last burst we should have started triumphantly but to
lie here two hours and more in the damp fog neither staying at home nor
going abroad is letting one gradually down into the very depths of
dulness and low spirits  a speck in the mist at last  thats
something  it is the boat we wait for  thats more to the purpose  the
captain appears on the paddle-box with his speaking trumpet the officers
take their stations all hands are on the alert the flagging hopes of
the passengers revive the cooks pause in their savoury work and look
out with faces full of interest  the boat comes alongside the bags are
dragged in anyhow and flung down for the moment anywhere  three cheers
more and as the first one rings upon our ears the vessel throbs like a
strong giant that has just received the breath of life the two great
wheels turn fiercely round for the first time and the noble ship with
wind and tide astern breaks proudly through the lashed and roaming
water




chapter ii
the passage out


we all dined together that day and a rather formidable party we were no
fewer than eighty-six strong  the vessel being pretty deep in the water
with all her coals on board and so many passengers and the weather being
calm and quiet there was but little motion so that before the dinner
was half over even those passengers who were most distrustful of
themselves plucked up amazingly and those who in the morning had
returned to the universal question  are you a good sailor? a very
decided negative now either parried the inquiry with the evasive reply
 oh i suppose im no worse than anybody else or reckless of all moral
obligations answered boldly  yes and with some irritation too as
though they would add  i should like to know what you see in me sir
particularly to justify suspicion

notwithstanding this high tone of courage and confidence i could not but
observe that very few remained long over their wine and that everybody
had an unusual love of the open air and that the favourite and most
coveted seats were invariably those nearest to the door  the tea-table
too was by no means as well attended as the dinner-table and there was
less whist-playing than might have been expected  still with the
exception of one lady who had retired with some precipitation at
dinner-time immediately after being assisted to the finest cut of a very
yellow boiled leg of mutton with very green capers there were no
invalids as yet and walking and smoking and drinking of
brandy-and-water (but always in the open air) went on with unabated
spirit until eleven oclock or thereabouts when  turning in—no sailor
of seven hours experience talks of going to bed—became the order of the
night  the perpetual tramp of boot-heels on the decks gave place to a
heavy silence and the whole human freight was stowed away below
excepting a very few stragglers like myself who were probably like me
afraid to go there

to one unaccustomed to such scenes this is a very striking time on
shipboard  afterwards and when its novelty had long worn off it never
ceased to have a peculiar interest and charm for me  the gloom through
which the great black mass holds its direct and certain course the
rushing water plainly heard but dimly seen the broad white
glistening track that follows in the vessels wake the men on the
look-out forward who would be scarcely visible against the dark sky but
for their blotting out some score of glistening stars the helmsman at
the wheel with the illuminated card before him shining a speck of
light amidst the darkness like something sentient and of divine
intelligence the melancholy sighing of the wind through block and rope
and chain the gleaming forth of light from every crevice nook and tiny
piece of glass about the decks as though the ship were filled with fire
in hiding ready to burst through any outlet wild with its resistless
power of death and ruin  at first too and even when the hour and all
the objects it exalts have come to be familiar it is difficult alone
and thoughtful to hold them to their proper shapes and forms  they
change with the wandering fancy assume the semblance of things left far
away put on the well-remembered aspect of favourite places dearly loved
and even people them with shadows  streets houses rooms figures so
like their usual occupants that they have startled me by their reality
which far exceeded as it seemed to me all power of mine to conjure up
the absent have many and many a time at such an hour grown suddenly
out of objects with whose real look and use and purpose i was as well
acquainted as with my own two hands

my own two hands and feet likewise being very cold however on this
particular occasion i crept below at midnight  it was not exactly
comfortable below  it was decidedly close and it was impossible to be
unconscious of the presence of that extraordinary compound of strange
smells which is to be found nowhere but on board ship and which is such
a subtle perfume that it seems to enter at every pore of the skin and
whisper of the hold  two passengers wives (one of them my own) lay
already in silent agonies on the sofa and one ladys maid (my ladys)
was a mere bundle on the floor execrating her destiny and pounding her
curl-papers among the stray boxes  everything sloped the wrong way
which in itself was an aggravation scarcely to be borne  i had left the
door open a moment before in the bosom of a gentle declivity and when
i turned to shut it it was on the summit of a lofty eminence  now every
plank and timber creaked as if the ship were made of wicker-work and
now crackled like an enormous fire of the driest possible twigs  there
was nothing for it but bed so i went to bed

it was pretty much the same for the next two days with a tolerably fair
wind and dry weather  i read in bed (but to this hour i dont know what)
a good deal and reeled on deck a little drank cold brandy-and-water
with an unspeakable disgust and ate hard biscuit perseveringly not ill
but going to be

it is the third morning  i am awakened out of my sleep by a dismal
shriek from my wife who demands to know whether theres any danger  i
rouse myself and look out of bed  the water-jug is plunging and leaping
like a lively dolphin all the smaller articles are afloat except my
shoes which are stranded on a carpet-bag high and dry like a couple of
coal-barges  suddenly i see them spring into the air and behold the
looking-glass which is nailed to the wall sticking fast upon the
ceiling  at the same time the door entirely disappears and a new one is
opened in the floor  then i begin to comprehend that the state-room is
standing on its head

before it is possible to make any arrangement at all compatible with this
novel state of things the ship rights  before one can say  thank
heaven she wrongs again  before one can cry she is wrong she seems
to have started forward and to be a creature actually running of its own
accord with broken knees and failing legs through every variety of hole
and pitfall and stumbling constantly  before one can so much as wonder
she takes a high leap into the air  before she has well done that she
takes a deep dive into the water  before she has gained the surface she
throws a summerset  the instant she is on her legs she rushes backward
and so she goes on staggering heaving wrestling leaping diving
jumping pitching throbbing rolling and rocking and going through all
these movements sometimes by turns and sometimes altogether until one
feels disposed to roar for mercy

a steward passes   steward   sir?   what is the matter? what do
you call this?   rather a heavy sea on sir and a head-wind

a head-wind  imagine a human face upon the vessels prow with fifteen
thousand samsons in one bent upon driving her back and hitting her
exactly between the eyes whenever she attempts to advance an inch
imagine the ship herself with every pulse and artery of her huge body
swollen and bursting under this maltreatment sworn to go on or die
imagine the wind howling the sea roaring the rain beating all in
furious array against her  picture the sky both dark and wild and the
clouds in fearful sympathy with the waves making another ocean in the
air  add to all this the clattering on deck and down below the tread
of hurried feet the loud hoarse shouts of seamen the gurgling in and
out of water through the scuppers with every now and then the striking
of a heavy sea upon the planks above with the deep dead heavy sound of
thunder heard within a vault—and there is the head-wind of that january
morning

i say nothing of what may be called the domestic noises of the ship such
as the breaking of glass and crockery the tumbling down of stewards the
gambols overhead of loose casks and truant dozens of bottled porter
and the very remarkable and far from exhilarating sounds raised in their
various state-rooms by the seventy passengers who were too ill to get up
to breakfast  i say nothing of them for although i lay listening to
this concert for three or four days i dont think i heard it for more
than a quarter of a minute at the expiration of which term i lay down
again excessively sea-sick

not sea-sick be it understood in the ordinary acceptation of the term
i wish i had been but in a form which i have never seen or heard
described though i have no doubt it is very common  i lay there all
the day long quite coolly and contentedly with no sense of weariness
with no desire to get up or get better or take the air with no
curiosity or care or regret of any sort or degree saving that i think
i can remember in this universal indifference having a kind of lazy
joy—of fiendish delight if anything so lethargic can be dignified with
the title—in the fact of my wife being too ill to talk to me  if i may
be allowed to illustrate my state of mind by such an example i should
say that i was exactly in the condition of the elder mr willet after
the incursion of the rioters into his bar at chigwell  nothing would
have surprised me  if in the momentary illumination of any ray of
intelligence that may have come upon me in the way of thoughts of home a
goblin postman with a scarlet coat and bell had come into that little
kennel before me broad awake in broad day and apologising for being
damp through walking in the sea had handed me a letter directed to
myself in familiar characters i am certain i should not have felt one
atom of astonishment i should have been perfectly satisfied  if neptune
himself had walked in with a toasted shark on his trident i should have
looked upon the event as one of the very commonest everyday occurrences

once—once—i found myself on deck  i dont know how i got there or what
possessed me to go there but there i was and completely dressed too
with a huge pea-coat on and a pair of boots such as no weak man in his
senses could ever have got into  i found myself standing when a gleam
of consciousness came upon me holding on to something  i dont know
what  i think it was the boatswain or it may have been the pump or
possibly the cow  i cant say how long i had been there whether a day
or a minute  i recollect trying to think about something (about anything
in the whole wide world i was not particular) without the smallest
effect  i could not even make out which was the sea and which the sky
for the horizon seemed drunk and was flying wildly about in all
directions  even in that incapable state however i recognised the lazy
gentleman standing before me nautically clad in a suit of shaggy blue
with an oilskin hat  but i was too imbecile although i knew it to be
he to separate him from his dress and tried to call him i remember
pilot  after another interval of total unconsciousness i found he had
gone and recognised another figure in its place  it seemed to wave and
fluctuate before me as though i saw it reflected in an unsteady
looking-glass but i knew it for the captain and such was the cheerful
influence of his face that i tried to smile yes even then i tried to
smile  i saw by his gestures that he addressed me but it was a long
time before i could make out that he remonstrated against my standing up
to my knees in water—as i was of course i dont know why  i tried to
thank him but couldnt  i could only point to my boots—or wherever i
supposed my boots to be—and say in a plaintive voice  cork soles at
the same time endeavouring i am told to sit down in the pool  finding
that i was quite insensible and for the time a maniac he humanely
conducted me below

there i remained until i got better suffering whenever i was
recommended to eat anything an amount of anguish only second to that
which is said to be endured by the apparently drowned in the process of
restoration to life  one gentleman on board had a letter of introduction
to me from a mutual friend in london  he sent it below with his card on
the morning of the head-wind and i was long troubled with the idea that
he might be up and well and a hundred times a day expecting me to call
upon him in the saloon  i imagined him one of those cast-iron images—i
will not call them men—who ask with red faces and lusty voices what
sea-sickness means and whether it really is as bad as it is represented
to be  this was very torturing indeed and i dont think i ever felt
such perfect gratification and gratitude of heart as i did when i heard
from the ships doctor that he had been obliged to put a large mustard
poultice on this very gentlemans stomach  i date my recovery from the
receipt of that intelligence

it was materially assisted though i have no doubt by a heavy gale of
wind which came slowly up at sunset when we were about ten days out
and raged with gradually increasing fury until morning saving that it
lulled for an hour a little before midnight  there was something in the
unnatural repose of that hour and in the after gathering of the storm
so inconceivably awful and tremendous that its bursting into full
violence was almost a relief

the labouring of the ship in the troubled sea on this night i shall never
forget   will it ever be worse than this? was a question i had often
heard asked when everything was sliding and bumping about and when it
certainly did seem difficult to comprehend the possibility of anything
afloat being more disturbed without toppling over and going down  but
what the agitation of a steam-vessel is on a bad winters night in the
wild atlantic it is impossible for the most vivid imagination to
conceive  to say that she is flung down on her side in the waves with
her masts dipping into them and that springing up again she rolls over
on the other side until a heavy sea strikes her with the noise of a
hundred great guns and hurls her back—that she stops and staggers and
shivers as though stunned and then with a violent throbbing at her
heart darts onward like a monster goaded into madness to be beaten
down and battered and crushed and leaped on by the angry sea—that
thunder lightning hail and rain and wind are all in fierce
contention for the mastery—that every plank has its groan every nail its
shriek and every drop of water in the great ocean its howling voice—is
nothing  to say that all is grand and all appalling and horrible in the
last degree is nothing  words cannot express it  thoughts cannot
convey it  only a dream can call it up again in all its fury rage and
passion

and yet in the very midst of these terrors i was placed in a situation
so exquisitely ridiculous that even then i had as strong a sense of its
absurdity as i have now and could no more help laughing than i can at
any other comical incident happening under circumstances the most
favourable to its enjoyment  about midnight we shipped a sea which
forced its way through the skylights burst open the doors above and
came raging and roaring down into the ladies cabin to the unspeakable
consternation of my wife and a little scotch lady—who by the way had
previously sent a message to the captain by the stewardess requesting
him with her compliments to have a steel conductor immediately attached
to the top of every mast and to the chimney in order that the ship
might not be struck by lightning  they and the handmaid before
mentioned being in such ecstasies of fear that i scarcely knew what to
do with them i naturally bethought myself of some restorative or
comfortable cordial and nothing better occurring to me at the moment
than hot brandy-and-water i procured a tumbler full without delay  it
being impossible to stand or sit without holding on they were all heaped
together in one corner of a long sofa—a fixture extending entirely across
the cabin—where they clung to each other in momentary expectation of
being drowned  when i approached this place with my specific and was
about to administer it with many consolatory expressions to the nearest
sufferer what was my dismay to see them all roll slowly down to the
other end  and when i staggered to that end and held out the glass once
more how immensely baffled were my good intentions by the ship giving
another lurch and their all rolling back again  i suppose i dodged them
up and down this sofa for at least a quarter of an hour without reaching
them once and by the time i did catch them the brandy-and-water was
diminished by constant spilling to a teaspoonful  to complete the
group it is necessary to recognise in this disconcerted dodger an
individual very pale from sea-sickness who had shaved his beard and
brushed his hair last at liverpool and whose only article of dress
(linen not included) were a pair of dreadnought trousers a blue jacket
formerly admired upon the thames at richmond no stockings and one
slipper

of the outrageous antics performed by that ship next morning which made
bed a practical joke and getting up by any process short of falling
out an impossibility i say nothing  but anything like the utter
dreariness and desolation that met my eyes when i literally  tumbled up
on deck at noon i never saw  ocean and sky were all of one dull heavy
uniform lead colour  there was no extent of prospect even over the
dreary waste that lay around us for the sea ran high and the horizon
encompassed us like a large black hoop  viewed from the air or some
tall bluff on shore it would have been imposing and stupendous no
doubt but seen from the wet and rolling decks it only impressed one
giddily and painfully  in the gale of last night the life-boat had been
crushed by one blow of the sea like a walnut-shell and there it hung
dangling in the air a mere faggot of crazy boards  the planking of the
paddle-boxes had been torn sheer away  the wheels were exposed and bare
and they whirled and dashed their spray about the decks at random
chimney white with crusted salt topmasts struck storm-sails set
rigging all knotted tangled wet and drooping a gloomier picture it
would be hard to look upon

i was now comfortably established by courtesy in the ladies cabin
where besides ourselves there were only four other passengers  first
the little scotch lady before mentioned on her way to join her husband
at new york who had settled there three years before  secondly and
thirdly an honest young yorkshireman connected with some american
house domiciled in that same city and carrying thither his beautiful
young wife to whom he had been married but a fortnight and who was the
fairest specimen of a comely english country girl i have ever seen
fourthly fifthly and lastly another couple newly married too if one
might judge from the endearments they frequently interchanged of whom i
know no more than that they were rather a mysterious run-away kind of
couple that the lady had great personal attractions also and that the
gentleman carried more guns with him than robinson crusoe wore a
shooting-coat and had two great dogs on board  on further
consideration i remember that he tried hot roast pig and bottled ale as
a cure for sea-sickness and that he took these remedies (usually in bed)
day after day with astonishing perseverance  i may add for the
information of the curious that they decidedly failed

the weather continuing obstinately and almost unprecedentedly bad we
usually straggled into this cabin more or less faint and miserable
about an hour before noon and lay down on the sofas to recover during
which interval the captain would look in to communicate the state of the
wind the moral certainty of its changing to-morrow (the weather is
always going to improve to-morrow at sea) the vessels rate of sailing
and so forth  observations there were none to tell us of for there was
no sun to take them by  but a description of one day will serve for all
the rest  here it is

the captain being gone we compose ourselves to read if the place be
light enough and if not we doze and talk alternately  at one a bell
rings and the stewardess comes down with a steaming dish of baked
potatoes and another of roasted apples and plates of pigs face cold
ham salt beef or perhaps a smoking mess of rare hot collops  we fall
to upon these dainties eat as much as we can (we have great appetites
now) and are as long as possible about it  if the fire will burn (it
will sometimes) we are pretty cheerful  if it wont we all remark to
each other that its very cold rub our hands cover ourselves with coats
and cloaks and lie down again to doze talk and read (provided as
aforesaid) until dinner-time  at five another bell rings and the
stewardess reappears with another dish of potatoes—boiled this time—and
store of hot meat of various kinds not forgetting the roast pig to be
taken medicinally  we sit down at table again (rather more cheerfully
than before) prolong the meal with a rather mouldy dessert of apples
grapes and oranges and drink our wine and brandy-and-water  the
bottles and glasses are still upon the table and the oranges and so
forth are rolling about according to their fancy and the ships way when
the doctor comes down by special nightly invitation to join our evening
rubber immediately on whose arrival we make a party at whist and as it
is a rough night and the cards will not lie on the cloth we put the
tricks in our pockets as we take them  at whist we remain with exemplary
gravity (deducting a short time for tea and toast) until eleven oclock
or thereabouts when the captain comes down again in a sou-wester hat
tied under his chin and a pilot-coat making the ground wet where he
stands  by this time the card-playing is over and the bottles and
glasses are again upon the table and after an hours pleasant
conversation about the ship the passengers and things in general the
captain (who never goes to bed and is never out of humour) turns up his
coat collar for the deck again shakes hands all round and goes laughing
out into the weather as merrily as to a birthday party

as to daily news there is no dearth of that commodity  this passenger
is reported to have lost fourteen pounds at vingt-et-un in the saloon
yesterday and that passenger drinks his bottle of champagne every day
and how he does it (being only a clerk) nobody knows  the head engineer
has distinctly said that there never was such times—meaning weather—and
four good hands are ill and have given in dead beat  several berths
are full of water and all the cabins are leaky  the ships cook
secretly swigging damaged whiskey has been found drunk and has been
played upon by the fire-engine until quite sober  all the stewards have
fallen down-stairs at various dinner-times and go about with plasters in
various places  the baker is ill and so is the pastry-cook  a new man
horribly indisposed has been required to fill the place of the latter
officer and has been propped and jammed up with empty casks in a little
house upon deck and commanded to roll out pie-crust which he protests
(being highly bilious) it is death to him to look at  news  a dozen
murders on shore would lack the interest of these slight incidents at
sea

divided between our rubber and such topics as these we were running (as
we thought) into halifax harbour on the fifteenth night with little
wind and a bright moon—indeed we had made the light at its outer
entrance and put the pilot in charge—when suddenly the ship struck upon
a bank of mud  an immediate rush on deck took place of course the sides
were crowded in an instant and for a few minutes we were in as lively a
state of confusion as the greatest lover of disorder would desire to see
the passengers and guns and water-casks and other heavy matters being
all huddled together aft however to lighten her in the head she was
soon got off and after some driving on towards an uncomfortable line of
objects (whose vicinity had been announced very early in the disaster by
a loud cry of  breakers a-head) and much backing of paddles and
heaving of the lead into a constantly decreasing depth of water we
dropped anchor in a strange outlandish-looking nook which nobody on board
could recognise although there was land all about us and so close that
we could plainly see the waving branches of the trees

it was strange enough in the silence of midnight and the dead stillness
that seemed to be created by the sudden and unexpected stoppage of the
engine which had been clanking and blasting in our ears incessantly for
so many days to watch the look of blank astonishment expressed in every
face beginning with the officers tracing it through all the passengers
and descending to the very stokers and furnacemen who emerged from
below one by one and clustered together in a smoky group about the
hatchway of the engine-room comparing notes in whispers  after throwing
up a few rockets and firing signal guns in the hope of being hailed from
the land or at least of seeing a light—but without any other sight or
sound presenting itself—it was determined to send a boat on shore  it
was amusing to observe how very kind some of the passengers were in
volunteering to go ashore in this same boat for the general good of
course not by any means because they thought the ship in an unsafe
position or contemplated the possibility of her heeling over in case the
tide were running out  nor was it less amusing to remark how desperately
unpopular the poor pilot became in one short minute  he had had his
passage out from liverpool and during the whole voyage had been quite a
notorious character as a teller of anecdotes and cracker of jokes  yet
here were the very men who had laughed the loudest at his jests now
flourishing their fists in his face loading him with imprecations and
defying him to his teeth as a villain

the boat soon shoved off with a lantern and sundry blue lights on board
and in less than an hour returned the officer in command bringing with
him a tolerably tall young tree which he had plucked up by the roots to
satisfy certain distrustful passengers whose minds misgave them that they
were to be imposed upon and shipwrecked and who would on no other terms
believe that he had been ashore or had done anything but fraudulently
row a little way into the mist specially to deceive them and compass
their deaths  our captain had foreseen from the first that we must be in
a place called the eastern passage and so we were  it was about the
last place in the world in which we had any business or reason to be but
a sudden fog and some error on the pilots part were the cause  we
were surrounded by banks and rocks and shoals of all kinds but had
happily drifted it seemed upon the only safe speck that was to be found
thereabouts  eased by this report and by the assurance that the tide
was past the ebb we turned in at three oclock in the morning

i was dressing about half-past nine next day when the noise above
hurried me on deck  when i had left it overnight it was dark foggy
and damp and there were bleak hills all round us  now we were gliding
down a smooth broad stream at the rate of eleven miles an hour our
colours flying gaily our crew rigged out in their smartest clothes our
officers in uniform again the sun shining as on a brilliant april day in
england the land stretched out on either side streaked with light
patches of snow white wooden houses people at their doors telegraphs
working flags hoisted wharfs appearing ships quays crowded with
people distant noises shouts men and boys running down steep places
towards the pier all more bright and gay and fresh to our unused eyes
than words can paint them  we came to a wharf paved with uplifted
faces got alongside and were made fast after some shouting and
straining of cables darted a score of us along the gangway almost as
soon as it was thrust out to meet us and before it had reached the
ship—and leaped upon the firm glad earth again

i suppose this halifax would have appeared an elysium though it had been
a curiosity of ugly dulness  but i carried away with me a most pleasant
impression of the town and its inhabitants and have preserved it to this
hour  nor was it without regret that i came home without having found
an opportunity of returning thither and once more shaking hands with the
friends i made that day

it happened to be the opening of the legislative council and general
assembly at which ceremonial the forms observed on the commencement of a
new session of parliament in england were so closely copied and so
gravely presented on a small scale that it was like looking at
westminster through the wrong end of a telescope  the governor as her
majestys representative delivered what may be called the speech from
the throne  he said what he had to say manfully and well  the military
band outside the building struck up “god save the queen” with great
vigour before his excellency had quite finished the people shouted the
ins rubbed their hands the outs shook their heads the government
party said there never was such a good speech the opposition declared
there never was such a bad one the speaker and members of the house of
assembly withdrew from the bar to say a great deal among themselves and
do a little and in short everything went on and promised to go on
just as it does at home upon the like occasions

the town is built on the side of a hill the highest point being
commanded by a strong fortress not yet quite finished  several streets
of good breadth and appearance extend from its summit to the water-side
and are intersected by cross streets running parallel with the river
the houses are chiefly of wood  the market is abundantly supplied and
provisions are exceedingly cheap  the weather being unusually mild at
that time for the season of the year there was no sleighing but there
were plenty of those vehicles in yards and by-places and some of them
from the gorgeous quality of their decorations might have  gone on
without alteration as triumphal cars in a melodrama at astleys  the day
was uncommonly fine the air bracing and healthful the whole aspect of
the town cheerful thriving and industrious

we lay there seven hours to deliver and exchange the mails  at length
having collected all our bags and all our passengers (including two or
three choice spirits who having indulged too freely in oysters and
champagne were found lying insensible on their backs in unfrequented
streets) the engines were again put in motion and we stood off for
boston

encountering squally weather again in the bay of fundy we tumbled and
rolled about as usual all that night and all next day  on the next
afternoon that is to say on saturday the twenty-second of january an
american pilot-boat came alongside and soon afterwards the britannia
steam-packet from liverpool eighteen days out was telegraphed at
boston

the indescribable interest with which i strained my eyes as the first
patches of american soil peeped like molehills from the green sea and
followed them as they swelled by slow and almost imperceptible degrees
into a continuous line of coast can hardly be exaggerated  a sharp keen
wind blew dead against us a hard frost prevailed on shore and the cold
was most severe  yet the air was so intensely clear and dry and
bright that the temperature was not only endurable but delicious

how i remained on deck staring about me until we came alongside the
dock and how though i had had as many eyes as argus i should have had
them all wide open and all employed on new objects—are topics which i
will not prolong this chapter to discuss  neither will i more than hint
at my foreigner-like mistake in supposing that a party of most active
persons who scrambled on board at the peril of their lives as we
approached the wharf were newsmen answering to that industrious class
at home whereas despite the leathern wallets of news slung about the
necks of some and the broad sheets in the hands of all they were
editors who boarded ships in person (as one gentleman in a worsted
comforter informed me)  because they liked the excitement of it
suffice it in this place to say that one of these invaders with a ready
courtesy for which i thank him here most gratefully went on before to
order rooms at the hotel and that when i followed as i soon did i
found myself rolling through the long passages with an involuntary
imitation of the gait of mr t p cooke in a new nautical melodrama

 dinner if you please said i to the waiter

 when? said the waiter

 as quick as possible said i

 right away? said the waiter

after a moments hesitation i answered  no at hazard

 not right away? cried the waiter with an amount of surprise that
made me start

i looked at him doubtfully and returned  no i would rather have it in
this private room  i like it very much

at this i really thought the waiter must have gone out of his mind as i
believe he would have done but for the interposition of another man who
whispered in his ear  directly

 well and thats a fact said the waiter looking helplessly at me
 right away

i saw now that  right away and  directly were one and the same thing
so i reversed my previous answer and sat down to dinner in ten minutes
afterwards and a capital dinner it was

the hotel (a very excellent one) is called the tremont house  it has
more galleries colonnades piazzas and passages than i can remember or
the reader would believe




chapter iii
boston


in all the public establishments of america the utmost courtesy
prevails  most of our departments are susceptible of considerable
improvement in this respect but the custom-house above all others would
do well to take example from the united states and render itself somewhat
less odious and offensive to foreigners  the servile rapacity of the
french officials is sufficiently contemptible but there is a surly
boorish incivility about our men alike disgusting to all persons who
fall into their hands and discreditable to the nation that keeps such
ill-conditioned curs snarling about its gates

when i landed in america i could not help being strongly impressed with
the contrast their custom-house presented and the attention politeness
and good humour with which its officers discharged their duty

as we did not land at boston in consequence of some detention at the
wharf until after dark i received my first impressions of the city in
walking down to the custom-house on the morning after our arrival which
was sunday  i am afraid to say by the way how many offers of pews and
seats in church for that morning were made to us by formal note of
invitation before we had half finished our first dinner in america but
if i may be allowed to make a moderate guess without going into nicer
calculation i should say that at least as many sittings were proffered
us as would have accommodated a score or two of grown-up families  the
number of creeds and forms of religion to which the pleasure of our
company was requested was in very fair proportion

not being able in the absence of any change of clothes to go to church
that day we were compelled to decline these kindnesses one and all and
i was reluctantly obliged to forego the delight of hearing dr channing
who happened to preach that morning for the first time in a very long
interval  i mention the name of this distinguished and accomplished man
(with whom i soon afterwards had the pleasure of becoming personally
acquainted) that i may have the gratification of recording my humble
tribute of admiration and respect for his high abilities and character
and for the bold philanthropy with which he has ever opposed himself to
that most hideous blot and foul disgrace—slavery

to return to boston  when i got into the streets upon this sunday
morning the air was so clear the houses were so bright and gay the
signboards were painted in such gaudy colours the gilded letters were so
very golden the bricks were so very red the stone was so very white
the blinds and area railings were so very green the knobs and plates
upon the street doors so marvellously bright and twinkling and all so
slight and unsubstantial in appearance—that every thoroughfare in the
city looked exactly like a scene in a pantomime  it rarely happens in
the business streets that a tradesman if i may venture to call anybody a
tradesman where everybody is a merchant resides above his store so
that many occupations are often carried on in one house and the whole
front is covered with boards and inscriptions  as i walked along i kept
glancing up at these boards confidently expecting to see a few of them
change into something and i never turned a corner suddenly without
looking out for the clown and pantaloon who i had no doubt were hiding
in a doorway or behind some pillar close at hand  as to harlequin and
columbine i discovered immediately that they lodged (they are always
looking after lodgings in a pantomime) at a very small clockmakers one
story high near the hotel which in addition to various symbols and
devices almost covering the whole front had a great dial hanging out—to
be jumped through of course

the suburbs are if possible even more unsubstantial-looking than the
city  the white wooden houses (so white that it makes one wink to look
at them) with their green jalousie blinds are so sprinkled and dropped
about in all directions without seeming to have any root at all in the
ground and the small churches and chapels are so prim and bright and
highly varnished that i almost believed the whole affair could be taken
up piecemeal like a childs toy and crammed into a little box

the city is a beautiful one and cannot fail i should imagine to
impress all strangers very favourably  the private dwelling-houses are
for the most part large and elegant the shops extremely good and the
public buildings handsome  the state house is built upon the summit of a
hill which rises gradually at first and afterwards by a steep ascent
almost from the waters edge  in front is a green enclosure called the
common  the site is beautiful and from the top there is a charming
panoramic view of the whole town and neighbourhood  in addition to a
variety of commodious offices it contains two handsome chambers in one
the house of representatives of the state hold their meetings in the
other the senate  such proceedings as i saw here were conducted with
perfect gravity and decorum and were certainly calculated to inspire
attention and respect

there is no doubt that much of the intellectual refinement and
superiority of boston is referable to the quiet influence of the
university of cambridge which is within three or four miles of the city
the resident professors at that university are gentlemen of learning and
varied attainments and are without one exception that i can call to
mind men who would shed a grace upon and do honour to any society in
the civilised world  many of the resident gentry in boston and its
neighbourhood and i think i am not mistaken in adding a large majority
of those who are attached to the liberal professions there have been
educated at this same school  whatever the defects of american
universities may be they disseminate no prejudices rear no bigots dig
up the buried ashes of no old superstitions never interpose between the
people and their improvement exclude no man because of his religious
opinions above all in their whole course of study and instruction
recognise a world and a broad one too lying beyond the college walls

it was a source of inexpressible pleasure to me to observe the almost
imperceptible but not less certain effect wrought by this institution
among the small community of boston and to note at every turn the
humanising tastes and desires it has engendered the affectionate
friendships to which it has given rise the amount of vanity and
prejudice it has dispelled  the golden calf they worship at boston is a
pigmy compared with the giant effigies set up in other parts of that vast
counting-house which lies beyond the atlantic and the almighty dollar
sinks into something comparatively insignificant amidst a whole pantheon
of better gods

above all i sincerely believe that the public institutions and charities
of this capital of massachusetts are as nearly perfect as the most
considerate wisdom benevolence and humanity can make them  i never in
my life was more affected by the contemplation of happiness under
circumstances of privation and bereavement than in my visits to these
establishments

it is a great and pleasant feature of all such institutions in america
that they are either supported by the state or assisted by the state or
(in the event of their not needing its helping hand) that they act in
concert with it and are emphatically the peoples  i cannot but think
with a view to the principle and its tendency to elevate or depress the
character of the industrious classes that a public charity is
immeasurably better than a private foundation no matter how munificently
the latter may be endowed  in our own country where it has not until
within these later days been a very popular fashion with governments to
display any extraordinary regard for the great mass of the people or to
recognise their existence as improvable creatures private charities
unexampled in the history of the earth have arisen to do an
incalculable amount of good among the destitute and afflicted  but the
government of the country having neither act nor part in them is not in
the receipt of any portion of the gratitude they inspire and offering
very little shelter or relief beyond that which is to be found in the
workhouse and the jail has come not unnaturally to be looked upon by
the poor rather as a stern master quick to correct and punish than a
kind protector merciful and vigilant in their hour of need

the maxim that out of evil cometh good is strongly illustrated by these
establishments at home as the records of the prerogative office in
doctors commons can abundantly prove  some immensely rich old gentleman
or lady surrounded by needy relatives makes upon a low average a will
a-week  the old gentleman or lady never very remarkable in the best of
times for good temper is full of aches and pains from head to foot full
of fancies and caprices full of spleen distrust suspicion and
dislike  to cancel old wills and invent new ones is at last the sole
business of such a testators existence and relations and friends (some
of whom have been bred up distinctly to inherit a large share of the
property and have been from their cradles specially disqualified from
devoting themselves to any useful pursuit on that account) are so often
and so unexpectedly and summarily cut off and reinstated and cut off
again that the whole family down to the remotest cousin is kept in a
perpetual fever  at length it becomes plain that the old lady or
gentleman has not long to live and the plainer this becomes the more
clearly the old lady or gentleman perceives that everybody is in a
conspiracy against their poor old dying relative wherefore the old lady
or gentleman makes another last will—positively the last this
time—conceals the same in a china teapot and expires next day  then it
turns out that the whole of the real and personal estate is divided
between half-a-dozen charities and that the dead and gone testator has
in pure spite helped to do a great deal of good at the cost of an
immense amount of evil passion and misery

the perkins institution and massachusetts asylum for the blind at
boston is superintended by a body of trustees who make an annual report
to the corporation  the indigent blind of that state are admitted
gratuitously  those from the adjoining state of connecticut or from the
states of maine vermont or new hampshire are admitted by a warrant
from the state to which they respectively belong or failing that must
find security among their friends for the payment of about twenty pounds
english for their first years board and instruction and ten for the
second   after the first year say the trustees  an account current
will be opened with each pupil he will be charged with the actual cost
of his board which will not exceed two dollars per week a trifle more
than eight shillings english  and he will be credited with the amount
paid for him by the state or by his friends also with his earnings over
and above the cost of the stock which he uses so that all his earnings
over one dollar per week will be his own  by the third year it will be
known whether his earnings will more than pay the actual cost of his
board if they should he will have it at his option to remain and
receive his earnings or not  those who prove unable to earn their own
livelihood will not be retained as it is not desirable to convert the
establishment into an alms-house or to retain any but working bees in
the hive  those who by physical or mental imbecility are disqualified
from work are thereby disqualified from being members of an industrious
community and they can be better provided for in establishments fitted
for the infirm

i went to see this place one very fine winter morning an italian sky
above and the air so clear and bright on every side that even my eyes
which are none of the best could follow the minute lines and scraps of
tracery in distant buildings  like most other public institutions in
america of the same class it stands a mile or two without the town in
a cheerful healthy spot and is an airy spacious handsome edifice  it
is built upon a height commanding the harbour  when i paused for a
moment at the door and marked how fresh and free the whole scene
was—what sparkling bubbles glanced upon the waves and welled up every
moment to the surface as though the world below like that above were
radiant with the bright day and gushing over in its fulness of light
when i gazed from sail to sail away upon a ship at sea a tiny speck of
shining white the only cloud upon the still deep distant blue—and
turning saw a blind boy with his sightless face addressed that way as
though he too had some sense within him of the glorious distance i felt
a kind of sorrow that the place should be so very light and a strange
wish that for his sake it were darker  it was but momentary of course
and a mere fancy but i felt it keenly for all that

the children were at their daily tasks in different rooms except a few
who were already dismissed and were at play  here as in many
institutions no uniform is worn and i was very glad of it for two
reasons  firstly because i am sure that nothing but senseless custom
and want of thought would reconcile us to the liveries and badges we are
so fond of at home  secondly because the absence of these things
presents each child to the visitor in his or her own proper character
with its individuality unimpaired not lost in a dull ugly monotonous
repetition of the same unmeaning garb which is really an important
consideration  the wisdom of encouraging a little harmless pride in
personal appearance even among the blind or the whimsical absurdity of
considering charity and leather breeches inseparable companions as we
do requires no comment

good order cleanliness and comfort pervaded every corner of the
building  the various classes who were gathered round their teachers
answered the questions put to them with readiness and intelligence and
in a spirit of cheerful contest for precedence which pleased me very
much  those who were at play were gleesome and noisy as other children
more spiritual and affectionate friendships appeared to exist among them
than would be found among other young persons suffering under no
deprivation but this i expected and was prepared to find  it is a part
of the great scheme of heavens merciful consideration for the afflicted

in a portion of the building set apart for that purpose are work-shops
for blind persons whose education is finished and who have acquired a
trade but who cannot pursue it in an ordinary manufactory because of
their deprivation  several people were at work here making brushes
mattresses and so forth and the cheerfulness industry and good order
discernible in every other part of the building extended to this
department also

on the ringing of a bell the pupils all repaired without any guide or
leader to a spacious music-hall where they took their seats in an
orchestra erected for that purpose and listened with manifest delight to
a voluntary on the organ played by one of themselves  at its
conclusion the performer a boy of nineteen or twenty gave place to a
girl and to her accompaniment they all sang a hymn and afterwards a
sort of chorus  it was very sad to look upon and hear them happy though
their condition unquestionably was and i saw that one blind girl who
(being for the time deprived of the use of her limbs by illness) sat
close beside me with her face towards them wept silently the while she
listened

it is strange to watch the faces of the blind and see how free they are
from all concealment of what is passing in their thoughts observing
which a man with eyes may blush to contemplate the mask he wears
allowing for one shade of anxious expression which is never absent from
their countenances and the like of which we may readily detect in our
own faces if we try to feel our way in the dark every idea as it rises
within them is expressed with the lightnings speed and natures truth
if the company at a rout or drawing-room at court could only for one
time be as unconscious of the eyes upon them as blind men and women are
what secrets would come out and what a worker of hypocrisy this sight
the loss of which we so much pity would appear to be

the thought occurred to me as i sat down in another room before a girl
blind deaf and dumb destitute of smell and nearly so of taste before
a fair young creature with every human faculty and hope and power of
goodness and affection inclosed within her delicate frame and but one
outward sense—the sense of touch  there she was before me built up as
it were in a marble cell impervious to any ray of light or particle of
sound with her poor white hand peeping through a chink in the wall
beckoning to some good man for help that an immortal soul might be
awakened

long before i looked upon her the help had come  her face was radiant
with intelligence and pleasure  her hair braided by her own hands was
bound about a head whose intellectual capacity and development were
beautifully expressed in its graceful outline and its broad open brow
her dress arranged by herself was a pattern of neatness and simplicity
the work she had knitted lay beside her her writing-book was on the
desk she leaned upon—from the mournful ruin of such bereavement there
had slowly risen up this gentle tender guileless grateful-hearted
being

like other inmates of that house she had a green ribbon bound round her
eyelids  a doll she had dressed lay near upon the ground  i took it up
and saw that she had made a green fillet such as she wore herself and
fastened it about its mimic eyes

she was seated in a little enclosure made by school-desks and forms
writing her daily journal  but soon finishing this pursuit she engaged
in an animated conversation with a teacher who sat beside her  this was
a favourite mistress with the poor pupil  if she could see the face of
her fair instructress she would not love her less i am sure

i have extracted a few disjointed fragments of her history from an
account written by that one man who has made her what she is  it is a
very beautiful and touching narrative and i wish i could present it
entire

her name is laura bridgman   she was born in hanover new hampshire on
the twenty-first of december 1829  she is described as having been a
very sprightly and pretty infant with bright blue eyes  she was
however so puny and feeble until she was a year and a half old that her
parents hardly hoped to rear her  she was subject to severe fits which
seemed to rack her frame almost beyond her power of endurance and life
was held by the feeblest tenure but when a year and a half old she
seemed to rally the dangerous symptoms subsided and at twenty months
old she was perfectly well

 then her mental powers hitherto stinted in their growth rapidly
developed themselves and during the four months of health which she
enjoyed she appears (making due allowance for a fond mothers account)
to have displayed a considerable degree of intelligence

 but suddenly she sickened again her disease raged with great violence
during five weeks when her eyes and ears were inflamed suppurated and
their contents were discharged  but though sight and hearing were gone
for ever the poor childs sufferings were not ended  the fever raged
during seven weeks for five months she was kept in bed in a darkened
room it was a year before she could walk unsupported and two years
before she could sit up all day  it was now observed that her sense of
smell was almost entirely destroyed and consequently that her taste
was much blunted

 it was not until four years of age that the poor childs bodily health
seemed restored and she was able to enter upon her apprenticeship of
life and the world

 but what a situation was hers  the darkness and the silence of the tomb
were around her no mothers smile called forth her answering smile no
fathers voice taught her to imitate his sounds—they brothers and
sisters were but forms of matter which resisted her touch but which
differed not from the furniture of the house save in warmth and in the
power of locomotion and not even in these respects from the dog and the
cat

 but the immortal spirit which had been implanted within her could not
die nor be maimed nor mutilated and though most of its avenues of
communication with the world were cut off it began to manifest itself
through the others  as soon as she could walk she began to explore the
room and then the house she became familiar with the form density
weight and heat of every article she could lay her hands upon  she
followed her mother and felt her hands and arms as she was occupied
about the house and her disposition to imitate led her to repeat
everything herself  she even learned to sew a little and to knit

the reader will scarcely need to be told however that the opportunities
of communicating with her were very very limited and that the moral
effects of her wretched state soon began to appear  those who cannot be
enlightened by reason can only be controlled by force and this coupled
with her great privations must soon have reduced her to a worse
condition than that of the beasts that perish but for timely and
unhoped-for aid

 at this time i was so fortunate as to hear of the child and
immediately hastened to hanover to see her  i found her with a
well-formed figure a strongly-marked nervous-sanguine temperament a
large and beautifully-shaped head and the whole system in healthy
action  the parents were easily induced to consent to her coming to
boston and on the 4th of october 1837 they brought her to the
institution

 for a while she was much bewildered and after waiting about two weeks
until she became acquainted with her new locality and somewhat familiar
with the inmates the attempt was made to give her knowledge of arbitrary
signs by which she could interchange thoughts with others

 there was one of two ways to be adopted either to go on to build up a
language of signs on the basis of the natural language which she had
already commenced herself or to teach her the purely arbitrary language
in common use that is to give her a sign for every individual thing or
to give her a knowledge of letters by combination of which she might
express her idea of the existence and the mode and condition of
existence of any thing  the former would have been easy but very
ineffectual the latter seemed very difficult but if accomplished very
effectual  i determined therefore to try the latter

 the first experiments were made by taking articles in common use such
as knives forks spoons keys &c and pasting upon them labels with
their names printed in raised letters  these she felt very carefully
and soon of course distinguished that the crooked lines spoon
differed as much from the crooked lines key as the spoon differed from
the key in form

 then small detached labels with the same words printed upon them were
put into her hands and she soon observed that they were similar to the
ones pasted on the articles   she showed her perception of this
similarity by laying the label key upon the key and the label spoon
upon the spoon  she was encouraged here by the natural sign of
approbation patting on the head

 the same process was then repeated with all the articles which she could
handle and she very easily learned to place the proper labels upon them
it was evident however that the only intellectual exercise was that of
imitation and memory  she recollected that the label book was placed
upon a book and she repeated the process first from imitation next from
memory with only the motive of love of approbation but apparently
without the intellectual perception of any relation between the things

 after a while instead of labels the individual letters were given to
her on detached bits of paper they were arranged side by side so as to
spell book key &c then they were mixed up in a heap and a sign
was made for her to arrange them herself so as to express the words
book key &c and she did so

 hitherto the process had been mechanical and the success about as
great as teaching a very knowing dog a variety of tricks  the poor child
had sat in mute amazement and patiently imitated everything her teacher
did but now the truth began to flash upon her her intellect began to
work she perceived that here was a way by which she could herself make
up a sign of anything that was in her own mind and show it to another
mind and at once her countenance lighted up with a human expression it
was no longer a dog or parrot it was an immortal spirit eagerly
seizing upon a new link of union with other spirits  i could almost fix
upon the moment when this truth dawned upon her mind and spread its
light to her countenance i saw that the great obstacle was overcome and
that henceforward nothing but patient and persevering but plain and
straightforward efforts were to be used

 the result thus far is quickly related and easily conceived but not
so was the process for many weeks of apparently unprofitable labour were
passed before it was effected

 when it was said above that a sign was made it was intended to say
that the action was performed by her teacher she feeling his hands and
then imitating the motion

 the next step was to procure a set of metal types with the different
letters of the alphabet cast upon their ends also a board in which were
square holes into which holes she could set the types so that the
letters on their ends could alone be felt above the surface

 then on any article being handed to her for instance a pencil or a
watch she would select the component letters and arrange them on her
board and read them with apparent pleasure

 she was exercised for several weeks in this way until her vocabulary
became extensive and then the important step was taken of teaching her
how to represent the different letters by the position of her fingers
instead of the cumbrous apparatus of the board and types  she
accomplished this speedily and easily for her intellect had begun to
work in aid of her teacher and her progress was rapid

 this was the period about three months after she had commenced that
the first report of her case was made in which it was stated that “she
has just learned the manual alphabet as used by the deaf mutes and it
is a subject of delight and wonder to see how rapidly correctly and
eagerly she goes on with her labours  her teacher gives her a new
object for instance a pencil first lets her examine it and get an
idea of its use then teaches her how to spell it by making the signs for
the letters with her own fingers the child grasps her hand and feels
her fingers as the different letters are formed she turns her head a
little on one side like a person listening closely her lips are apart
she seems scarcely to breathe and her countenance at first anxious
gradually changes to a smile as she comprehends the lesson  she then
holds up her tiny fingers and spells the word in the manual alphabet
next she takes her types and arranges her letters and last to make
sure that she is right she takes the whole of the types composing the
word and places them upon or in contact with the pencil or whatever the
object may be”

 the whole of the succeeding year was passed in gratifying her eager
inquiries for the names of every object which she could possibly handle
in exercising her in the use of the manual alphabet in extending in
every possible way her knowledge of the physical relations of things and
in proper care of her health

 at the end of the year a report of her case was made from which the
following is an extract

 “it has been ascertained beyond the possibility of doubt that she
cannot see a ray of light cannot hear the least sound and never
exercises her sense of smell if she have any  thus her mind dwells in
darkness and stillness as profound as that of a closed tomb at midnight
of beautiful sights and sweet sounds and pleasant odours she has no
conception nevertheless she seems as happy and playful as a bird or a
lamb and the employment of her intellectual faculties or the
acquirement of a new idea gives her a vivid pleasure which is plainly
marked in her expressive features  she never seems to repine but has
all the buoyancy and gaiety of childhood  she is fond of fun and frolic
and when playing with the rest of the children her shrill laugh sounds
loudest of the group

 “when left alone she seems very happy if she have her knitting or
sewing and will busy herself for hours if she have no occupation she
evidently amuses herself by imaginary dialogues or by recalling past
impressions she counts with her fingers or spells out names of things
which she has recently learned in the manual alphabet of the deaf mutes
in this lonely self-communion she seems to reason reflect and argue if
she spell a word wrong with the fingers of her right hand she instantly
strikes it with her left as her teacher does in sign of disapprobation
if right then she pats herself upon the head and looks pleased  she
sometimes purposely spells a word wrong with the left hand looks roguish
for a moment and laughs and then with the right hand strikes the left
as if to correct it

 “during the year she has attained great dexterity in the use of the
manual alphabet of the deaf mutes and she spells out the words and
sentences which she knows so fast and so deftly that only those
accustomed to this language can follow with the eye the rapid motions of
her fingers

 “but wonderful as is the rapidity with which she writes her thoughts
upon the air still more so is the ease and accuracy with which she reads
the words thus written by another grasping their hands in hers and
following every movement of their fingers as letter after letter conveys
their meaning to her mind  it is in this way that she converses with her
blind playmates and nothing can more forcibly show the power of mind in
forcing matter to its purpose than a meeting between them  for if great
talent and skill are necessary for two pantomimes to paint their thoughts
and feelings by the movements of the body and the expression of the
countenance how much greater the difficulty when darkness shrouds them
both and the one can hear no sound

 “when laura is walking through a passage-way with her hands spread
before her she knows instantly every one she meets and passes them with
a sign of recognition but if it be a girl of her own age and especially
if it be one of her favourites there is instantly a bright smile of
recognition a twining of arms a grasping of hands and a swift
telegraphing upon the tiny fingers whose rapid evolutions convey the
thoughts and feelings from the outposts of one mind to those of the
other  there are questions and answers exchanges of joy or sorrow
there are kissings and partings just as between little children with all
their senses”

 during this year and six months after she had left home her mother
came to visit her and the scene of their meeting was an interesting one

 the mother stood some time gazing with overflowing eyes upon her
unfortunate child who all unconscious of her presence was playing
about the room  presently laura ran against her and at once began
feeling her hands examining her dress and trying to find out if she
knew her but not succeeding in this she turned away as from a stranger
and the poor woman could not conceal the pang she felt at finding that
her beloved child did not know her

 she then gave laura a string of beads which she used to wear at home
which were recognised by the child at once who with much joy put them
around her neck and sought me eagerly to say she understood the string
was from her home

 the mother now sought to caress her but poor laura repelled her
preferring to be with her acquaintances

 another article from home was now given her and she began to look much
interested she examined the stranger much closer and gave me to
understand that she knew she came from hanover she even endured her
caresses but would leave her with indifference at the slightest signal
the distress of the mother was now painful to behold for although she
had feared that she should not be recognised the painful reality of
being treated with cold indifference by a darling child was too much for
womans nature to bear

 after a while on the mother taking hold of her again a vague idea
seemed to flit across lauras mind that this could not be a stranger
she therefore felt her hands very eagerly while her countenance assumed
an expression of intense interest she became very pale and then
suddenly red hope seemed struggling with doubt and anxiety and never
were contending emotions more strongly painted upon the human face at
this moment of painful uncertainty the mother drew her close to her
side and kissed her fondly when at once the truth flashed upon the
child and all mistrust and anxiety disappeared from her face as with an
expression of exceeding joy she eagerly nestled to the bosom of her
parent and yielded herself to her fond embraces

 after this the beads were all unheeded the playthings which were
offered to her were utterly disregarded her playmates for whom but a
moment before she gladly left the stranger now vainly strove to pull her
from her mother and though she yielded her usual instantaneous obedience
to my signal to follow me it was evidently with painful reluctance  she
clung close to me as if bewildered and fearful and when after a
moment i took her to her mother she sprang to her arms and clung to
her with eager joy

 the subsequent parting between them showed alike the affection the
intelligence and the resolution of the child

 laura accompanied her mother to the door clinging close to her all the
way until they arrived at the threshold where she paused and felt
around to ascertain who was near her  perceiving the matron of whom
she is very fond she grasped her with one hand holding on convulsively
to her mother with the other and thus she stood for a moment then she
dropped her mothers hand put her handkerchief to her eyes and turning
round clung sobbing to the matron while her mother departed with
emotions as deep as those of her child

                               * * * * * *

 it has been remarked in former reports that she can distinguish
different degrees of intellect in others and that she soon regarded
almost with contempt a new-comer when after a few days she discovered
her weakness of mind  this unamiable part of her character has been more
strongly developed during the past year

 she chooses for her friends and companions those children who are
intelligent and can talk best with her and she evidently dislikes to be
with those who are deficient in intellect unless indeed she can make
them serve her purposes which she is evidently inclined to do  she
takes advantage of them and makes them wait upon her in a manner that
she knows she could not exact of others and in various ways shows her
saxon blood

 she is fond of having other children noticed and caressed by the
teachers and those whom she respects but this must not be carried too
far or she becomes jealous  she wants to have her share which if not
the lions is the greater part and if she does not get it she says
“my mother will love me”

 her tendency to imitation is so strong that it leads her to actions
which must be entirely incomprehensible to her and which can give her no
other pleasure than the gratification of an internal faculty  she has
been known to sit for half an hour holding a book before her sightless
eyes and moving her lips as she has observed seeing people do when
reading

 she one day pretended that her doll was sick and went through all the
motions of tending it and giving it medicine she then put it carefully
to bed and placed a bottle of hot water to its feet laughing all the
time most heartily  when i came home she insisted upon my going to see
it and feel its pulse and when i told her to put a blister on its back
she seemed to enjoy it amazingly and almost screamed with delight

 her social feelings and her affections are very strong and when she
is sitting at work or at her studies by the side of one of her little
friends she will break off from her task every few moments to hug and
kiss them with an earnestness and warmth that is touching to behold

 when left alone she occupies and apparently amuses herself and seems
quite contented and so strong seems to be the natural tendency of
thought to put on the garb of language that she often soliloquizes in
the finger language slow and tedious as it is  but it is only when
alone that she is quiet for if she becomes sensible of the presence of
any one near her she is restless until she can sit close beside them
hold their hand and converse with them by signs

 in her intellectual character it is pleasing to observe an insatiable
thirst for knowledge and a quick perception of the relations of things
in her moral character it is beautiful to behold her continual gladness
her keen enjoyment of existence her expansive love her unhesitating
confidence her sympathy with suffering her conscientiousness
truthfulness and hopefulness

such are a few fragments from the simple but most interesting and
instructive history of laura bridgman  the name of her great benefactor
and friend who writes it is dr howe  there are not many persons i
hope and believe who after reading these passages can ever hear that
name with indifference

a further account has been published by dr howe since the report from
which i have just quoted  it describes her rapid mental growth and
improvement during twelve months more and brings her little history down
to the end of last year  it is very remarkable that as we dream in
words and carry on imaginary conversations in which we speak both for
ourselves and for the shadows who appear to us in those visions of the
night so she having no words uses her finger alphabet in her sleep
and it has been ascertained that when her slumber is broken and is much
disturbed by dreams she expresses her thoughts in an irregular and
confused manner on her fingers just as we should murmur and mutter them
indistinctly in the like circumstances

i turned over the leaves of her diary and found it written in a fair
legible square hand and expressed in terms which were quite intelligible
without any explanation  on my saying that i should like to see her
write again the teacher who sat beside her bade her in their language
sign her name upon a slip of paper twice or thrice  in doing so i
observed that she kept her left hand always touching and following up
her right in which of course she held the pen  no line was indicated
by any contrivance but she wrote straight and freely

she had until now been quite unconscious of the presence of visitors
but having her hand placed in that of the gentleman who accompanied me
she immediately expressed his name upon her teachers palm  indeed her
sense of touch is now so exquisite that having been acquainted with a
person once she can recognise him or her after almost any interval
this gentleman had been in her company i believe but very seldom and
certainly had not seen her for many months  my hand she rejected at
once as she does that of any man who is a stranger to her  but she
retained my wifes with evident pleasure kissed her and examined her
dress with a girls curiosity and interest

she was merry and cheerful and showed much innocent playfulness in her
intercourse with her teacher  her delight on recognising a favourite
playfellow and companion—herself a blind girl—who silently and with an
equal enjoyment of the coming surprise took a seat beside her was
beautiful to witness  it elicited from her at first as other slight
circumstances did twice or thrice during my visit an uncouth noise which
was rather painful to hear  but of her teacher touching her lips she
immediately desisted and embraced her laughingly and affectionately

i had previously been into another chamber where a number of blind boys
were swinging and climbing and engaged in various sports  they all
clamoured as we entered to the assistant-master who accompanied us
 look at me mr hart  please mr hart look at me evincing i
thought even in this an anxiety peculiar to their condition that their
little feats of agility should be seen  among them was a small
laughing fellow who stood aloof entertaining himself with a gymnastic
exercise for bringing the arms and chest into play which he enjoyed
mightily especially when in thrusting out his right arm he brought it
into contact with another boy  like laura bridgman this young child was
deaf and dumb and blind

dr howes account of this pupils first instruction is so very striking
and so intimately connected with laura herself that i cannot refrain
from a short extract  i may premise that the poor boys name is oliver
caswell that he is thirteen years of age and that he was in full
possession of all his faculties until three years and four months old
he was then attacked by scarlet fever in four weeks became deaf in a
few weeks more blind in six months dumb  he showed his anxious sense
of this last deprivation by often feeling the lips of other persons when
they were talking and then putting his hand upon his own as if to
assure himself that he had them in the right position

 his thirst for knowledge says dr howe  proclaimed itself as soon as
he entered the house by his eager examination of everything he could
feel or smell in his new location  for instance treading upon the
register of a furnace he instantly stooped down and began to feel it
and soon discovered the way in which the upper plate moved upon the lower
one but this was not enough for him so lying down upon his face he
applied his tongue first to one then to the other and seemed to
discover that they were of different kinds of metal

 his signs were expressive and the strictly natural language laughing
crying sighing kissing embracing &c was perfect

 some of the analogical signs which (guided by his faculty of imitation)
he had contrived were comprehensible such as the waving motion of his
hand for the motion of a boat the circular one for a wheel &c

 the first object was to break up the use of these signs and to
substitute for them the use of purely arbitrary ones

 profiting by the experience i had gained in the other cases i omitted
several steps of the process before employed and commenced at once with
the finger language  taking therefore several articles having short
names such as key cup mug &c and with laura for an auxiliary i sat
down and taking his hand placed it upon one of them and then with my
own made the letters key  he felt my hands eagerly with both of his
and on my repeating the process he evidently tried to imitate the
motions of my fingers  in a few minutes he contrived to feel the motions
of my fingers with one hand and holding out the other he tried to
imitate them laughing most heartily when he succeeded  laura was by
interested even to agitation and the two presented a singular sight her
face was flushed and anxious and her fingers twining in among ours so
closely as to follow every motion but so slightly as not to embarrass
them while oliver stood attentive his head a little aside his face
turned up his left hand grasping mine and his right held out at every
motion of my fingers his countenance betokened keen attention there was
an expression of anxiety as he tried to imitate the motions then a smile
came stealing out as he thought he could do so and spread into a joyous
laugh the moment he succeeded and felt me pat his head and laura clap
him heartily upon the back and jump up and down in her joy

 he learned more than a half-dozen letters in half an hour and seemed
delighted with his success at least in gaining approbation  his
attention then began to flag and i commenced playing with him  it was
evident that in all this he had merely been imitating the motions of my
fingers and placing his hand upon the key cup &c as part of the
process without any perception of the relation between the sign and the
object

 when he was tired with play i took him back to the table and he was
quite ready to begin again his process of imitation  he soon learned to
make the letters for key pen pin and by having the object
repeatedly placed in his hand he at last perceived the relation i wished
to establish between them  this was evident because when i made the
letters pin or pen or cup he would select the article

 the perception of this relation was not accompanied by that radiant
flash of intelligence and that glow of joy which marked the delightful
moment when laura first perceived it  i then placed all the articles on
the table and going away a little distance with the children placed
olivers fingers in the positions to spell key on which laura went and
brought the article the little fellow seemed much amused by this and
looked very attentive and smiling  i then caused him to make the letters
bread and in an instant laura went and brought him a piece he smelled
at it put it to his lips cocked up his head with a most knowing look
seemed to reflect a moment and then laughed outright as much as to say
“aha  i understand now how something may be made out of this”

 it was now clear that he had the capacity and inclination to learn that
he was a proper subject for instruction and needed only persevering
attention  i therefore put him in the hands of an intelligent teacher
nothing doubting of his rapid progress

well may this gentleman call that a delightful moment in which some
distant promise of her present state first gleamed upon the darkened mind
of laura bridgman  throughout his life the recollection of that moment
will be to him a source of pure unfading happiness nor will it shine
less brightly on the evening of his days of noble usefulness

the affection which exists between these two—the master and the pupil—is
as far removed from all ordinary care and regard as the circumstances in
which it has had its growth are apart from the common occurrences of
life  he is occupied now in devising means of imparting to her higher
knowledge and of conveying to her some adequate idea of the great
creator of that universe in which dark and silent and scentless though
it be to her she has such deep delight and glad enjoyment

ye who have eyes and see not and have ears and hear not ye who are as
the hypocrites of sad countenances and disfigure your faces that ye may
seem unto men to fast learn healthy cheerfulness and mild contentment
from the deaf and dumb and blind  self-elected saints with gloomy
brows this sightless earless voiceless child may teach you lessons you
will do well to follow  let that poor hand of hers lie gently on your
hearts for there may be something in its healing touch akin to that of
the great master whose precepts you misconstrue whose lessons you
pervert of whose charity and sympathy with all the world not one among
you in his daily practice knows as much as many of the worst among those
fallen sinners to whom you are liberal in nothing but the preachment of
perdition

as i rose to quit the room a pretty little child of one of the
attendants came running in to greet its father  for the moment a child
with eyes among the sightless crowd impressed me almost as painfully as
the blind boy in the porch had done two hours ago  ah how much
brighter and more deeply blue glowing and rich though it had been
before was the scene without contrasting with the darkness of so many
youthful lives within

                                * * * * *

at south boston as it is called in a situation excellently adapted for
the purpose several charitable institutions are clustered together  one
of these is the state hospital for the insane admirably conducted on
those enlightened principles of conciliation and kindness which twenty
years ago would have been worse than heretical and which have been acted
upon with so much success in our own pauper asylum at hanwell   evince a
desire to show some confidence and repose some trust even in mad
people said the resident physician as we walked along the galleries
his patients flocking round us unrestrained  of those who deny or doubt
the wisdom of this maxim after witnessing its effects if there be such
people still alive i can only say that i hope i may never be summoned as
a juryman on a commission of lunacy whereof they are the subjects for i
should certainly find them out of their senses on such evidence alone

each ward in this institution is shaped like a long gallery or hall with
the dormitories of the patients opening from it on either hand  here
they work read play at skittles and other games and when the weather
does not admit of their taking exercise out of doors pass the day
together  in one of these rooms seated calmly and quite as a matter
of course among a throng of mad-women black and white were the
physicians wife and another lady with a couple of children  these
ladies were graceful and handsome and it was not difficult to perceive
at a glance that even their presence there had a highly beneficial
influence on the patients who were grouped about them

leaning her head against the chimney-piece with a great assumption of
dignity and refinement of manner sat an elderly female in as many
scraps of finery as madge wildfire herself  her head in particular was
so strewn with scraps of gauze and cotton and bits of paper and had so
many queer odds and ends stuck all about it that it looked like a
birds-nest  she was radiant with imaginary jewels wore a rich pair of
undoubted gold spectacles and gracefully dropped upon her lap as we
approached a very old greasy newspaper in which i dare say she had been
reading an account of her own presentation at some foreign court

i have been thus particular in describing her because she will serve to
exemplify the physicians manner of acquiring and retaining the
confidence of his patients

 this he said aloud taking me by the hand and advancing to the
fantastic figure with great politeness—not raising her suspicions by the
slightest look or whisper or any kind of aside to me  this lady is the
hostess of this mansion sir  it belongs to her  nobody else has
anything whatever to do with it  it is a large establishment as you
see and requires a great number of attendants  she lives you observe
in the very first style  she is kind enough to receive my visits and to
permit my wife and family to reside here for which it is hardly
necessary to say we are much indebted to her  she is exceedingly
courteous you perceive on this hint she bowed condescendingly  and
will permit me to have the pleasure of introducing you a gentleman from
england maam newly arrived from england after a very tempestuous
passage mr dickens—the lady of the house

we exchanged the most dignified salutations with profound gravity and
respect and so went on  the rest of the madwomen seemed to understand
the joke perfectly (not only in this case but in all the others except
their own) and be highly amused by it  the nature of their several
kinds of insanity was made known to me in the same way and we left each
of them in high good humour  not only is a thorough confidence
established by those means between the physician and patient in
respect of the nature and extent of their hallucinations but it is easy
to understand that opportunities are afforded for seizing any moment of
reason to startle them by placing their own delusion before them in its
most incongruous and ridiculous light

every patient in this asylum sits down to dinner every day with a knife
and fork and in the midst of them sits the gentleman whose manner of
dealing with his charges i have just described  at every meal moral
influence alone restrains the more violent among them from cutting the
throats of the rest but the effect of that influence is reduced to an
absolute certainty and is found even as a means of restraint to say
nothing of it as a means of cure a hundred times more efficacious than
all the strait-waistcoats fetters and handcuffs that ignorance
prejudice and cruelty have manufactured since the creation of the world

in the labour department every patient is as freely trusted with the
tools of his trade as if he were a sane man  in the garden and on the
farm they work with spades rakes and hoes  for amusement they walk
run fish paint read and ride out to take the air in carriages
provided for the purpose  they have among themselves a sewing society to
make clothes for the poor which holds meetings passes resolutions
never comes to fisty-cuffs or bowie-knives as sane assemblies have been
known to do elsewhere and conducts all its proceedings with the greatest
decorum  the irritability which would otherwise be expended on their
own flesh clothes and furniture is dissipated in these pursuits  they
are cheerful tranquil and healthy

once a week they have a ball in which the doctor and his family with
all the nurses and attendants take an active part  dances and marches
are performed alternately to the enlivening strains of a piano and now
and then some gentleman or lady (whose proficiency has been previously
ascertained) obliges the company with a song nor does it ever
degenerate at a tender crisis into a screech or howl wherein i must
confess i should have thought the danger lay  at an early hour they all
meet together for these festive purposes at eight oclock refreshments
are served and at nine they separate

immense politeness and good breeding are observed throughout  they all
take their tone from the doctor and he moves a very chesterfield among
the company  like other assemblies these entertainments afford a
fruitful topic of conversation among the ladies for some days and the
gentlemen are so anxious to shine on these occasions that they have been
sometimes found  practising their steps in private to cut a more
distinguished figure in the dance

it is obvious that one great feature of this system is the inculcation
and encouragement even among such unhappy persons of a decent
self-respect  something of the same spirit pervades all the institutions
at south boston

there is the house of industry  in that branch of it which is devoted
to the reception of old or otherwise helpless paupers these words are
painted on the walls  worthy of notice  self-government quietude and
peace are blessings  it is not assumed and taken for granted that
being there they must be evil-disposed and wicked people before whose
vicious eyes it is necessary to flourish threats and harsh restraints
they are met at the very threshold with this mild appeal  all
within-doors is very plain and simple as it ought to be but arranged
with a view to peace and comfort  it costs no more than any other plan
of arrangement but it speaks an amount of consideration for those who
are reduced to seek a shelter there which puts them at once upon their
gratitude and good behaviour  instead of being parcelled out in great
long rambling wards where a certain amount of weazen life may mope and
pine and shiver all day long the building is divided into separate
rooms each with its share of light and air  in these the better kind
of paupers live  they have a motive for exertion and becoming pride in
the desire to make these little chambers comfortable and decent

i do not remember one but it was clean and neat and had its plant or two
upon the window-sill or row of crockery upon the shelf or small display
of coloured prints upon the whitewashed wall or perhaps its wooden
clock behind the door

the orphans and young children are in an adjoining building separate from
this but a part of the same institution  some are such little
creatures that the stairs are of lilliputian measurement fitted to
their tiny strides  the same consideration for their years and weakness
is expressed in their very seats which are perfect curiosities and look
like articles of furniture for a pauper dolls-house  i can imagine the
glee of our poor law commissioners at the notion of these seats having
arms and backs but small spines being of older date than their
occupation of the board-room at somerset house i thought even this
provision very merciful and kind

here again i was greatly pleased with the inscriptions on the wall
which were scraps of plain morality easily remembered and understood
such as  love one another— god remembers the smallest creature in his
creation and straightforward advice of that nature  the books and
tasks of these smallest of scholars were adapted in the same judicious
manner to their childish powers  when we had examined these lessons
four morsels of girls (of whom one was blind) sang a little song about
the merry month of may which i thought (being extremely dismal) would
have suited an english november better  that done we went to see their
sleeping-rooms on the floor above in which the arrangements were no less
excellent and gentle than those we had seen below  and after observing
that the teachers were of a class and character well suited to the spirit
of the place i took leave of the infants with a lighter heart than ever
i have taken leave of pauper infants yet

connected with the house of industry there is also an hospital which
was in the best order and had i am glad to say many beds unoccupied
it had one fault however which is common to all american interiors the
presence of the eternal accursed suffocating red-hot demon of a stove
whose breath would blight the purest air under heaven

there are two establishments for boys in this same neighbourhood  one is
called the boylston school and is an asylum for neglected and indigent
boys who have committed no crime but who in the ordinary course of
things would very soon be purged of that distinction if they were not
taken from the hungry streets and sent here  the other is a house of
reformation for juvenile offenders  they are both under the same roof
but the two classes of boys never come in contact

the boylston boys as may be readily supposed have very much the
advantage of the others in point of personal appearance  they were in
their school-room when i came upon them and answered correctly without
book such questions as where was england how far was it what was its
population its capital city its form of government and so forth  they
sang a song too about a farmer sowing his seed with corresponding
action at such parts as  tis thus he sows  he turns him round  he
claps his hands which gave it greater interest for them and accustomed
them to act together in an orderly manner  they appeared exceedingly
well-taught and not better taught than fed for a more chubby-looking
full-waistcoated set of boys i never saw

the juvenile offenders had not such pleasant faces by a great deal and
in this establishment there were many boys of colour  i saw them first
at their work (basket-making and the manufacture of palm-leaf hats)
afterwards in their school where they sang a chorus in praise of
liberty an odd and one would think rather aggravating theme for
prisoners  these boys are divided into four classes each denoted by a
numeral worn on a badge upon the arm  on the arrival of a new-comer he
is put into the fourth or lowest class and left by good behaviour to
work his way up into the first  the design and object of this
institution is to reclaim the youthful criminal by firm but kind and
judicious treatment to make his prison a place of purification and
improvement not of demoralisation and corruption to impress upon him
that there is but one path and that one sober industry which can ever
lead him to happiness to teach him how it may be trodden if his
footsteps have never yet been led that way and to lure him back to it if
they have strayed in a word to snatch him from destruction and restore
him to society a penitent and useful member  the importance of such an
establishment in every point of view and with reference to every
consideration of humanity and social policy requires no comment

one other establishment closes the catalogue  it is the house of
correction for the state in which silence is strictly maintained but
where the prisoners have the comfort and mental relief of seeing each
other and of working together  this is the improved system of prison
discipline which we have imported into england and which has been in
successful operation among us for some years past

america as a new and not over-populated country has in all her prisons
the one great advantage of being enabled to find useful and profitable
work for the inmates whereas with us the prejudice against prison
labour is naturally very strong and almost insurmountable when honest
men who have not offended against the laws are frequently doomed to seek
employment in vain  even in the united states the principle of bringing
convict labour and free labour into a competition which must obviously be
to the disadvantage of the latter has already found many opponents
whose number is not likely to diminish with access of years

for this very reason though our best prisons would seem at the first
glance to be better conducted than those of america  the treadmill is
conducted with little or no noise five hundred men may pick oakum in the
same room without a sound and both kinds of labour admit of such keen
and vigilant superintendence as will render even a word of personal
communication amongst the prisoners almost impossible  on the other
hand the noise of the loom the forge the carpenters hammer or the
stonemasons saw greatly favour those opportunities of
intercourse—hurried and brief no doubt but opportunities still—which
these several kinds of work by rendering it necessary for men to be
employed very near to each other and often side by side without any
barrier or partition between them in their very nature present  a
visitor too requires to reason and reflect a little before the sight
of a number of men engaged in ordinary labour such as he is accustomed
to out of doors will impress him half as strongly as the contemplation
of the same persons in the same place and garb would if they were
occupied in some task marked and degraded everywhere as belonging only
to felons in jails  in an american state prison or house of correction
i found it difficult at first to persuade myself that i was really in a
jail a place of ignominious punishment and endurance  and to this hour
i very much question whether the humane boast that it is not like one
has its root in the true wisdom or philosophy of the matter

i hope i may not be misunderstood on this subject for it is one in which
i take a strong and deep interest  i incline as little to the sickly
feeling which makes every canting lie or maudlin speech of a notorious
criminal a subject of newspaper report and general sympathy as i do to
those good old customs of the good old times which made england even so
recently as in the reign of the third king george in respect of her
criminal code and her prison regulations one of the most bloody-minded
and barbarous countries on the earth  if i thought it would do any good
to the rising generation i would cheerfully give my consent to the
disinterment of the bones of any genteel highwayman (the more genteel
the more cheerfully) and to their exposure piecemeal on any sign-post
gate or gibbet that might be deemed a good elevation for the purpose
my reason is as well convinced that these gentry were as utterly
worthless and debauched villains as it is that the laws and jails
hardened them in their evil courses or that their wonderful escapes were
effected by the prison-turnkeys who in those admirable days had always
been felons themselves and were to the last their bosom-friends and
pot-companions  at the same time i know as all men do or should that
the subject of prison discipline is one of the highest importance to any
community and that in her sweeping reform and bright example to other
countries on this head america has shown great wisdom great
benevolence and exalted policy  in contrasting her system with that
which we have modelled upon it i merely seek to show that with all its
drawbacks ours has some advantages of its own

the house of correction which has led to these remarks is not walled
like other prisons but is palisaded round about with tall rough stakes
something after the manner of an enclosure for keeping elephants in as
we see it represented in eastern prints and pictures  the prisoners wear
a parti-coloured dress and those who are sentenced to hard labour work
at nail-making or stone-cutting  when i was there the latter class of
labourers were employed upon the stone for a new custom-house in course
of erection at boston  they appeared to shape it skilfully and with
expedition though there were very few among them (if any) who had not
acquired the art within the prison gates

the women all in one large room were employed in making light clothing
for new orleans and the southern states  they did their work in silence
like the men and like them were over-looked by the person contracting
for their labour or by some agent of his appointment  in addition to
this they are every moment liable to be visited by the prison officers
appointed for that purpose

the arrangements for cooking washing of clothes and so forth are much
upon the plan of those i have seen at home  their mode of bestowing the
prisoners at night (which is of general adoption) differs from ours and
is both simple and effective  in the centre of a lofty area lighted by
windows in the four walls are five tiers of cells one above the other
each tier having before it a light iron gallery attainable by stairs of
the same construction and material excepting the lower one which is on
the ground  behind these back to back with them and facing the opposite
wall are five corresponding rows of cells accessible by similar means
so that supposing the prisoners locked up in their cells an officer
stationed on the ground with his back to the wall has half their number
under his eye at once the remaining half being equally under the
observation of another officer on the opposite side and all in one great
apartment  unless this watch be corrupted or sleeping on his post it is
impossible for a man to escape for even in the event of his forcing the
iron door of his cell without noise (which is exceedingly improbable)
the moment he appears outside and steps into that one of the five
galleries on which it is situated he must be plainly and fully visible
to the officer below  each of these cells holds a small truckle bed in
which one prisoner sleeps never more  it is small of course and the
door being not solid but grated and without blind or curtain the
prisoner within is at all times exposed to the observation and inspection
of any guard who may pass along that tier at any hour or minute of the
night  every day the prisoners receive their dinner singly through a
trap in the kitchen wall and each man carries his to his sleeping cell
to eat it where he is locked up alone for that purpose one hour  the
whole of this arrangement struck me as being admirable and i hope that
the next new prison we erect in england may be built on this plan

i was given to understand that in this prison no swords or fire-arms or
even cudgels are kept nor is it probable that so long as its present
excellent management continues any weapon offensive or defensive will
ever be required within its bounds

such are the institutions at south boston  in all of them the
unfortunate or degenerate citizens of the state are carefully instructed
in their duties both to god and man are surrounded by all reasonable
means of comfort and happiness that their condition will admit of are
appealed to as members of the great human family however afflicted
indigent or fallen are ruled by the strong heart and not by the strong
(though immeasurably weaker) hand  i have described them at some length
firstly because their worth demanded it and secondly because i mean to
take them for a model and to content myself with saying of others we may
come to whose design and purpose are the same that in this or that
respect they practically fail or differ

i wish by this account of them imperfect in its execution but in its
just intention honest i could hope to convey to my readers
one-hundredth part of the gratification the sights i have described
afforded me

                                * * * * *

to an englishman accustomed to the paraphernalia of westminster hall an
american court of law is as odd a sight as i suppose an english court
of law would be to an american  except in the supreme court at
washington (where the judges wear a plain black robe) there is no such
thing as a wig or gown connected with the administration of justice  the
gentlemen of the bar being barristers and attorneys too (for there is no
division of those functions as in england) are no more removed from their
clients than attorneys in our court for the relief of insolvent debtors
are from theirs  the jury are quite at home and make themselves as
comfortable as circumstances will permit  the witness is so little
elevated above or put aloof from the crowd in the court that a
stranger entering during a pause in the proceedings would find it
difficult to pick him out from the rest  and if it chanced to be a
criminal trial his eyes in nine cases out of ten would wander to the
dock in search of the prisoner in vain for that gentleman would most
likely be lounging among the most distinguished ornaments of the legal
profession whispering suggestions in his counsels ear or making a
toothpick out of an old quill with his penknife

i could not but notice these differences when i visited the courts at
boston  i was much surprised at first too to observe that the counsel
who interrogated the witness under examination at the time did so
sitting  but seeing that he was also occupied in writing down the
answers and remembering that he was alone and had no  junior i quickly
consoled myself with the reflection that law was not quite so expensive
an article here as at home and that the absence of sundry formalities
which we regard as indispensable had doubtless a very favourable
influence upon the bill of costs

in every court ample and commodious provision is made for the
accommodation of the citizens  this is the case all through america  in
every public institution the right of the people to attend and to have
an interest in the proceedings is most fully and distinctly recognised
there are no grim door-keepers to dole out their tardy civility by the
sixpenny-worth nor is there i sincerely believe any insolence of
office of any kind  nothing national is exhibited for money and no
public officer is a showman  we have begun of late years to imitate this
good example  i hope we shall continue to do so and that in the fulness
of time even deans and chapters may be converted

in the civil court an action was trying for damages sustained in some
accident upon a railway  the witnesses had been examined and counsel
was addressing the jury  the learned gentleman (like a few of his
english brethren) was desperately long-winded and had a remarkable
capacity of saying the same thing over and over again  his great theme
was  warren the ěngine driver whom he pressed into the service of
every sentence he uttered  i listened to him for about a quarter of an
hour and coming out of court at the expiration of that time without
the faintest ray of enlightenment as to the merits of the case felt as
if i were at home again

in the prisoners cell waiting to be examined by the magistrate on a
charge of theft was a boy  this lad instead of being committed to a
common jail would be sent to the asylum at south boston and there
taught a trade and in the course of time he would be bound apprentice to
some respectable master  thus his detection in this offence instead of
being the prelude to a life of infamy and a miserable death would lead
there was a reasonable hope to his being reclaimed from vice and
becoming a worthy member of society

i am by no means a wholesale admirer of our legal solemnities many of
which impress me as being exceedingly ludicrous  strange as it may seem
too there is undoubtedly a degree of protection in the wig and gown—a
dismissal of individual responsibility in dressing for the part—which
encourages that insolent bearing and language and that gross perversion
of the office of a pleader for the truth so frequent in our courts of
law  still i cannot help doubting whether america in her desire to
shake off the absurdities and abuses of the old system may not have gone
too far into the opposite extreme and whether it is not desirable
especially in the small community of a city like this where each man
knows the other to surround the administration of justice with some
artificial barriers against the  hail fellow well met deportment of
everyday life  all the aid it can have in the very high character and
ability of the bench not only here but elsewhere it has and well
deserves to have but it may need something more not to impress the
thoughtful and the well-informed but the ignorant and heedless a class
which includes some prisoners and many witnesses  these institutions
were established no doubt upon the principle that those who had so
large a share in making the laws would certainly respect them  but
experience has proved this hope to be fallacious for no men know better
than the judges of america that on the occasion of any great popular
excitement the law is powerless and cannot for the time assert its own
supremacy

the tone of society in boston is one of perfect politeness courtesy and
good breeding  the ladies are unquestionably very beautiful—in face but
there i am compelled to stop  their education is much as with us
neither better nor worse  i had heard some very marvellous stories in
this respect but not believing them was not disappointed  blue ladies
there are in boston but like philosophers of that colour and sex in
most other latitudes they rather desire to be thought superior than to
be so  evangelical ladies there are likewise whose attachment to the
forms of religion and horror of theatrical entertainments are most
exemplary  ladies who have a passion for attending lectures are to be
found among all classes and all conditions  in the kind of provincial
life which prevails in cities such as this the pulpit has great
influence  the peculiar province of the pulpit in new england (always
excepting the unitarian ministry) would appear to be the denouncement of
all innocent and rational amusements  the church the chapel and the
lecture-room are the only means of excitement excepted and to the
church the chapel and the lecture-room the ladies resort in crowds

wherever religion is resorted to as a strong drink and as an escape
from the dull monotonous round of home those of its ministers who pepper
the highest will be the surest to please  they who strew the eternal
path with the greatest amount of brimstone and who most ruthlessly tread
down the flowers and leaves that grow by the wayside will be voted the
most righteous and they who enlarge with the greatest pertinacity on the
difficulty of getting into heaven will be considered by all true
believers certain of going there though it would be hard to say by what
process of reasoning this conclusion is arrived at  it is so at home
and it is so abroad  with regard to the other means of excitement the
lecture it has at least the merit of being always new  one lecture
treads so quickly on the heels of another that none are remembered and
the course of this month may be safely repeated next with its charm of
novelty unbroken and its interest unabated

the fruits of the earth have their growth in corruption  out of the
rottenness of these things there has sprung up in boston a sect of
philosophers known as transcendentalists  on inquiring what this
appellation might be supposed to signify i was given to understand that
whatever was unintelligible would be certainly transcendental  not
deriving much comfort from this elucidation i pursued the inquiry still
further and found that the transcendentalists are followers of my friend
mr carlyle or i should rather say of a follower of his mr ralph
waldo emerson  this gentleman has written a volume of essays in which
among much that is dreamy and fanciful (if he will pardon me for saying
so) there is much more that is true and manly honest and bold
transcendentalism has its occasional vagaries (what school has not?) but
it has good healthful qualities in spite of them not least among the
number a hearty disgust of cant and an aptitude to detect her in all the
million varieties of her everlasting wardrobe  and therefore if i were a
bostonian i think i would be a transcendentalist

the only preacher i heard in boston was mr taylor who addresses himself
peculiarly to seamen and who was once a mariner himself  i found his
chapel down among the shipping in one of the narrow old water-side
streets with a gay blue flag waving freely from its roof  in the
gallery opposite to the pulpit were a little choir of male and female
singers a violoncello and a violin  the preacher already sat in the
pulpit which was raised on pillars and ornamented behind him with
painted drapery of a lively and somewhat theatrical appearance  he
looked a weather-beaten hard-featured man of about six or eight and
fifty with deep lines graven as it were into his face dark hair and a
stern keen eye  yet the general character of his countenance was
pleasant and agreeable  the service commenced with a hymn to which
succeeded an extemporary prayer  it had the fault of frequent
repetition incidental to all such prayers but it was plain and
comprehensive in its doctrines and breathed a tone of general sympathy
and charity which is not so commonly a characteristic of this form of
address to the deity as it might be  that done he opened his discourse
taking for his text a passage from the song of solomon laid upon the
desk before the commencement of the service by some unknown member of the
congregation  who is this coming up from the wilderness leaning on the
arm of her beloved

he handled his text in all kinds of ways and twisted it into all manner
of shapes but always ingeniously and with a rude eloquence well
adapted to the comprehension of his hearers  indeed if i be not
mistaken he studied their sympathies and understandings much more than
the display of his own powers  his imagery was all drawn from the sea
and from the incidents of a seamans life and was often remarkably good
he spoke to them of  that glorious man lord nelson and of collingwood
and drew nothing in as the saying is by the head and shoulders but
brought it to bear upon his purpose naturally and with a sharp mind to
its effect  sometimes when much excited with his subject he had an odd
way—compounded of john bunyan and balfour of burley—of taking his great
quarto bible under his arm and pacing up and down the pulpit with it
looking steadily down meantime into the midst of the congregation
thus when he applied his text to the first assemblage of his hearers
and pictured the wonder of the church at their presumption in forming a
congregation among themselves he stopped short with his bible under his
arm in the manner i have described and pursued his discourse after this
manner

 who are these—who are they—who are these fellows? where do they come
from?  where are they going to?—come from  whats the answer?—leaning
out of the pulpit and pointing downward with his right hand  from
below—starting back again and looking at the sailors before him  from
below my brethren  from under the hatches of sin battened down above
you by the evil one  thats where you came from—a walk up and down the
pulpit  and where are you going—stopping abruptly  where are you
going? aloft—very softly and pointing upward  aloft—louder
 aloft—louder still  thats where you are going—with a fair wind—all
taut and trim steering direct for heaven in its glory where there are
no storms or foul weather and where the wicked cease from troubling and
the weary are at rest—another walk  thats where youre going to my
friends  thats it  thats the place  thats the port  thats the
haven  its a blessed harbour—still water there in all changes of the
winds and tides no driving ashore upon the rocks or slipping your
cables and running out to sea there peace—peace—peace—all
peace—another walk and patting the bible under his left arm  what
these fellows are coming from the wilderness are they?  yes  from the
dreary blighted wilderness of iniquity whose only crop is death  but
do they lean upon anything—do they lean upon nothing these poor
seamen?—three raps upon the bible  oh yes—yes—they lean upon the arm
of their beloved—three more raps  upon the arm of their beloved—three
more and a walk  pilot guiding-star and compass all in one to all
hands—here it is—three more  here it is  they can do their seamans
duty manfully and be easy in their minds in the utmost peril and danger
with this—two more  they can come even these poor fellows can come
from the wilderness leaning on the arm of their beloved and go
up—up—up—raising his hand higher and higher at every repetition of
the word so that he stood with it at last stretched above his head
regarding them in a strange rapt manner and pressing the book
triumphantly to his breast until he gradually subsided into some other
portion of his discourse

i have cited this rather as an instance of the preachers eccentricities
than his merits though taken in connection with his look and manner and
the character of his audience even this was striking  it is possible
however that my favourable impression of him may have been greatly
influenced and strengthened firstly by his impressing upon his hearers
that the true observance of religion was not inconsistent with a cheerful
deportment and an exact discharge of the duties of their station which
indeed it scrupulously required of them and secondly by his cautioning
them not to set up any monopoly in paradise and its mercies  i never
heard these two points so wisely touched (if indeed i have ever heard
them touched at all) by any preacher of that kind before

having passed the time i spent in boston in making myself acquainted
with these things in settling the course i should take in my future
travels and in mixing constantly with its society i am not aware that i
have any occasion to prolong this chapter  such of its social customs as
i have not mentioned however may be told in a very few words

the usual dinner-hour is two oclock  a dinner party takes place at
five and at an evening party they seldom sup later than eleven so that
it goes hard but one gets home even from a rout by midnight  i never
could find out any difference between a party at boston and a party in
london saving that at the former place all assemblies are held at more
rational hours that the conversation may possibly be a little louder and
more cheerful and a guest is usually expected to ascend to the very top
of the house to take his cloak off that he is certain to see at every
dinner an unusual amount of poultry on the table and at every supper
at least two mighty bowls of hot stewed oysters in any one of which a
half-grown duke of clarence might be smothered easily

there are two theatres in boston of good size and construction but
sadly in want of patronage  the few ladies who resort to them sit as
of right in the front rows of the boxes

the bar is a large room with a stone floor and there people stand and
smoke and lounge about all the evening dropping in and out as the
humour takes them  there too the stranger is initiated into the
mysteries of gin-sling cock-tail sangaree mint julep sherry-cobbler
timber doodle and other rare drinks  the house is full of boarders
both married and single many of whom sleep upon the premises and
contract by the week for their board and lodging the charge for which
diminishes as they go nearer the sky to roost  a public table is laid in
a very handsome hall for breakfast and for dinner and for supper  the
party sitting down together to these meals will vary in number from one
to two hundred sometimes more  the advent of each of these epochs in
the day is proclaimed by an awful gong which shakes the very
window-frames as it reverberates through the house and horribly disturbs
nervous foreigners  there is an ordinary for ladies and an ordinary for
gentlemen

in our private room the cloth could not for any earthly consideration
have been laid for dinner without a huge glass dish of cranberries in the
middle of the table and breakfast would have been no breakfast unless
the principal dish were a deformed beef-steak with a great flat bone in
the centre swimming in hot butter and sprinkled with the very blackest
of all possible pepper  our bedroom was spacious and airy but (like
every bedroom on this side of the atlantic) very bare of furniture
having no curtains to the french bedstead or to the window  it had one
unusual luxury however in the shape of a wardrobe of painted wood
something smaller than an english watch-box or if this comparison should
be insufficient to convey a just idea of its dimensions they may be
estimated from the fact of my having lived for fourteen days and nights
in the firm belief that it was a shower-bath




chapter iv
an american railroad  lowell and its factory system


before leaving boston i devoted one day to an excursion to lowell  i
assign a separate chapter to this visit not because i am about to
describe it at any great length but because i remember it as a thing by
itself and am desirous that my readers should do the same

i made acquaintance with an american railroad on this occasion for the
first time  as these works are pretty much alike all through the states
their general characteristics are easily described

there are no first and second class carriages as with us but there is a
gentlemans car and a ladies car the main distinction between which is
that in the first everybody smokes and in the second nobody does  as
a black man never travels with a white one there is also a negro car
which is a great blundering clumsy chest such as gulliver put to sea
in from the kingdom of brobdingnag  there is a great deal of jolting a
great deal of noise a great deal of wall not much window a locomotive
engine a shriek and a bell

the cars are like shabby omnibuses but larger holding thirty forty
fifty people  the seats instead of stretching from end to end are
placed crosswise  each seat holds two persons  there is a long row of
them on each side of the caravan a narrow passage up the middle and a
door at both ends  in the centre of the carriage there is usually a
stove fed with charcoal or anthracite coal which is for the most part
red-hot  it is insufferably close and you see the hot air fluttering
between yourself and any other object you may happen to look at like the
ghost of smoke

in the ladies car there are a great many gentlemen who have ladies with
them  there are also a great many ladies who have nobody with them for
any lady may travel alone from one end of the united states to the
other and be certain of the most courteous and considerate treatment
everywhere  the conductor or check-taker or guard or whatever he may
be wears no uniform  he walks up and down the car and in and out of
it as his fancy dictates leans against the door with his hands in his
pockets and stares at you if you chance to be a stranger or enters into
conversation with the passengers about him  a great many newspapers are
pulled out and a few of them are read  everybody talks to you or to
anybody else who hits his fancy  if you are an englishman he expects
that that railroad is pretty much like an english railroad  if you say
 no he says  yes? (interrogatively) and asks in what respect they
differ  you enumerate the heads of difference one by one and he says
 yes? (still interrogatively) to each  then he guesses that you dont
travel faster in england and on your replying that you do says  yes?
again (still interrogatively) and it is quite evident dont believe it
after a long pause he remarks partly to you and partly to the knob on
the top of his stick that  yankees are reckoned to be considerable of a
go-ahead people too upon which you say  yes and then he says
 yes again (affirmatively this time) and upon your looking out of
window tells you that behind that hill and some three miles from the
next station there is a clever town in a smart lo-ca-tion where he
expects you have concluded to stop  your answer in the negative
naturally leads to more questions in reference to your intended route
(always pronounced rout) and wherever you are going you invariably
learn that you cant get there without immense difficulty and danger and
that all the great sights are somewhere else

if a lady take a fancy to any male passengers seat the gentleman who
accompanies her gives him notice of the fact and he immediately vacates
it with great politeness  politics are much discussed so are banks so
is cotton  quiet people avoid the question of the presidency for there
will be a new election in three years and a half and party feeling runs
very high the great constitutional feature of this institution being
that directly the acrimony of the last election is over the acrimony of
the next one begins which is an unspeakable comfort to all strong
politicians and true lovers of their country that is to say to
ninety-nine men and boys out of every ninety-nine and a quarter

except when a branch road joins the main one there is seldom more than
one track of rails so that the road is very narrow and the view where
there is a deep cutting by no means extensive  when there is not the
character of the scenery is always the same  mile after mile of stunted
trees some hewn down by the axe some blown down by the wind some half
fallen and resting on their neighbours many mere logs half hidden in the
swamp others mouldered away to spongy chips  the very soil of the earth
is made up of minute fragments such as these each pool of stagnant water
has its crust of vegetable rottenness on every side there are the
boughs and trunks and stumps of trees in every possible stage of
decay decomposition and neglect  now you emerge for a few brief
minutes on an open country glittering with some bright lake or pool
broad as many an english river but so small here that it scarcely has a
name now catch hasty glimpses of a distant town with its clean white
houses and their cool piazzas its prim new england church and
school-house when whir-r-r-r almost before you have seen them comes
the same dark screen the stunted trees the stumps the logs the
stagnant water—all so like the last that you seem to have been
transported back again by magic

the train calls at stations in the woods where the wild impossibility of
anybody having the smallest reason to get out is only to be equalled by
the apparently desperate hopelessness of there being anybody to get in
it rushes across the turnpike road where there is no gate no policeman
no signal nothing but a rough wooden arch on which is painted  when the
bell rings look out for the locomotive  on it whirls headlong dives
through the woods again emerges in the light clatters over frail
arches rumbles upon the heavy ground shoots beneath a wooden bridge
which intercepts the light for a second like a wink suddenly awakens all
the slumbering echoes in the main street of a large town and dashes on
haphazard pell-mell neck-or-nothing down the middle of the road
there—with mechanics working at their trades and people leaning from
their doors and windows and boys flying kites and playing marbles and
men smoking and women talking and children crawling and pigs
burrowing and unaccustomed horses plunging and rearing close to the
very rails—there—on on on—tears the mad dragon of an engine with its
train of cars scattering in all directions a shower of burning sparks
from its wood fire screeching hissing yelling panting until at last
the thirsty monster stops beneath a covered way to drink the people
cluster round and you have time to breathe again

i was met at the station at lowell by a gentleman intimately connected
with the management of the factories there and gladly putting myself
under his guidance drove off at once to that quarter of the town in
which the works the object of my visit were situated  although only
just of age—for if my recollection serve me it has been a manufacturing
town barely one-and-twenty years—lowell is a large populous thriving
place  those indications of its youth which first attract the eye give
it a quaintness and oddity of character which to a visitor from the old
country is amusing enough  it was a very dirty winters day and
nothing in the whole town looked old to me except the mud which in some
parts was almost knee-deep and might have been deposited there on the
subsiding of the waters after the deluge  in one place there was a new
wooden church which having no steeple and being yet unpainted looked
like an enormous packing-case without any direction upon it  in another
there was a large hotel whose walls and colonnades were so crisp and
thin and slight that it had exactly the appearance of being built with
cards  i was careful not to draw my breath as we passed and trembled
when i saw a workman come out upon the roof lest with one thoughtless
stamp of his foot he should crush the structure beneath him and bring it
rattling down  the very river that moves the machinery in the mills (for
they are all worked by water power) seems to acquire a new character
from the fresh buildings of bright red brick and painted wood among which
it takes its course and to be as light-headed thoughtless and brisk a
young river in its murmurings and tumblings as one would desire to see
one would swear that every  bakery  grocery and  bookbindery and
other kind of store took its shutters down for the first time and
started in business yesterday  the golden pestles and mortars fixed as
signs upon the sun-blind frames outside the druggists appear to have
been just turned out of the united states mint and when i saw a baby of
some week or ten days old in a womans arms at a street corner i found
myself unconsciously wondering where it came from never supposing for an
instant that it could have been born in such a young town as that

there are several factories in lowell each of which belongs to what we
should term a company of proprietors but what they call in america a
corporation  i went over several of these such as a woollen factory a
carpet factory and a cotton factory examined them in every part and
saw them in their ordinary working aspect with no preparation of any
kind or departure from their ordinary everyday proceedings  i may add
that i am well acquainted with our manufacturing towns in england and
have visited many mills in manchester and elsewhere in the same manner

i happened to arrive at the first factory just as the dinner hour was
over and the girls were returning to their work indeed the stairs of
the mill were thronged with them as i ascended  they were all well
dressed but not to my thinking above their condition for i like to see
the humbler classes of society careful of their dress and appearance and
even if they please decorated with such little trinkets as come within
the compass of their means  supposing it confined within reasonable
limits i would always encourage this kind of pride as a worthy element
of self-respect in any person i employed and should no more be deterred
from doing so because some wretched female referred her fall to a love
of dress than i would allow my construction of the real intent and
meaning of the sabbath to be influenced by any warning to the
well-disposed founded on his backslidings on that particular day which
might emanate from the rather doubtful authority of a murderer in
newgate

these girls as i have said were all well dressed and that phrase
necessarily includes extreme cleanliness  they had serviceable bonnets
good warm cloaks and shawls and were not above clogs and pattens
moreover there were places in the mill in which they could deposit these
things without injury and there were conveniences for washing  they
were healthy in appearance many of them remarkably so and had the
manners and deportment of young women not of degraded brutes of burden
if i had seen in one of those mills (but i did not though i looked for
something of this kind with a sharp eye) the most lisping mincing
affected and ridiculous young creature that my imagination could
suggest i should have thought of the careless moping slatternly
degraded dull reverse (i have seen that) and should have been still
well pleased to look upon her

the rooms in which they worked were as well ordered as themselves  in
the windows of some there were green plants which were trained to shade
the glass in all there was as much fresh air cleanliness and comfort
as the nature of the occupation would possibly admit of  out of so large
a number of females many of whom were only then just verging upon
womanhood it may be reasonably supposed that some were delicate and
fragile in appearance no doubt there were  but i solemnly declare that
from all the crowd i saw in the different factories that day i cannot
recall or separate one young face that gave me a painful impression not
one young girl whom assuming it to be a matter of necessity that she
should gain her daily bread by the labour of her hands i would have
removed from those works if i had had the power

they reside in various boarding-houses near at hand  the owners of the
mills are particularly careful to allow no persons to enter upon the
possession of these houses whose characters have not undergone the most
searching and thorough inquiry  any complaint that is made against them
by the boarders or by any one else is fully investigated and if good
ground of complaint be shown to exist against them they are removed and
their occupation is handed over to some more deserving person  there are
a few children employed in these factories but not many  the laws of
the state forbid their working more than nine months in the year and
require that they be educated during the other three  for this purpose
there are schools in lowell and there are churches and chapels of
various persuasions in which the young women may observe that form of
worship in which they have been educated

at some distance from the factories and on the highest and pleasantest
ground in the neighbourhood stands their hospital or boarding-house for
the sick it is the best house in those parts and was built by an
eminent merchant for his own residence  like that institution at boston
which i have before described it is not parcelled out into wards but is
divided into convenient chambers each of which has all the comforts of a
very comfortable home  the principal medical attendant resides under the
same roof and were the patients members of his own family they could
not be better cared for or attended with greater gentleness and
consideration  the weekly charge in this establishment for each female
patient is three dollars or twelve shillings english but no girl
employed by any of the corporations is ever excluded for want of the
means of payment  that they do not very often want the means may be
gathered from the fact that in july 1841 no fewer than nine hundred
and seventy-eight of these girls were depositors in the lowell savings
bank the amount of whose joint savings was estimated at one hundred
thousand dollars or twenty thousand english pounds

i am now going to state three facts which will startle a large class of
readers on this side of the atlantic very much

firstly there is a joint-stock piano in a great many of the
boarding-houses  secondly nearly all these young ladies subscribe to
circulating libraries  thirdly they have got up among themselves a
periodical called the lowell offering  a repository of original
articles written exclusively by females actively employed in the
mills—which is duly printed published and sold and whereof i brought
away from lowell four hundred good solid pages which i have read from
beginning to end

the large class of readers startled by these facts will exclaim with
one voice  how very preposterous  on my deferentially inquiring why
they will answer  these things are above their station  in reply to
that objection i would beg to ask what their station is

it is their station to work  and they do work  they labour in these
mills upon an average twelve hours a day which is unquestionably work
and pretty tight work too  perhaps it is above their station to indulge
in such amusements on any terms  are we quite sure that we in england
have not formed our ideas of the  station of working people from
accustoming ourselves to the contemplation of that class as they are and
not as they might be? i think that if we examine our own feelings we
shall find that the pianos and the circulating libraries and even the
lowell offering startle us by their novelty and not by their bearing
upon any abstract question of right or wrong

for myself i know no station in which the occupation of to-day
cheerfully done and the occupation of to-morrow cheerfully looked to any
one of these pursuits is not most humanising and laudable  i know no
station which is rendered more endurable to the person in it or more
safe to the person out of it by having ignorance for its associate  i
know no station which has a right to monopolise the means of mutual
instruction improvement and rational entertainment or which has ever
continued to be a station very long after seeking to do so

of the merits of the lowell offering as a literary production i will
only observe putting entirely out of sight the fact of the articles
having been written by these girls after the arduous labours of the day
that it will compare advantageously with a great many english annuals
it is pleasant to find that many of its tales are of the mills and of
those who work in them that they inculcate habits of self-denial and
contentment and teach good doctrines of enlarged benevolence  a strong
feeling for the beauties of nature as displayed in the solitudes the
writers have left at home breathes through its pages like wholesome
village air and though a circulating library is a favourable school for
the study of such topics it has very scant allusion to fine clothes
fine marriages fine houses or fine life  some persons might object to
the papers being signed occasionally with rather fine names but this is
an american fashion  one of the provinces of the state legislature of
massachusetts is to alter ugly names into pretty ones as the children
improve upon the tastes of their parents  these changes costing little
or nothing scores of mary annes are solemnly converted into bevelinas
every session

it is said that on the occasion of a visit from general jackson or
general harrison to this town (i forget which but it is not to the
purpose) he walked through three miles and a half of these young ladies
all dressed out with parasols and silk stockings  but as i am not aware
that any worse consequence ensued than a sudden looking-up of all the
parasols and silk stockings in the market and perhaps the bankruptcy of
some speculative new englander who bought them all up at any price in
expectation of a demand that never came i set no great store by the
circumstance

in this brief account of lowell and inadequate expression of the
gratification it yielded me and cannot fail to afford to any foreigner
to whom the condition of such people at home is a subject of interest and
anxious speculation i have carefully abstained from drawing a comparison
between these factories and those of our own land  many of the
circumstances whose strong influence has been at work for years in our
manufacturing towns have not arisen here and there is no manufacturing
population in lowell so to speak for these girls (often the daughters
of small farmers) come from other states remain a few years in the
mills and then go home for good

the contrast would be a strong one for it would be between the good and
evil the living light and deepest shadow  i abstain from it because i
deem it just to do so  but i only the more earnestly adjure all those
whose eyes may rest on these pages to pause and reflect upon the
difference between this town and those great haunts of desperate misery
to call to mind if they can in the midst of party strife and squabble
the efforts that must be made to purge them of their suffering and
danger and last and foremost to remember how the precious time is
rushing by

i returned at night by the same railroad and in the same kind of car
one of the passengers being exceedingly anxious to expound at great
length to my companion (not to me of course) the true principles on
which books of travel in america should be written by englishmen i
feigned to fall asleep  but glancing all the way out at window from the
corners of my eyes i found abundance of entertainment for the rest of
the ride in watching the effects of the wood fire which had been
invisible in the morning but were now brought out in full relief by the
darkness for we were travelling in a whirlwind of bright sparks which
showered about us like a storm of fiery snow




chapter v
worcester  the connecticut river  hartford  new haven  to new york


leaving boston on the afternoon of saturday the fifth of february we
proceeded by another railroad to worcester a pretty new england town
where we had arranged to remain under the hospitable roof of the governor
of the state until monday morning

these towns and cities of new england (many of which would be villages in
old england) are as favourable specimens of rural america as their
people are of rural americans  the well-trimmed lawns and green meadows
of home are not there and the grass compared with our ornamental plots
and pastures is rank and rough and wild but delicate slopes of land
gently-swelling hills wooded valleys and slender streams abound
every little colony of houses has its church and school-house peeping
from among the white roofs and shady trees every house is the whitest of
the white every venetian blind the greenest of the green every fine
days sky the bluest of the blue  a sharp dry wind and a slight frost
had so hardened the roads when we alighted at worcester that their
furrowed tracks were like ridges of granite  there was the usual aspect
of newness on every object of course  all the buildings looked as if
they had been built and painted that morning and could be taken down on
monday with very little trouble  in the keen evening air every sharp
outline looked a hundred times sharper than ever  the clean cardboard
colonnades had no more perspective than a chinese bridge on a tea-cup
and appeared equally well calculated for use  the razor-like edges of
the detached cottages seemed to cut the very wind as it whistled against
them and to send it smarting on its way with a shriller cry than before
those slightly-built wooden dwellings behind which the sun was setting
with a brilliant lustre could be so looked through and through that the
idea of any inhabitant being able to hide himself from the public gaze
or to have any secrets from the public eye was not entertainable for a
moment  even where a blazing fire shone through the uncurtained windows
of some distant house it had the air of being newly lighted and of
lacking warmth and instead of awakening thoughts of a snug chamber
bright with faces that first saw the light round that same hearth and
ruddy with warm hangings it came upon one suggestive of the smell of new
mortar and damp walls

so i thought at least that evening  next morning when the sun was
shining brightly and the clear church bells were ringing and sedate
people in their best clothes enlivened the pathway near at hand and
dotted the distant thread of road there was a pleasant sabbath
peacefulness on everything which it was good to feel  it would have
been the better for an old church better still for some old graves but
as it was a wholesome repose and tranquillity pervaded the scene which
after the restless ocean and the hurried city had a doubly grateful
influence on the spirits

we went on next morning still by railroad to springfield  from that
place to hartford whither we were bound is a distance of only
five-and-twenty miles but at that time of the year the roads were so bad
that the journey would probably have occupied ten or twelve hours
fortunately however the winter having been unusually mild the
connecticut river was  open or in other words not frozen  the
captain of a small steamboat was going to make his first trip for the
season that day (the second february trip i believe within the memory
of man) and only waited for us to go on board  accordingly we went on
board with as little delay as might be  he was as good as his word and
started directly

it certainly was not called a small steamboat without reason  i omitted
to ask the question but i should think it must have been of about half a
pony power  mr paap the celebrated dwarf might have lived and died
happily in the cabin which was fitted with common sash-windows like an
ordinary dwelling-house  these windows had bright-red curtains too
hung on slack strings across the lower panes so that it looked like the
parlour of a lilliputian public-house which had got afloat in a flood or
some other water accident and was drifting nobody knew where  but even
in this chamber there was a rocking-chair  it would be impossible to get
on anywhere in america without a rocking-chair  i am afraid to tell
how many feet short this vessel was or how many feet narrow to apply
the words length and width to such measurement would be a contradiction
in terms  but i may state that we all kept the middle of the deck lest
the boat should unexpectedly tip over and that the machinery by some
surprising process of condensation worked between it and the keel the
whole forming a warm sandwich about three feet thick

it rained all day as i once thought it never did rain anywhere but in
the highlands of scotland  the river was full of floating blocks of ice
which were constantly crunching and cracking under us and the depth of
water in the course we took to avoid the larger masses carried down the
middle of the river by the current did not exceed a few inches
nevertheless we moved onward dexterously and being well wrapped up
bade defiance to the weather and enjoyed the journey  the connecticut
river is a fine stream and the banks in summer-time are i have no
doubt beautiful at all events i was told so by a young lady in the
cabin and she should be a judge of beauty if the possession of a
quality include the appreciation of it for a more beautiful creature i
never looked upon

after two hours and a half of this odd travelling (including a stoppage
at a small town where we were saluted by a gun considerably bigger than
our own chimney) we reached hartford and straightway repaired to an
extremely comfortable hotel except as usual in the article of
bedrooms which in almost every place we visited were very conducive to
early rising

we tarried here four days  the town is beautifully situated in a basin
of green hills the soil is rich well-wooded and carefully improved
it is the seat of the local legislature of connecticut which sage body
enacted in bygone times the renowned code of  blue laws in virtue
whereof among other enlightened provisions any citizen who could be
proved to have kissed his wife on sunday was punishable i believe with
the stocks  too much of the old puritan spirit exists in these parts to
the present hour but its influence has not tended that i know to make
the people less hard in their bargains or more equal in their dealings
as i never heard of its working that effect anywhere else i infer that
it never will here  indeed i am accustomed with reference to great
professions and severe faces to judge of the goods of the other world
pretty much as i judge of the goods of this and whenever i see a dealer
in such commodities with too great a display of them in his window i
doubt the quality of the article within

in hartford stands the famous oak in which the charter of king charles
was hidden  it is now inclosed in a gentlemans garden  in the state
house is the charter itself  i found the courts of law here just the
same as at boston the public institutions almost as good  the insane
asylum is admirably conducted and so is the institution for the deaf and
dumb

i very much questioned within myself as i walked through the insane
asylum whether i should have known the attendants from the patients but
for the few words which passed between the former and the doctor in
reference to the persons under their charge  of course i limit this
remark merely to their looks for the conversation of the mad people was
mad enough

there was one little prim old lady of very smiling and good-humoured
appearance who came sidling up to me from the end of a long passage and
with a curtsey of inexpressible condescension propounded this
unaccountable inquiry

 does pontefract still flourish sir upon the soil of england?

 he does maam i rejoined

 when you last saw him sir he was—

 well maam said i  extremely well  he begged me to present his
compliments  i never saw him looking better

at this the old lady was very much delighted  after glancing at me for
a moment as if to be quite sure that i was serious in my respectful air
she sidled back some paces sidled forward again made a sudden skip (at
which i precipitately retreated a step or two) and said

 i am an antediluvian sir

i thought the best thing to say was that i had suspected as much from
the first  therefore i said so

 it is an extremely proud and pleasant thing sir to be an
antediluvian said the old lady

 i should think it was maam i rejoined

the old lady kissed her hand gave another skip smirked and sidled down
the gallery in a most extraordinary manner and ambled gracefully into
her own bed-chamber

in another part of the building there was a male patient in bed very
much flushed and heated

 well said he starting up and pulling off his night-cap  its all
settled at last  i have arranged it with queen victoria

 arranged what? asked the doctor

 why that business passing his hand wearily across his forehead
 about the siege of new york

 oh said i like a man suddenly enlightened  for he looked at me for
an answer

 yes  every house without a signal will be fired upon by the british
troops  no harm will be done to the others  no harm at all  those that
want to be safe must hoist flags  thats all theyll have to do  they
must hoist flags

even while he was speaking he seemed i thought to have some faint idea
that his talk was incoherent  directly he had said these words he lay
down again gave a kind of a groan and covered his hot head with the
blankets

there was another a young man whose madness was love and music  after
playing on the accordion a march he had composed he was very anxious
that i should walk into his chamber which i immediately did

by way of being very knowing and humouring him to the top of his bent i
went to the window which commanded a beautiful prospect and remarked
with an address upon which i greatly plumed myself

 what a delicious country you have about these lodgings of yours

 poh said he moving his fingers carelessly over the notes of his
instrument  well enough for such an institution as this

i dont think i was ever so taken aback in all my life

 i come here just for a whim he said coolly   thats all

 oh  thats all said i

 yes  thats all  the doctors a smart man  he quite enters into it
its a joke of mine  i like it for a time  you neednt mention it but
i think i shall go out next tuesday

i assured him that i would consider our interview perfectly confidential
and rejoined the doctor  as we were passing through a gallery on our way
out a well-dressed lady of quiet and composed manners came up and
proffering a slip of paper and a pen begged that i would oblige her with
an autograph i complied and we parted

 i think i remember having had a few interviews like that with ladies
out of doors  i hope she is not mad?

 yes

 on what subject?  autographs?

 no  she hears voices in the air

 well thought i  it would be well if we could shut up a few false
prophets of these later times who have professed to do the same and i
should like to try the experiment on a mormonist or two to begin with

in this place there is the best jail for untried offenders in the world
there is also a very well-ordered state prison arranged upon the same
plan as that at boston except that here there is always a sentry on the
wall with a loaded gun  it contained at that time about two hundred
prisoners  a spot was shown me in the sleeping ward where a watchman
was murdered some years since in the dead of night in a desperate
attempt to escape made by a prisoner who had broken from his cell  a
woman too was pointed out to me who for the murder of her husband
had been a close prisoner for sixteen years

 do you think i asked of my conductor  that after so very long an
imprisonment she has any thought or hope of ever regaining her liberty?

 oh dear yes he answered   to be sure she has

 she has no chance of obtaining it i suppose?

 well i dont know which by-the-bye is a national answer  her
friends mistrust her

 what have they to do with it? i naturally inquired

 well they wont petition

 but if they did they couldnt get her out i suppose?

 well not the first time perhaps nor yet the second but tiring and
wearying for a few years might do it

 does that ever do it?

 why yes thatll do it sometimes  political friendsll do it sometimes
its pretty often done one way or another

i shall always entertain a very pleasant and grateful recollection of
hartford  it is a lovely place and i had many friends there whom i can
never remember with indifference  we left it with no little regret on
the evening of friday the 11th and travelled that night by railroad to
new haven  upon the way the guard and i were formally introduced to
each other (as we usually were on such occasions) and exchanged a
variety of small-talk  we reached new haven at about eight oclock
after a journey of three hours and put up for the night at the best inn

new haven known also as the city of elms is a fine town  many of its
streets (as its alias sufficiently imports) are planted with rows of
grand old elm-trees and the same natural ornaments surround yale
college an establishment of considerable eminence and reputation  the
various departments of this institution are erected in a kind of park or
common in the middle of the town where they are dimly visible among the
shadowing trees  the effect is very like that of an old cathedral yard
in england and when their branches are in full leaf must be extremely
picturesque  even in the winter time these groups of well-grown trees
clustering among the busy streets and houses of a thriving city have a
very quaint appearance seeming to bring about a kind of compromise
between town and country as if each had met the other half-way and
shaken hands upon it which is at once novel and pleasant

after a nights rest we rose early and in good time went down to the
wharf and on board the packet new york for new york  this was the
first american steamboat of any size that i had seen and certainly to an
english eye it was infinitely less like a steamboat than a huge floating
bath  i could hardly persuade myself indeed but that the bathing
establishment off westminster bridge which i left a baby had suddenly
grown to an enormous size run away from home and set up in foreign
parts as a steamer  being in america too which our vagabonds do so
particularly favour it seemed the more probable

the great difference in appearance between these packets and ours is
that there is so much of them out of the water the main-deck being
enclosed on all sides and filled with casks and goods like any second
or third floor in a stack of warehouses and the promenade or
hurricane-deck being a-top of that again  a part of the machinery is
always above this deck where the connecting-rod in a strong and lofty
frame is seen working away like an iron top-sawyer  there is seldom any
mast or tackle nothing aloft but two tall black chimneys  the man at
the helm is shut up in a little house in the fore part of the boat (the
wheel being connected with the rudder by iron chains working the whole
length of the deck) and the passengers unless the weather be very fine
indeed usually congregate below  directly you have left the wharf all
the life and stir and bustle of a packet cease  you wonder for a long
time how she goes on for there seems to be nobody in charge of her and
when another of these dull machines comes splashing by you feel quite
indignant with it as a sullen cumbrous ungraceful unshiplike
leviathan quite forgetting that the vessel you are on board of is its
very counterpart

there is always a clerks office on the lower deck where you pay your
fare a ladies cabin baggage and stowage rooms engineers room and in
short a great variety of perplexities which render the discovery of the
gentlemens cabin a matter of some difficulty  it often occupies the
whole length of the boat (as it did in this case) and has three or four
tiers of berths on each side  when i first descended into the cabin of
the new york it looked in my unaccustomed eyes about as long as the
burlington arcade

the sound which has to be crossed on this passage is not always a very
safe or pleasant navigation and has been the scene of some unfortunate
accidents  it was a wet morning and very misty and we soon lost sight
of land  the day was calm however and brightened towards noon  after
exhausting (with good help from a friend) the larder and the stock of
bottled beer i lay down to sleep being very much tired with the
fatigues of yesterday  but i woke from my nap in time to hurry up and
see hell gate the hogs back the frying pan and other notorious
localities attractive to all readers of famous diedrich knickerbockers
history  we were now in a narrow channel with sloping banks on either
side besprinkled with pleasant villas and made refreshing to the sight
by turf and trees  soon we shot in quick succession past a light-house
a madhouse (how the lunatics flung up their caps and roared in sympathy
with the headlong engine and the driving tide) a jail and other
buildings and so emerged into a noble bay whose waters sparkled in the
now cloudless sunshine like natures eyes turned up to heaven

then there lay stretched out before us to the right confused heaps of
buildings with here and there a spire or steeple looking down upon the
herd below and here and there again a cloud of lazy smoke and in the
foreground a forest of ships masts cheery with flapping sails and
waving flags  crossing from among them to the opposite shore were steam
ferry-boats laden with people coaches horses waggons baskets boxes
crossed and recrossed by other ferry-boats all travelling to and fro
and never idle  stately among these restless insects were two or three
large ships moving with slow majestic pace as creatures of a prouder
kind disdainful of their puny journeys and making for the broad sea
beyond were shining heights and islands in the glancing river and a
distance scarcely less blue and bright than the sky it seemed to meet
the citys hum and buzz the clinking of capstans the ringing of bells
the barking of dogs the clattering of wheels tingled in the listening
ear  all of which life and stir coming across the stirring water
caught new life and animation from its free companionship and
sympathising with its buoyant spirits glistened as it seemed in sport
upon its surface and hemmed the vessel round and plashed the water high
about her sides and floating her gallantly into the dock flew off
again to welcome other comers and speed before them to the busy port




chapter vi
new york


the beautiful metropolis of america is by no means so clean a city as
boston but many of its streets have the same characteristics except
that the houses are not quite so fresh-coloured the sign-boards are not
quite so gaudy the gilded letters not quite so golden the bricks not
quite so red the stone not quite so white the blinds and area railings
not quite so green the knobs and plates upon the street doors not quite
so bright and twinkling  there are many by-streets almost as neutral in
clean colours and positive in dirty ones as by-streets in london and
there is one quarter commonly called the five points which in respect
of filth and wretchedness may be safely backed against seven dials or
any other part of famed st giless

the great promenade and thoroughfare as most people know is broadway a
wide and bustling street which from the battery gardens to its opposite
termination in a country road may be four miles long  shall we sit down
in an upper floor of the carlton house hotel (situated in the best part
of this main artery of new york) and when we are tired of looking down
upon the life below sally forth arm-in-arm and mingle with the stream?

warm weather  the sun strikes upon our heads at this open window as
though its rays were concentrated through a burning-glass but the day is
in its zenith and the season an unusual one  was there ever such a
sunny street as this broadway  the pavement stones are polished with the
tread of feet until they shine again the red bricks of the houses might
be yet in the dry hot kilns and the roofs of those omnibuses look as
though if water were poured on them they would hiss and smoke and
smell like half-quenched fires  no stint of omnibuses here
half-a-dozen have gone by within as many minutes  plenty of hackney cabs
and coaches too gigs phaetons large-wheeled tilburies and private
carriages—rather of a clumsy make and not very different from the public
vehicles but built for the heavy roads beyond the city pavement  negro
coachmen and white in straw hats black hats white hats glazed caps
fur caps in coats of drab black brown green blue nankeen striped
jean and linen and there in that one instance (look while it passes or
it will be too late) in suits of livery  some southern republican that
who puts his blacks in uniform and swells with sultan pomp and power
yonder where that phaeton with the well-clipped pair of grays has
stopped—standing at their heads now—is a yorkshire groom who has not
been very long in these parts and looks sorrowfully round for a
companion pair of top-boots which he may traverse the city half a year
without meeting  heaven save the ladies how they dress  we have seen
more colours in these ten minutes than we should have seen elsewhere in
as many days  what various parasols what rainbow silks and satins what
pinking of thin stockings and pinching of thin shoes and fluttering of
ribbons and silk tassels and display of rich cloaks with gaudy hoods and
linings  the young gentlemen are fond you see of turning down their
shirt-collars and cultivating their whiskers especially under the chin
but they cannot approach the ladies in their dress or bearing being to
say the truth humanity of quite another sort  byrons of the desk and
counter pass on and let us see what kind of men those are behind ye
those two labourers in holiday clothes of whom one carries in his hand a
crumpled scrap of paper from which he tries to spell out a hard name
while the other looks about for it on all the doors and windows

irishmen both  you might know them if they were masked by their
long-tailed blue coats and bright buttons and their drab trousers which
they wear like men well used to working dresses who are easy in no
others  it would be hard to keep your model republics going without the
countrymen and countrywomen of those two labourers  for who else would
dig and delve and drudge and do domestic work and make canals and
roads and execute great lines of internal improvement  irishmen both
and sorely puzzled too to find out what they seek  let us go down and
help them for the love of home and that spirit of liberty which admits
of honest service to honest men and honest work for honest bread no
matter what it be

thats well  we have got at the right address at last though it is
written in strange characters truly and might have been scrawled with
the blunt handle of the spade the writer better knows the use of than a
pen  their way lies yonder but what business takes them there?  they
carry savings to hoard up?  no  they are brothers those men  one
crossed the sea alone and working very hard for one half year and
living harder saved funds enough to bring the other out  that done
they worked together side by side contentedly sharing hard labour and
hard living for another term and then their sisters came and then
another brother and lastly their old mother  and what now?  why the
poor old crone is restless in a strange land and yearns to lay her
bones she says among her people in the old graveyard at home and so
they go to pay her passage back and god help her and them and every
simple heart and all who turn to the jerusalem of their younger days
and have an altar-fire upon the cold hearth of their fathers

this narrow thoroughfare baking and blistering in the sun is wall
street the stock exchange and lombard street of new york  many a rapid
fortune has been made in this street and many a no less rapid ruin
some of these very merchants whom you see hanging about here now have
locked up money in their strong-boxes like the man in the arabian
nights and opening them again have found but withered leaves  below
here by the water-side where the bowsprits of ships stretch across the
footway and almost thrust themselves into the windows lie the noble
american vessels which have made their packet service the finest in the
world  they have brought hither the foreigners who abound in all the
streets not perhaps that there are more here than in other commercial
cities but elsewhere they have particular haunts and you must find
them out here they pervade the town

we must cross broadway again gaining some refreshment from the heat in
the sight of the great blocks of clean ice which are being carried into
shops and bar-rooms and the pine-apples and water-melons profusely
displayed for sale  fine streets of spacious houses here you see—wall
street has furnished and dismantled many of them very often—and here a
deep green leafy square  be sure that is a hospitable house with inmates
to be affectionately remembered always where they have the open door and
pretty show of plants within and where the child with laughing eyes is
peeping out of window at the little dog below  you wonder what may be
the use of this tall flagstaff in the by-street with something like
libertys head-dress on its top so do i  but there is a passion for
tall flagstaffs hereabout and you may see its twin brother in five
minutes if you have a mind

again across broadway and so—passing from the many-coloured crowd and
glittering shops—into another long main street the bowery  a railroad
yonder see where two stout horses trot along drawing a score or two of
people and a great wooden ark with ease  the stores are poorer here
the passengers less gay  clothes ready-made and meat ready-cooked are
to be bought in these parts and the lively whirl of carriages is
exchanged for the deep rumble of carts and waggons  these signs which
are so plentiful in shape like river buoys or small balloons hoisted
by cords to poles and dangling there announce as you may see by
looking up  oysters in every style  they tempt the hungry most at
night for then dull candles glimmering inside illuminate these dainty
words and make the mouths of idlers water as they read and linger

what is this dismal-fronted pile of bastard egyptian like an enchanters
palace in a melodrama—a famous prison called the tombs  shall we go
in?

so  a long narrow lofty building stove-heated as usual with four
galleries one above the other going round it and communicating by
stairs  between the two sides of each gallery and in its centre a
bridge for the greater convenience of crossing  on each of these
bridges sits a man dozing or reading or talking to an idle companion
on each tier are two opposite rows of small iron doors  they look like
furnace-doors but are cold and black as though the fires within had all
gone out  some two or three are open and women with drooping heads
bent down are talking to the inmates  the whole is lighted by a
skylight but it is fast closed and from the roof there dangle limp and
drooping two useless windsails

a man with keys appears to show us round  a good-looking fellow and
in his way civil and obliging

 are those black doors the cells?

 yes

 are they all full?

 well theyre pretty nigh full and thats a fact and no two ways about
it

 those at the bottom are unwholesome surely?

 why we do only put coloured people in em  thats the truth

 when do the prisoners take exercise?

 well they do without it pretty much

 do they never walk in the yard?

 considerable seldom

 sometimes i suppose?

 well its rare they do  they keep pretty bright without it

 but suppose a man were here for a twelvemonth  i know this is only a
prison for criminals who are charged with grave offences while they are
awaiting their trial or under remand but the law here affords criminals
many means of delay  what with motions for new trials and in arrest of
judgment and what not a prisoner might be here for twelve months i
take it might he not?

 well i guess he might

 do you mean to say that in all that time he would never come out at that
little iron door for exercise?

 he might walk some perhaps—not much

 will you open one of the doors?

 all if you like

the fastenings jar and rattle and one of the doors turns slowly on its
hinges  let us look in  a small bare cell into which the light enters
through a high chink in the wall  there is a rude means of washing a
table and a bedstead  upon the latter sits a man of sixty reading
he looks up for a moment gives an impatient dogged shake and fixes his
eyes upon his book again  as we withdraw our heads the door closes on
him and is fastened as before  this man has murdered his wife and will
probably be hanged

 how long has he been here?

 a month

 when will he be tried?

 next term

 when is that?

 next month

 in england if a man be under sentence of death even he has air and
exercise at certain periods of the day

 possible?

with what stupendous and untranslatable coolness he says this and how
loungingly he leads on to the womens side making as he goes a kind of
iron castanet of the key and the stair-rail

each cell door on this side has a square aperture in it  some of the
women peep anxiously through it at the sound of footsteps others shrink
away in shame—for what offence can that lonely child of ten or twelve
years old be shut up here?  oh that boy? he is the son of the prisoner
we saw just now is a witness against his father and is detained here
for safe keeping until the trial thats all

but it is a dreadful place for the child to pass the long days and nights
in  this is rather hard treatment for a young witness is it not?—what
says our conductor?

 well it ant a very rowdy life and thats a fact

again he clinks his metal castanet and leads us leisurely away  i have
a question to ask him as we go

 pray why do they call this place the tombs?

 well its the cant name

 i know it is  why?

 some suicides happened here when it was first built  i expect it come
about from that

 i saw just now that that mans clothes were scattered about the floor
of his cell  dont you oblige the prisoners to be orderly and put such
things away?

 where should they put em?

 not on the ground surely  what do you say to hanging them up?

he stops and looks round to emphasise his answer

 why i say thats just it  when they had hooks they would hang
themselves so theyre taken out of every cell and theres only the
marks left where they used to be

the prison-yard in which he pauses now has been the scene of terrible
performances  into this narrow grave-like place men are brought out to
die  the wretched creature stands beneath the gibbet on the ground the
rope about his neck and when the sign is given a weight at its other
end comes running down and swings him up into the air—a corpse

the law requires that there be present at this dismal spectacle the
judge the jury and citizens to the amount of twenty-five  from the
community it is hidden  to the dissolute and bad the thing remains a
frightful mystery  between the criminal and them the prison-wall is
interposed as a thick gloomy veil  it is the curtain to his bed of
death his winding-sheet and grave  from him it shuts out life and all
the motives to unrepenting hardihood in that last hour which its mere
sight and presence is often all-sufficient to sustain  there are no bold
eyes to make him bold no ruffians to uphold a ruffians name before
all beyond the pitiless stone wall is unknown space

let us go forth again into the cheerful streets

once more in broadway  here are the same ladies in bright colours
walking to and fro in pairs and singly yonder the very same light blue
parasol which passed and repassed the hotel-window twenty times while we
were sitting there  we are going to cross here  take care of the pigs
two portly sows are trotting up behind this carriage and a select party
of half-a-dozen gentlemen hogs have just now turned the corner

here is a solitary swine lounging homeward by himself  he has only one
ear having parted with the other to vagrant-dogs in the course of his
city rambles  but he gets on very well without it and leads a roving
gentlemanly vagabond kind of life somewhat answering to that of our
club-men at home  he leaves his lodgings every morning at a certain
hour throws himself upon the town gets through his day in some manner
quite satisfactory to himself and regularly appears at the door of his
own house again at night like the mysterious master of gil blas  he is
a free-and-easy careless indifferent kind of pig having a very large
acquaintance among other pigs of the same character whom he rather knows
by sight than conversation as he seldom troubles himself to stop and
exchange civilities but goes grunting down the kennel turning up the
news and small-talk of the city in the shape of cabbage-stalks and offal
and bearing no tails but his own which is a very short one for his old
enemies the dogs have been at that too and have left him hardly enough
to swear by  he is in every respect a republican pig going wherever he
pleases and mingling with the best society on an equal if not superior
footing for every one makes way when he appears and the haughtiest give
him the wall if he prefer it  he is a great philosopher and seldom
moved unless by the dogs before mentioned  sometimes indeed you may
see his small eye twinkling on a slaughtered friend whose carcase
garnishes a butchers door-post but he grunts out  such is life all
flesh is pork buries his nose in the mire again and waddles down the
gutter comforting himself with the reflection that there is one snout
the less to anticipate stray cabbage-stalks at any rate

they are the city scavengers these pigs  ugly brutes they are having
for the most part scanty brown backs like the lids of old horsehair
trunks spotted with unwholesome black blotches  they have long gaunt
legs too and such peaked snouts that if one of them could be persuaded
to sit for his profile nobody would recognise it for a pigs likeness
they are never attended upon or fed or driven or caught but are
thrown upon their own resources in early life and become preternaturally
knowing in consequence  every pig knows where he lives much better than
anybody could tell him  at this hour just as evening is closing in you
will see them roaming towards bed by scores eating their way to the
last  occasionally some youth among them who has over-eaten himself or
has been worried by dogs trots shrinkingly homeward like a prodigal
son but this is a rare case perfect self-possession and self-reliance
and immovable composure being their foremost attributes

the streets and shops are lighted now and as the eye travels down the
long thoroughfare dotted with bright jets of gas it is reminded of
oxford street or piccadilly  here and there a flight of broad stone
cellar-steps appears and a painted lamp directs you to the bowling
saloon or ten-pin alley ten-pins being a game of mingled chance and
skill invented when the legislature passed an act forbidding nine-pins
at other downward flights of steps are other lamps marking the
whereabouts of oyster-cellars—pleasant retreats say i not only by
reason of their wonderful cookery of oysters pretty nigh as large as
cheese-plates (or for thy dear sake heartiest of greek professors) but
because of all kinds of caters of fish or flesh or fowl in these
latitudes the swallowers of oysters alone are not gregarious but
subduing themselves as it were to the nature of what they work in and
copying the coyness of the thing they eat do sit apart in curtained
boxes and consort by twos not by two hundreds

but how quiet the streets are  are there no itinerant bands no wind or
stringed instruments?  no not one  by day are there no punches
fantoccini dancing-dogs jugglers conjurers orchestrinas or even
barrel-organs?  no not one  yes i remember one  one barrel-organ and
a dancing-monkey—sportive by nature but fast fading into a dull lumpish
monkey of the utilitarian school  beyond that nothing lively no not
so much as a white mouse in a twirling cage

are there no amusements?  yes  there is a lecture-room across the way
from which that glare of light proceeds and there may be evening service
for the ladies thrice a week or oftener  for the young gentlemen there
is the counting-house the store the bar-room the latter as you may
see through these windows pretty full  hark to the clinking sound of
hammers breaking lumps of ice and to the cool gurgling of the pounded
bits as in the process of mixing they are poured from glass to glass
no amusements?  what are these suckers of cigars and swallowers of strong
drinks whose hats and legs we see in every possible variety of twist
doing but amusing themselves?  what are the fifty newspapers which
those precocious urchins are bawling down the street and which are kept
filed within what are they but amusements?  not vapid waterish
amusements but good strong stuff dealing in round abuse and blackguard
names pulling off the roofs of private houses as the halting devil did
in spain pimping and pandering for all degrees of vicious taste and
gorging with coined lies the most voracious maw imputing to every man in
public life the coarsest and the vilest motives scaring away from the
stabbed and prostrate body-politic every samaritan of clear conscience
and good deeds and setting on with yell and whistle and the clapping of
foul hands the vilest vermin and worst birds of prey—no amusements

let us go on again and passing this wilderness of an hotel with stores
about its base like some continental theatre or the london opera house
shorn of its colonnade plunge into the five points  but it is needful
first that we take as our escort these two heads of the police whom you
would know for sharp and well-trained officers if you met them in the
great desert  so true it is that certain pursuits wherever carried on
will stamp men with the same character  these two might have been
begotten born and bred in bow street

we have seen no beggars in the streets by night or day but of other
kinds of strollers plenty  poverty wretchedness and vice are rife
enough where we are going now

this is the place these narrow ways diverging to the right and left
and reeking everywhere with dirt and filth  such lives as are led here
bear the same fruits here as elsewhere  the coarse and bloated faces at
the doors have counterparts at home and all the wide world over
debauchery has made the very houses prematurely old  see how the rotten
beams are tumbling down and how the patched and broken windows seem to
scowl dimly like eyes that have been hurt in drunken frays  many of
those pigs live here  do they ever wonder why their masters walk upright
in lieu of going on all-fours? and why they talk instead of grunting?

so far nearly every house is a low tavern and on the bar-room walls
are coloured prints of washington and queen victoria of england and the
american eagle  among the pigeon-holes that hold the bottles are pieces
of plate-glass and coloured paper for there is in some sort a taste
for decoration even here  and as seamen frequent these haunts there
are maritime pictures by the dozen of partings between sailors and their
lady-loves portraits of william of the ballad and his black-eyed
susan of will watch the bold smuggler of paul jones the pirate and
the like on which the painted eyes of queen victoria and of washington
to boot rest in as strange companionship as on most of the scenes that
are enacted in their wondering presence

what place is this to which the squalid street conducts us?  a kind of
square of leprous houses some of which are attainable only by crazy
wooden stairs without  what lies beyond this tottering flight of steps
that creak beneath our tread?—a miserable room lighted by one dim
candle and destitute of all comfort save that which may be hidden in a
wretched bed  beside it sits a man his elbows on his knees his
forehead hidden in his hands   what ails that man? asks the foremost
officer   fever he sullenly replies without looking up  conceive the
fancies of a feverish brain in such a place as this

ascend these pitch-dark stairs heedful of a false footing on the
trembling boards and grope your way with me into this wolfish den where
neither ray of light nor breath of air appears to come  a negro lad
startled from his sleep by the officers voice—he knows it well—but
comforted by his assurance that he has not come on business officiously
bestirs himself to light a candle  the match flickers for a moment and
shows great mounds of dusty rags upon the ground then dies away and
leaves a denser darkness than before if there can be degrees in such
extremes  he stumbles down the stairs and presently comes back shading
a flaring taper with his hand  then the mounds of rags are seen to be
astir and rise slowly up and the floor is covered with heaps of negro
women waking from their sleep their white teeth chattering and their
bright eyes glistening and winking on all sides with surprise and fear
like the countless repetition of one astonished african face in some
strange mirror

mount up these other stairs with no less caution (there are traps and
pitfalls here for those who are not so well escorted as ourselves) into
the housetop where the bare beams and rafters meet overhead and calm
night looks down through the crevices in the roof  open the door of one
of these cramped hutches full of sleeping negroes  pah  they have a
charcoal fire within there is a smell of singeing clothes or flesh so
close they gather round the brazier and vapours issue forth that blind
and suffocate  from every corner as you glance about you in these dark
retreats some figure crawls half-awakened as if the judgment-hour were
near at hand and every obscene grave were giving up its dead  where
dogs would howl to lie women and men and boys slink off to sleep
forcing the dislodged rats to move away in quest of better lodgings

here too are lanes and alleys paved with mud knee-deep underground
chambers where they dance and game the walls bedecked with rough
designs of ships and forts and flags and american eagles out of
number ruined houses open to the street whence through wide gaps in
the walls other ruins loom upon the eye as though the world of vice and
misery had nothing else to show hideous tenements which take their name
from robbery and murder all that is loathsome drooping and decayed is
here

our leader has his hand upon the latch of  almacks and calls to us
from the bottom of the steps for the assembly-room of the five point
fashionables is approached by a descent  shall we go in?  it is but a
moment

heyday the landlady of almacks thrives  a buxom fat mulatto woman
with sparkling eyes whose head is daintily ornamented with a
handkerchief of many colours  nor is the landlord much behind her in his
finery being attired in a smart blue jacket like a ships steward with
a thick gold ring upon his little finger and round his neck a gleaming
golden watch-guard  how glad he is to see us  what will we please to
call for?  a dance?  it shall be done directly sir  a regular
break-down

the corpulent black fiddler and his friend who plays the tambourine
stamp upon the boarding of the small raised orchestra in which they sit
and play a lively measure  five or six couple come upon the floor
marshalled by a lively young negro who is the wit of the assembly and
the greatest dancer known  he never leaves off making queer faces and
is the delight of all the rest who grin from ear to ear incessantly
among the dancers are two young mulatto girls with large black
drooping eyes and head-gear after the fashion of the hostess who are as
shy or feign to be as though they never danced before and so look down
before the visitors that their partners can see nothing but the long
fringed lashes

but the dance commences  every gentleman sets as long as he likes to the
opposite lady and the opposite lady to him and all are so long about it
that the sport begins to languish when suddenly the lively hero dashes
in to the rescue  instantly the fiddler grins and goes at it tooth and
nail there is new energy in the tambourine new laughter in the dancers
new smiles in the landlady new confidence in the landlord new
brightness in the very candles

single shuffle double shuffle cut and cross-cut snapping his fingers
rolling his eyes turning in his knees presenting the backs of his legs
in front spinning about on his toes and heels like nothing but the mans
fingers on the tambourine dancing with two left legs two right legs
two wooden legs two wire legs two spring legs—all sorts of legs and no
legs—what is this to him? and in what walk of life or dance of life
does man ever get such stimulating applause as thunders about him when
having danced his partner off her feet and himself too he finishes by
leaping gloriously on the bar-counter and calling for something to
drink with the chuckle of a million of counterfeit jim crows in one
inimitable sound

the air even in these distempered parts is fresh after the stifling
atmosphere of the houses and now as we emerge into a broader street it
blows upon us with a purer breath and the stars look bright again  here
are the tombs once more  the city watch-house is a part of the building
it follows naturally on the sights we have just left  let us see that
and then to bed

what do you thrust your common offenders against the police discipline
of the town into such holes as these?  do men and women against whom no
crime is proved lie here all night in perfect darkness surrounded by
the noisome vapours which encircle that flagging lamp you light us with
and breathing this filthy and offensive stench  why such indecent and
disgusting dungeons as these cells would bring disgrace upon the most
despotic empire in the world  look at them man—you who see them every
night and keep the keys  do you see what they are?  do you know how
drains are made below the streets and wherein these human sewers differ
except in being always stagnant?

well he dont know  he has had five-and-twenty young women locked up in
this very cell at one time and youd hardly realise what handsome faces
there were among em

in gods name shut the door upon the wretched creature who is in it now
and put its screen before a place quite unsurpassed in all the vice
neglect and devilry of the worst old town in europe

are people really left all night untried in those black sties?—every
night  the watch is set at seven in the evening  the magistrate opens
his court at five in the morning  that is the earliest hour at which the
first prisoner can be released and if an officer appear against him he
is not taken out till nine oclock or ten—but if any one among them die
in the interval as one man did not long ago?  then he is half-eaten by
the rats in an hours time as that man was and there an end

what is this intolerable tolling of great bells and crashing of wheels
and shouting in the distance?  a fire  and what that deep red light in
the opposite direction?  another fire  and what these charred and
blackened walls we stand before?  a dwelling where a fire has been  it
was more than hinted in an official report not long ago that some of
these conflagrations were not wholly accidental and that speculation and
enterprise found a field of exertion even in flames but be this as it
may there was a fire last night there are two to-night and you may lay
an even wager there will be at least one to-morrow  so carrying that
with us for our comfort let us say good night and climb up-stairs to
bed

                                * * * * *

one day during my stay in new york i paid a visit to the different
public institutions on long island or rhode island i forget which  one
of them is a lunatic asylum  the building is handsome and is remarkable
for a spacious and elegant staircase  the whole structure is not yet
finished but it is already one of considerable size and extent and is
capable of accommodating a very large number of patients

i cannot say that i derived much comfort from the inspection of this
charity  the different wards might have been cleaner and better ordered
i saw nothing of that salutary system which had impressed me so
favourably elsewhere and everything had a lounging listless madhouse
air which was very painful  the moping idiot cowering down with long
dishevelled hair the gibbering maniac with his hideous laugh and
pointed finger the vacant eye the fierce wild face the gloomy picking
of the hands and lips and munching of the nails there they were all
without disguise in naked ugliness and horror  in the dining-room a
bare dull dreary place with nothing for the eye to rest on but the
empty walls a woman was locked up alone  she was bent they told me on
committing suicide  if anything could have strengthened her in her
resolution it would certainly have been the insupportable monotony of
such an existence

the terrible crowd with which these halls and galleries were filled so
shocked me that i abridged my stay within the shortest limits and
declined to see that portion of the building in which the refractory and
violent were under closer restraint  i have no doubt that the gentleman
who presided over this establishment at the time i write of was
competent to manage it and had done all in his power to promote its
usefulness but will it be believed that the miserable strife of party
feeling is carried even into this sad refuge of afflicted and degraded
humanity?  will it be believed that the eyes which are to watch over and
control the wanderings of minds on which the most dreadful visitation to
which our nature is exposed has fallen must wear the glasses of some
wretched side in politics?  will it be believed that the governor of such
a house as this is appointed and deposed and changed perpetually as
parties fluctuate and vary and as their despicable weathercocks are
blown this way or that?  a hundred times in every week some new most
paltry exhibition of that narrow-minded and injurious party spirit which
is the simoom of america sickening and blighting everything of wholesome
life within its reach was forced upon my notice but i never turned my
back upon it with feelings of such deep disgust and measureless contempt
as when i crossed the threshold of this madhouse

at a short distance from this building is another called the alms house
that is to say the workhouse of new york  this is a large institution
also lodging i believe when i was there nearly a thousand poor  it
was badly ventilated and badly lighted was not too clean—and impressed
me on the whole very uncomfortably  but it must be remembered that new
york as a great emporium of commerce and as a place of general resort
not only from all parts of the states but from most parts of the world
has always a large pauper population to provide for and labours
therefore under peculiar difficulties in this respect  nor must it be
forgotten that new york is a large town and that in all large towns a
vast amount of good and evil is intermixed and jumbled up together

in the same neighbourhood is the farm where young orphans are nursed and
bred  i did not see it but i believe it is well conducted and i can
the more easily credit it from knowing how mindful they usually are in
america of that beautiful passage in the litany which remembers all sick
persons and young children

i was taken to these institutions by water in a boat belonging to the
island jail and rowed by a crew of prisoners who were dressed in a
striped uniform of black and buff in which they looked like faded
tigers  they took me by the same conveyance to the jail itself

it is an old prison and quite a pioneer establishment on the plan i
have already described  i was glad to hear this for it is
unquestionably a very indifferent one  the most is made however of the
means it possesses and it is as well regulated as such a place can be

the women work in covered sheds erected for that purpose  if i remember
right there are no shops for the men but be that as it may the greater
part of them labour in certain stone-quarries near at hand  the day
being very wet indeed this labour was suspended and the prisoners were
in their cells  imagine these cells some two or three hundred in
number and in every one a man locked up this one at his door for air
with his hands thrust through the grate this one in bed (in the middle
of the day remember) and this one flung down in a heap upon the ground
with his head against the bars like a wild beast  make the rain pour
down outside in torrents  put the everlasting stove in the midst hot
and suffocating and vaporous as a witchs cauldron  add a collection
of gentle odours such as would arise from a thousand mildewed umbrellas
wet through and a thousand buck-baskets full of half-washed linen—and
there is the prison as it was that day

the prison for the state at sing sing is on the other hand a model
jail  that and auburn are i believe the largest and best examples of
the silent system

in another part of the city is the refuge for the destitute an
institution whose object is to reclaim youthful offenders male and
female black and white without distinction to teach them useful
trades apprentice them to respectable masters and make them worthy
members of society  its design it will be seen is similar to that at
boston and it is a no less meritorious and admirable establishment  a
suspicion crossed my mind during my inspection of this noble charity
whether the superintendent had quite sufficient knowledge of the world
and worldly characters and whether he did not commit a great mistake in
treating some young girls who were to all intents and purposes by their
years and their past lives women as though they were little children
which certainly had a ludicrous effect in my eyes and or i am much
mistaken in theirs also  as the institution however is always under a
vigilant examination of a body of gentlemen of great intelligence and
experience it cannot fail to be well conducted and whether i am right
or wrong in this slight particular is unimportant to its deserts and
character which it would be difficult to estimate too highly

in addition to these establishments there are in new york excellent
hospitals and schools literary institutions and libraries an admirable
fire department (as indeed it should be having constant practice) and
charities of every sort and kind  in the suburbs there is a spacious
cemetery unfinished yet but every day improving  the saddest tomb i
saw there was  the strangers grave  dedicated to the different hotels
in this city

there are three principal theatres  two of them the park and the
bowery are large elegant and handsome buildings and are i grieve to
write it generally deserted  the third the olympic is a tiny show-box
for vaudevilles and burlesques  it is singularly well conducted by mr
mitchell a comic actor of great quiet humour and originality who is
well remembered and esteemed by london playgoers  i am happy to report
of this deserving gentleman that his benches are usually well filled
and that his theatre rings with merriment every night  i had almost
forgotten a small summer theatre called niblos with gardens and open
air amusements attached but i believe it is not exempt from the general
depression under which theatrical property or what is humorously called
by that name unfortunately labours

the country round new york is surpassingly and exquisitely picturesque
the climate as i have already intimated is somewhat of the warmest
what it would be without the sea breezes which come from its beautiful
bay in the evening time i will not throw myself or my readers into a
fever by inquiring

the tone of the best society in this city is like that of boston here
and there it may be with a greater infusion of the mercantile spirit
but generally polished and refined and always most hospitable  the
houses and tables are elegant the hours later and more rakish and there
is perhaps a greater spirit of contention in reference to appearances
and the display of wealth and costly living  the ladies are singularly
beautiful

before i left new york i made arrangements for securing a passage home in
the george washington packet ship which was advertised to sail in june
that being the month in which i had determined if prevented by no
accident in the course of my ramblings to leave america

i never thought that going back to england returning to all who are dear
to me and to pursuits that have insensibly grown to be a part of my
nature i could have felt so much sorrow as i endured when i parted at
last on board this ship with the friends who had accompanied me from
this city  i never thought the name of any place so far away and so
lately known could ever associate itself in my mind with the crowd of
affectionate remembrances that now cluster about it  there are those in
this city who would brighten to me the darkest winter-day that ever
glimmered and went out in lapland and before whose presence even home
grew dim when they and i exchanged that painful word which mingles with
our every thought and deed which haunts our cradle-heads in infancy and
closes up the vista of our lives in age




chapter vii
philadelphia and its solitary prison


the journey from new york to philadelphia is made by railroad and two
ferries and usually occupies between five and six hours  it was a fine
evening when we were passengers in the train and watching the bright
sunset from a little window near the door by which we sat my attention
was attracted to a remarkable appearance issuing from the windows of the
gentlemans car immediately in front of us which i supposed for some
time was occasioned by a number of industrious persons inside ripping
open feather-beds and giving the feathers to the wind  at length it
occurred to me that they were only spitting which was indeed the case
though how any number of passengers which it was possible for that car to
contain could have maintained such a playful and incessant shower of
expectoration i am still at a loss to understand notwithstanding the
experience in all salivatory phenomena which i afterwards acquired

i made acquaintance on this journey with a mild and modest young
quaker who opened the discourse by informing me in a grave whisper
that his grandfather was the inventor of cold-drawn castor oil  i
mention the circumstance here thinking it probable that this is the
first occasion on which the valuable medicine in question was ever used
as a conversational aperient

we reached the city late that night  looking out of my chamber-window
before going to bed i saw on the opposite side of the way a handsome
building of white marble which had a mournful ghost-like aspect dreary
to behold  i attributed this to the sombre influence of the night and
on rising in the morning looked out again expecting to see its steps and
portico thronged with groups of people passing in and out  the door was
still tight shut however the same cold cheerless air prevailed and the
building looked as if the marble statue of don guzman could alone have
any business to transact within its gloomy walls  i hastened to inquire
its name and purpose and then my surprise vanished  it was the tomb of
many fortunes the great catacomb of investment the memorable united
states bank

the stoppage of this bank with all its ruinous consequences had cast
(as i was told on every side) a gloom on philadelphia under the
depressing effect of which it yet laboured  it certainly did seem rather
dull and out of spirits

it is a handsome city but distractingly regular  after walking about it
for an hour or two i felt that i would have given the world for a
crooked street  the collar of my coat appeared to stiffen and the brim
of my hat to expand beneath its quakery influence  my hair shrunk into
a sleek short crop my hands folded themselves upon my breast of their
own calm accord and thoughts of taking lodgings in mark lane over
against the market place and of making a large fortune by speculations
in corn came over me involuntarily

philadelphia is most bountifully provided with fresh water which is
showered and jerked about and turned on and poured off everywhere
the waterworks which are on a height near the city are no less
ornamental than useful being tastefully laid out as a public garden and
kept in the best and neatest order  the river is dammed at this point
and forced by its own power into certain high tanks or reservoirs whence
the whole city to the top stories of the houses is supplied at a very
trifling expense

there are various public institutions  among them a most excellent
hospital—a quaker establishment but not sectarian in the great benefits
it confers a quiet quaint old library named after franklin a handsome
exchange and post office and so forth  in connection with the quaker
hospital there is a picture by west which is exhibited for the benefit
of the funds of the institution  the subject is our saviour healing the
sick and it is perhaps as favourable a specimen of the master as can
be seen anywhere  whether this be high or low praise depends upon the
readers taste

in the same room there is a very characteristic and life-like portrait
by mr sully a distinguished american artist

my stay in philadelphia was very short but what i saw of its society i
greatly liked  treating of its general characteristics i should be
disposed to say that it is more provincial than boston or new york and
that there is afloat in the fair city an assumption of taste and
criticism savouring rather of those genteel discussions upon the same
themes in connection with shakspeare and the musical glasses of which
we read in the vicar of wakefield  near the city is a most splendid
unfinished marble structure for the girard college founded by a deceased
gentleman of that name and of enormous wealth which if completed
according to the original design will be perhaps the richest edifice of
modern times  but the bequest is involved in legal disputes and pending
them the work has stopped so that like many other great undertakings in
america even this is rather going to be done one of these days than
doing now

in the outskirts stands a great prison called the eastern penitentiary
conducted on a plan peculiar to the state of pennsylvania  the system
here is rigid strict and hopeless solitary confinement  i believe it
in its effects to be cruel and wrong

in its intention i am well convinced that it is kind humane and meant
for reformation but i am persuaded that those who devised this system of
prison discipline and those benevolent gentlemen who carry it into
execution do not know what it is that they are doing  i believe that
very few men are capable of estimating the immense amount of torture and
agony which this dreadful punishment prolonged for years inflicts upon
the sufferers and in guessing at it myself and in reasoning from what i
have seen written upon their faces and what to my certain knowledge they
feel within i am only the more convinced that there is a depth of
terrible endurance in it which none but the sufferers themselves can
fathom and which no man has a right to inflict upon his fellow-creature
i hold this slow and daily tampering with the mysteries of the brain to
be immeasurably worse than any torture of the body and because its
ghastly signs and tokens are not so palpable to the eye and sense of
touch as scars upon the flesh because its wounds are not upon the
surface and it extorts few cries that human ears can hear therefore i
the more denounce it as a secret punishment which slumbering humanity is
not roused up to stay  i hesitated once debating with myself whether
if i had the power of saying  yes or  no i would allow it to be tried
in certain cases where the terms of imprisonment were short but now i
solemnly declare that with no rewards or honours could i walk a happy
man beneath the open sky by day or lie me down upon my bed at night
with the consciousness that one human creature for any length of time
no matter what lay suffering this unknown punishment in his silent cell
and i the cause or i consenting to it in the least degree

i was accompanied to this prison by two gentlemen officially connected
with its management and passed the day in going from cell to cell and
talking with the inmates  every facility was afforded me that the
utmost courtesy could suggest  nothing was concealed or hidden from my
view and every piece of information that i sought was openly and
frankly given  the perfect order of the building cannot be praised too
highly and of the excellent motives of all who are immediately concerned
in the administration of the system there can be no kind of question

between the body of the prison and the outer wall there is a spacious
garden  entering it by a wicket in the massive gate we pursued the
path before us to its other termination and passed into a large chamber
from which seven long passages radiate  on either side of each is a
long long row of low cell doors with a certain number over every one
above a gallery of cells like those below except that they have no
narrow yard attached (as those in the ground tier have) and are somewhat
smaller  the possession of two of these is supposed to compensate for
the absence of so much air and exercise as can be had in the dull strip
attached to each of the others in an hours time every day and
therefore every prisoner in this upper story has two cells adjoining and
communicating with each other

standing at the central point and looking down these dreary passages
the dull repose and quiet that prevails is awful  occasionally there
is a drowsy sound from some lone weavers shuttle or shoemakers last
but it is stifled by the thick walls and heavy dungeon-door and only
serves to make the general stillness more profound  over the head and
face of every prisoner who comes into this melancholy house a black hood
is drawn and in this dark shroud an emblem of the curtain dropped
between him and the living world he is led to the cell from which he
never again comes forth until his whole term of imprisonment has
expired  he never hears of wife and children home or friends the life
or death of any single creature  he sees the prison-officers but with
that exception he never looks upon a human countenance or hears a human
voice  he is a man buried alive to be dug out in the slow round of
years and in the mean time dead to everything but torturing anxieties
and horrible despair

his name and crime and term of suffering are unknown even to the
officer who delivers him his daily food  there is a number over his
cell-door and in a book of which the governor of the prison has one
copy and the moral instructor another this is the index of his history
beyond these pages the prison has no record of his existence and though
he live to be in the same cell ten weary years he has no means of
knowing down to the very last hour in which part of the building it is
situated what kind of men there are about him whether in the long
winter nights there are living people near or he is in some lonely
corner of the great jail with walls and passages and iron doors
between him and the nearest sharer in its solitary horrors

every cell has double doors the outer one of sturdy oak the other of
grated iron wherein there is a trap through which his food is handed
he has a bible and a slate and pencil and under certain restrictions
has sometimes other books provided for the purpose and pen and ink and
paper  his razor plate and can and basin hang upon the wall or
shine upon the little shelf  fresh water is laid on in every cell and
he can draw it at his pleasure  during the day his bedstead turns up
against the wall and leaves more space for him to work in  his loom or
bench or wheel is there and there he labours sleeps and wakes and
counts the seasons as they change and grows old

the first man i saw was seated at his loom at work  he had been there
six years and was to remain i think three more  he had been convicted
as a receiver of stolen goods but even after his long imprisonment
denied his guilt and said he had been hardly dealt by  it was his
second offence

he stopped his work when we went in took off his spectacles and
answered freely to everything that was said to him but always with a
strange kind of pause first and in a low thoughtful voice  he wore a
paper hat of his own making and was pleased to have it noticed and
commanded  he had very ingeniously manufactured a sort of dutch clock
from some disregarded odds and ends and his vinegar-bottle served for
the pendulum  seeing me interested in this contrivance he looked up at
it with a great deal of pride and said that he had been thinking of
improving it and that he hoped the hammer and a little piece of broken
glass beside it  would play music before long  he had extracted some
colours from the yarn with which he worked and painted a few poor
figures on the wall  one of a female over the door he called  the
lady of the lake

he smiled as i looked at these contrivances to while away the time but
when i looked from them to him i saw that his lip trembled and could
have counted the beating of his heart  i forget how it came about but
some allusion was made to his having a wife  he shook his head at the
word turned aside and covered his face with his hands

 but you are resigned now said one of the gentlemen after a short
pause during which he had resumed his former manner  he answered with a
sigh that seemed quite reckless in its hopelessness  oh yes oh yes  i
am resigned to it   and are a better man you think?   well i hope
so im sure i hope i may be   and time goes pretty quickly?   time is
very long gentlemen within these four walls

he gazed about him—heaven only knows how wearily—as he said these words
and in the act of doing so fell into a strange stare as if he had
forgotten something  a moment afterwards he sighed heavily put on his
spectacles and went about his work again

in another cell there was a german sentenced to five years
imprisonment for larceny two of which had just expired  with colours
procured in the same manner he had painted every inch of the walls and
ceiling quite beautifully  he had laid out the few feet of ground
behind with exquisite neatness and had made a little bed in the centre
that looked by-the-bye like a grave  the taste and ingenuity he had
displayed in everything were most extraordinary and yet a more dejected
heart-broken wretched creature it would be difficult to imagine  i
never saw such a picture of forlorn affliction and distress of mind  my
heart bled for him and when the tears ran down his cheeks and he took
one of the visitors aside to ask with his trembling hands nervously
clutching at his coat to detain him whether there was no hope of his
dismal sentence being commuted the spectacle was really too painful to
witness  i never saw or heard of any kind of misery that impressed me
more than the wretchedness of this man

in a third cell was a tall strong black a burglar working at his
proper trade of making screws and the like  his time was nearly out  he
was not only a very dexterous thief but was notorious for his boldness
and hardihood and for the number of his previous convictions  he
entertained us with a long account of his achievements which he narrated
with such infinite relish that he actually seemed to lick his lips as he
told us racy anecdotes of stolen plate and of old ladies whom he had
watched as they sat at windows in silver spectacles (he had plainly had
an eye to their metal even from the other side of the street) and had
afterwards robbed  this fellow upon the slightest encouragement would
have mingled with his professional recollections the most detestable
cant but i am very much mistaken if he could have surpassed the
unmitigated hypocrisy with which he declared that he blessed the day on
which he came into that prison and that he never would commit another
robbery as long as he lived

there was one man who was allowed as an indulgence to keep rabbits
his room having rather a close smell in consequence they called to him
at the door to come out into the passage  he complied of course and
stood shading his haggard face in the unwonted sunlight of the great
window looking as wan and unearthly as if he had been summoned from the
grave  he had a white rabbit in his breast and when the little
creature getting down upon the ground stole back into the cell and he
being dismissed crept timidly after it i thought it would have been
very hard to say in what respect the man was the nobler animal of the
two

there was an english thief who had been there but a few days out of
seven years a villainous low-browed thin-lipped fellow with a white
face who had as yet no relish for visitors and who but for the
additional penalty would have gladly stabbed me with his shoemakers
knife  there was another german who had entered the jail but yesterday
and who started from his bed when we looked in and pleaded in his
broken english very hard for work  there was a poet who after doing
two days work in every four-and-twenty hours one for himself and one
for the prison wrote verses about ships (he was by trade a mariner) and
 the maddening wine-cup and his friends at home  there were very many
of them  some reddened at the sight of visitors and some turned very
pale  some two or three had prisoner nurses with them for they were
very sick and one a fat old negro whose leg had been taken off within
the jail had for his attendant a classical scholar and an accomplished
surgeon himself a prisoner likewise  sitting upon the stairs engaged
in some slight work was a pretty coloured boy  is there no refuge for
young criminals in philadelphia then? said i   yes but only for white
children  noble aristocracy in crime

there was a sailor who had been there upwards of eleven years and who in
a few months time would be free  eleven years of solitary confinement

 i am very glad to hear your time is nearly out  what does he say?
nothing  why does he stare at his hands and pick the flesh upon his
fingers and raise his eyes for an instant every now and then to those
bare walls which have seen his head turn grey?  it is a way he has
sometimes

does he never look men in the face and does he always pluck at those
hands of his as though he were bent on parting skin and bone?  it is his
humour nothing more

it is his humour too to say that he does not look forward to going out
that he is not glad the time is drawing near that he did look forward to
it once but that was very long ago that he has lost all care for
everything  it is his humour to be a helpless crushed and broken man
and heaven be his witness that he has his humour thoroughly gratified

there were three young women in adjoining cells all convicted at the
same time of a conspiracy to rob their prosecutor  in the silence and
solitude of their lives they had grown to be quite beautiful  their
looks were very sad and might have moved the sternest visitor to tears
but not to that kind of sorrow which the contemplation of the men
awakens  one was a young girl not twenty as i recollect whose
snow-white room was hung with the work of some former prisoner and upon
whose downcast face the sun in all its splendour shone down through the
high chink in the wall where one narrow strip of bright blue sky was
visible  she was very penitent and quiet had come to be resigned she
said (and i believe her) and had a mind at peace   in a word you are
happy here? said one of my companions  she struggled—she did struggle
very hard—to answer yes but raising her eyes and meeting that glimpse
of freedom overhead she burst into tears and said  she tried to be
she uttered no complaint but it was natural that she should sometimes
long to go out of that one cell she could not help that she sobbed
poor thing

i went from cell to cell that day and every face i saw or word i heard
or incident i noted is present to my mind in all its painfulness  but
let me pass them by for one more pleasant glance of a prison on the
same plan which i afterwards saw at pittsburg

when i had gone over that in the same manner i asked the governor if he
had any person in his charge who was shortly going out  he had one he
said whose time was up next day but he had only been a prisoner two
years

two years  i looked back through two years of my own life—out of jail
prosperous happy surrounded by blessings comforts good fortune—and
thought how wide a gap it was and how long those two years passed in
solitary captivity would have been  i have the face of this man who was
going to be released next day before me now  it is almost more
memorable in its happiness than the other faces in their misery  how
easy and how natural it was for him to say that the system was a good
one and that the time went  pretty quick—considering and that when a
man once felt that he had offended the law and must satisfy it  he got
along somehow and so forth

 what did he call you back to say to you in that strange flutter? i
asked of my conductor when he had locked the door and joined me in the
passage

 oh  that he was afraid the soles of his boots were not fit for walking
as they were a good deal worn when he came in and that he would thank me
very much to have them mended ready

those boots had been taken off his feet and put away with the rest of
his clothes two years before

i took that opportunity of inquiring how they conducted themselves
immediately before going out adding that i presumed they trembled very
much

 well its not so much a trembling was the answer— though they do
quiver—as a complete derangement of the nervous system  they cant sign
their names to the book sometimes cant even hold the pen look about
em without appearing to know why or where they are and sometimes get
up and sit down again twenty times in a minute  this is when theyre in
the office where they are taken with the hood on as they were brought
in  when they get outside the gate they stop and look first one way
and then the other not knowing which to take  sometimes they stagger as
if they were drunk and sometimes are forced to lean against the fence
theyre so bad—but they clear off in course of time

as i walked among these solitary cells and looked at the faces of the
men within them i tried to picture to myself the thoughts and feelings
natural to their condition  i imagined the hood just taken off and the
scene of their captivity disclosed to them in all its dismal monotony

at first the man is stunned  his confinement is a hideous vision and
his old life a reality  he throws himself upon his bed and lies there
abandoned to despair  by degrees the insupportable solitude and
barrenness of the place rouses him from this stupor and when the trap in
his grated door is opened he humbly begs and prays for work   give me
some work to do or i shall go raving mad

he has it and by fits and starts applies himself to labour but every
now and then there comes upon him a burning sense of the years that must
be wasted in that stone coffin and an agony so piercing in the
recollection of those who are hidden from his view and knowledge that he
starts from his seat and striding up and down the narrow room with both
hands clasped on his uplifted head hears spirits tempting him to beat
his brains out on the wall

again he falls upon his bed and lies there moaning  suddenly he starts
up wondering whether any other man is near whether there is another
cell like that on either side of him and listens keenly

there is no sound but other prisoners may be near for all that  he
remembers to have heard once when he little thought of coming here
himself that the cells were so constructed that the prisoners could not
hear each other though the officers could hear them  where is the
nearest man—upon the right or on the left? or is there one in both
directions?  where is he sitting now—with his face to the light? or is he
walking to and fro?  how is he dressed? has he been here long?  is he
much worn away?  is he very white and spectre-like?  does he think of
his neighbour too?

scarcely venturing to breathe and listening while he thinks he conjures
up a figure with his back towards him and imagines it moving about in
this next cell  he has no idea of the face but he is certain of the
dark form of a stooping man  in the cell upon the other side he puts
another figure whose face is hidden from him also  day after day and
often when he wakes up in the middle of the night he thinks of these two
men until he is almost distracted  he never changes them  there they
are always as he first imagined them—an old man on the right a younger
man upon the left—whose hidden features torture him to death and have a
mystery that makes him tremble

the weary days pass on with solemn pace like mourners at a funeral and
slowly he begins to feel that the white walls of the cell have something
dreadful in them that their colour is horrible that their smooth
surface chills his blood that there is one hateful corner which torments
him  every morning when he wakes he hides his head beneath the
coverlet and shudders to see the ghastly ceiling looking down upon him
the blessed light of day itself peeps in an ugly phantom face through
the unchangeable crevice which is his prison window

by slow but sure degrees the terrors of that hateful corner swell until
they beset him at all times invade his rest make his dreams hideous
and his nights dreadful  at first he took a strange dislike to it
feeling as though it gave birth in his brain to something of
corresponding shape which ought not to be there and racked his head
with pains  then he began to fear it then to dream of it and of men
whispering its name and pointing to it  then he could not bear to look
at it nor yet to turn his back upon it  now it is every night the
lurking-place of a ghost a shadow—a silent something horrible to see
but whether bird or beast or muffled human shape he cannot tell

                     [picture the solitary prisoner]

when he is in his cell by day he fears the little yard without  when he
is in the yard he dreads to re-enter the cell  when night comes there
stands the phantom in the corner  if he have the courage to stand in its
place and drive it out (he had once being desperate) it broods upon
his bed  in the twilight and always at the same hour a voice calls to
him by name as the darkness thickens his loom begins to live and even
that his comfort is a hideous figure watching him till daybreak

again by slow degrees these horrible fancies depart from him one by
one returning sometimes unexpectedly but at longer intervals and in
less alarming shapes  he has talked upon religious matters with the
gentleman who visits him and has read his bible and has written a
prayer upon his slate and hung it up as a kind of protection and an
assurance of heavenly companionship  he dreams now sometimes of his
children or his wife but is sure that they are dead or have deserted
him  he is easily moved to tears is gentle submissive and
broken-spirited  occasionally the old agony comes back a very little
thing will revive it even a familiar sound or the scent of summer
flowers in the air but it does not last long now for the world
without has come to be the vision and this solitary life the sad
reality

if his term of imprisonment be short—i mean comparatively for short it
cannot be—the last half year is almost worse than all for then he thinks
the prison will take fire and he be burnt in the ruins or that he is
doomed to die within the walls or that he will be detained on some false
charge and sentenced for another term or that something no matter what
must happen to prevent his going at large  and this is natural and
impossible to be reasoned against because after his long separation
from human life and his great suffering any event will appear to him
more probable in the contemplation than the being restored to liberty
and his fellow-creatures

if his period of confinement have been very long the prospect of release
bewilders and confuses him  his broken heart may flutter for a moment
when he thinks of the world outside and what it might have been to him
in all those lonely years but that is all  the cell-door has been
closed too long on all its hopes and cares  better to have hanged him in
the beginning than bring him to this pass and send him forth to mingle
with his kind who are his kind no more

on the haggard face of every man among these prisoners the same
expression sat  i know not what to liken it to  it had something of
that strained attention which we see upon the faces of the blind and
deaf mingled with a kind of horror as though they had all been secretly
terrified  in every little chamber that i entered and at every grate
through which i looked i seemed to see the same appalling countenance
it lives in my memory with the fascination of a remarkable picture
parade before my eyes a hundred men with one among them newly released
from this solitary suffering and i would point him out

the faces of the women as i have said it humanises and refines
whether this be because of their better nature which is elicited in
solitude or because of their being gentler creatures of greater
patience and longer suffering i do not know but so it is  that the
punishment is nevertheless to my thinking fully as cruel and as wrong
in their case as in that of the men i need scarcely add

my firm conviction is that independent of the mental anguish it
occasions—an anguish so acute and so tremendous that all imagination of
it must fall far short of the reality—it wears the mind into a morbid
state which renders it unfit for the rough contact and busy action of
the world  it is my fixed opinion that those who have undergone this
punishment must pass into society again morally unhealthy and diseased
there are many instances on record of men who have chosen or have been
condemned to lives of perfect solitude but i scarcely remember one
even among sages of strong and vigorous intellect where its effect has
not become apparent in some disordered train of thought or some gloomy
hallucination  what monstrous phantoms bred of despondency and doubt
and born and reared in solitude have stalked upon the earth making
creation ugly and darkening the face of heaven

suicides are rare among these prisoners are almost indeed unknown
but no argument in favour of the system can reasonably be deduced from
this circumstance although it is very often urged  all men who have
made diseases of the mind their study know perfectly well that such
extreme depression and despair as will change the whole character and
beat down all its powers of elasticity and self-resistance may be at
work within a man and yet stop short of self-destruction  this is a
common case

that it makes the senses dull and by degrees impairs the bodily
faculties i am quite sure  i remarked to those who were with me in this
very establishment at philadelphia that the criminals who had been there
long were deaf  they who were in the habit of seeing these men
constantly were perfectly amazed at the idea which they regarded as
groundless and fanciful  and yet the very first prisoner to whom they
appealed—one of their own selection confirmed my impression (which was
unknown to him) instantly and said with a genuine air it was impossible
to doubt that he couldnt think how it happened but he was growing
very dull of hearing

that it is a singularly unequal punishment and affects the worst man
least there is no doubt  in its superior efficiency as a means of
reformation compared with that other code of regulations which allows
the prisoners to work in company without communicating together i have
not the smallest faith  all the instances of reformation that were
mentioned to me were of a kind that might have been—and i have no doubt
whatever in my own mind would have been—equally well brought about by
the silent system  with regard to such men as the negro burglar and the
english thief even the most enthusiastic have scarcely any hope of their
conversion

it seems to me that the objection that nothing wholesome or good has ever
had its growth in such unnatural solitude and that even a dog or any of
the more intelligent among beasts would pine and mope and rust away
beneath its influence would be in itself a sufficient argument against
this system  but when we recollect in addition how very cruel and
severe it is and that a solitary life is always liable to peculiar and
distinct objections of a most deplorable nature which have arisen here
and call to mind moreover that the choice is not between this system
and a bad or ill-considered one but between it and another which has
worked well and is in its whole design and practice excellent there
is surely more than sufficient reason for abandoning a mode of punishment
attended by so little hope or promise and fraught beyond dispute with
such a host of evils

as a relief to its contemplation i will close this chapter with a
curious story arising out of the same theme which was related to me on
the occasion of this visit by some of the gentlemen concerned

at one of the periodical meetings of the inspectors of this prison a
working man of philadelphia presented himself before the board and
earnestly requested to be placed in solitary confinement  on being asked
what motive could possibly prompt him to make this strange demand he
answered that he had an irresistible propensity to get drunk that he was
constantly indulging it to his great misery and ruin that he had no
power of resistance that he wished to be put beyond the reach of
temptation and that he could think of no better way than this  it was
pointed out to him in reply that the prison was for criminals who had
been tried and sentenced by the law and could not be made available for
any such fanciful purposes he was exhorted to abstain from intoxicating
drinks as he surely might if he would and received other very good
advice with which he retired exceedingly dissatisfied with the result
of his application

he came again and again and again and was so very earnest and
importunate that at last they took counsel together and said  he will
certainly qualify himself for admission if we reject him any more  let
us shut him up  he will soon be glad to go away and then we shall get
rid of him  so they made him sign a statement which would prevent his
ever sustaining an action for false imprisonment to the effect that his
incarceration was voluntary and of his own seeking they requested him
to take notice that the officer in attendance had orders to release him
at any hour of the day or night when he might knock upon his door for
that purpose but desired him to understand that once going out he
would not be admitted any more  these conditions agreed upon and he
still remaining in the same mind he was conducted to the prison and
shut up in one of the cells

in this cell the man who had not the firmness to leave a glass of
liquor standing untasted on a table before him—in this cell in solitary
confinement and working every day at his trade of shoemaking this man
remained nearly two years  his health beginning to fail at the
expiration of that time the surgeon recommended that he should work
occasionally in the garden and as he liked the notion very much he went
about this new occupation with great cheerfulness

he was digging here one summer day very industriously when the wicket
in the outer gate chanced to be left open showing beyond the
well-remembered dusty road and sunburnt fields  the way was as free to
him as to any man living but he no sooner raised his head and caught
sight of it all shining in the light than with the involuntary
instinct of a prisoner he cast away his spade scampered off as fast as
his legs would carry him and never once looked back




chapter viii
washington  the legislature  and the presidents house


we left philadelphia by steamboat at six oclock one very cold morning
and turned our faces towards washington

in the course of this days journey as on subsequent occasions we
encountered some englishmen (small farmers perhaps or country publicans
at home) who were settled in america and were travelling on their own
affairs  of all grades and kinds of men that jostle one in the public
conveyances of the states these are often the most intolerable and the
most insufferable companions  united to every disagreeable
characteristic that the worst kind of american travellers possess these
countrymen of ours display an amount of insolent conceit and cool
assumption of superiority quite monstrous to behold  in the coarse
familiarity of their approach and the effrontery of their
inquisitiveness (which they are in great haste to assert as if they
panted to revenge themselves upon the decent old restraints of home)
they surpass any native specimens that came within my range of
observation and i often grew so patriotic when i saw and heard them
that i would cheerfully have submitted to a reasonable fine if i could
have given any other country in the whole world the honour of claiming
them for its children

as washington may be called the head-quarters of tobacco-tinctured
saliva the time is come when i must confess without any disguise that
the prevalence of those two odious practices of chewing and expectorating
began about this time to be anything but agreeable and soon became most
offensive and sickening  in all the public places of america this
filthy custom is recognised  in the courts of law the judge has his
spittoon the crier his the witness his and the prisoner his while the
jurymen and spectators are provided for as so many men who in the course
of nature must desire to spit incessantly  in the hospitals the
students of medicine are requested by notices upon the wall to eject
their tobacco juice into the boxes provided for that purpose and not to
discolour the stairs  in public buildings visitors are implored
through the same agency to squirt the essence of their quids or
 plugs as i have heard them called by gentlemen learned in this kind of
sweetmeat into the national spittoons and not about the bases of the
marble columns  but in some parts this custom is inseparably mixed up
with every meal and morning call and with all the transactions of social
life  the stranger who follows in the track i took myself will find it
in its full bloom and glory luxuriant in all its alarming recklessness
at washington  and let him not persuade himself (as i once did to my
shame) that previous tourists have exaggerated its extent  the thing
itself is an exaggeration of nastiness which cannot be outdone

on board this steamboat there were two young gentlemen with
shirt-collars reversed as usual and armed with very big walking-sticks
who planted two seats in the middle of the deck at a distance of some
four paces apart took out their tobacco-boxes and sat down opposite
each other to chew  in less than a quarter of an hours time these
hopeful youths had shed about them on the clean boards a copious shower
of yellow rain clearing by that means a kind of magic circle within
whose limits no intruders dared to come and which they never failed to
refresh and re-refresh before a spot was dry  this being before
breakfast rather disposed me i confess to nausea but looking
attentively at one of the expectorators i plainly saw that he was young
in chewing and felt inwardly uneasy himself  a glow of delight came
over me at this discovery and as i marked his face turn paler and paler
and saw the ball of tobacco in his left cheek quiver with his suppressed
agony while yet he spat and chewed and spat again in emulation of his
older friend i could have fallen on his neck and implored him to go on
for hours

we all sat down to a comfortable breakfast in the cabin below where
there was no more hurry or confusion than at such a meal in england and
where there was certainly greater politeness exhibited than at most of
our stage-coach banquets  at about nine oclock we arrived at the
railroad station and went on by the cars  at noon we turned out again
to cross a wide river in another steamboat landed at a continuation of
the railroad on the opposite shore and went on by other cars in which
in the course of the next hour or so we crossed by wooden bridges each
a mile in length two creeks called respectively great and little
gunpowder  the water in both was blackened with flights of canvas-backed
ducks which are most delicious eating and abound hereabouts at that
season of the year

these bridges are of wood have no parapet and are only just wide enough
for the passage of the trains which in the event of the smallest
accident wound inevitably be plunged into the river  they are startling
contrivances and are most agreeable when passed

we stopped to dine at baltimore and being now in maryland were waited
on for the first time by slaves  the sensation of exacting any service
from human creatures who are bought and sold and being for the time a
party as it were to their condition is not an enviable one  the
institution exists perhaps in its least repulsive and most mitigated
form in such a town as this but it is slavery and though i was with
respect to it an innocent man its presence filled me with a sense of
shame and self-reproach

after dinner we went down to the railroad again and took our seats in
the cars for washington  being rather early those men and boys who
happened to have nothing particular to do and were curious in
foreigners came (according to custom) round the carriage in which i sat
let down all the windows thrust in their heads and shoulders hooked
themselves on conveniently by their elbows and fell to comparing notes
on the subject of my personal appearance with as much indifference as if
i were a stuffed figure  i never gained so much uncompromising
information with reference to my own nose and eyes and various
impressions wrought by my mouth and chin on different minds and how my
head looks when it is viewed from behind as on these occasions  some
gentlemen were only satisfied by exercising their sense of touch and the
boys (who are surprisingly precocious in america) were seldom satisfied
even by that but would return to the charge over and over again  many a
budding president has walked into my room with his cap on his head and
his hands in his pockets and stared at me for two whole hours
occasionally refreshing himself with a tweak of his nose or a draught
from the water-jug or by walking to the windows and inviting other boys
in the street below to come up and do likewise crying  here he is
 come on   bring all your brothers with other hospitable entreaties
of that nature

we reached washington at about half-past six that evening and had upon
the way a beautiful view of the capitol which is a fine building of the
corinthian order placed upon a noble and commanding eminence  arrived
at the hotel i saw no more of the place that night being very tired
and glad to get to bed

breakfast over next morning i walk about the streets for an hour or two
and coming home throw up the window in the front and back and look
out  here is washington fresh in my mind and under my eye

take the worst parts of the city road and pentonville or the straggling
outskirts of paris where the houses are smallest preserving all their
oddities but especially the small shops and dwellings occupied in
pentonville (but not in washington) by furniture-brokers keepers of poor
eating-houses and fanciers of birds  burn the whole down build it up
again in wood and plaster widen it a little throw in part of st johns
wood put green blinds outside all the private houses with a red curtain
and a white one in every window plough up all the roads plant a great
deal of coarse turf in every place where it ought not to be erect
three handsome buildings in stone and marble anywhere but the more
entirely out of everybodys way the better call one the post office one
the patent office and one the treasury make it scorching hot in the
morning and freezing cold in the afternoon with an occasional tornado
of wind and dust leave a brick-field without the bricks in all central
places where a street may naturally be expected and thats washington

the hotel in which we live is a long row of small houses fronting on the
street and opening at the back upon a common yard in which hangs a
great triangle  whenever a servant is wanted somebody beats on this
triangle from one stroke up to seven according to the number of the
house in which his presence is required and as all the servants are
always being wanted and none of them ever come this enlivening engine
is in full performance the whole day through  clothes are drying in the
same yard female slaves with cotton handkerchiefs twisted round their
heads are running to and fro on the hotel business black waiters cross
and recross with dishes in their hands two great dogs are playing upon a
mound of loose bricks in the centre of the little square a pig is
turning up his stomach to the sun and grunting  thats comfortable
and neither the men nor the women nor the dogs nor the pig nor any
created creature takes the smallest notice of the triangle which is
tingling madly all the time

i walk to the front window and look across the road upon a long
straggling row of houses one story high terminating nearly opposite
but a little to the left in a melancholy piece of waste ground with
frowzy grass which looks like a small piece of country that has taken to
drinking and has quite lost itself  standing anyhow and all wrong upon
this open space like something meteoric that has fallen down from the
moon is an odd lop-sided one-eyed kind of wooden building that looks
like a church with a flag-staff as long as itself sticking out of a
steeple something larger than a tea-chest  under the window is a small
stand of coaches whose slave-drivers are sunning themselves on the steps
of our door and talking idly together  the three most obtrusive houses
near at hand are the three meanest  on one—a shop which never has
anything in the window and never has the door open—is painted in large
characters  the city lunch  at another which looks like a backway to
somewhere else but is an independent building in itself oysters are
procurable in every style  at the third which is a very very little
tailors shop pants are fixed to order or in other words pantaloons
are made to measure  and that is our street in washington

it is sometimes called the city of magnificent distances but it might
with greater propriety be termed the city of magnificent intentions for
it is only on taking a birds-eye view of it from the top of the capitol
that one can at all comprehend the vast designs of its projector an
aspiring frenchman  spacious avenues that begin in nothing and lead
nowhere streets mile-long that only want houses roads and
inhabitants public buildings that need but a public to be complete and
ornaments of great thoroughfares which only lack great thoroughfares to
ornament—are its leading features  one might fancy the season over and
most of the houses gone out of town for ever with their masters  to the
admirers of cities it is a barmecide feast a pleasant field for the
imagination to rove in a monument raised to a deceased project with not
even a legible inscription to record its departed greatness

such as it is it is likely to remain  it was originally chosen for the
seat of government as a means of averting the conflicting jealousies and
interests of the different states and very probably too as being
remote from mobs a consideration not to be slighted even in america
it has no trade or commerce of its own having little or no population
beyond the president and his establishment the members of the
legislature who reside there during the session the government clerks
and officers employed in the various departments the keepers of the
hotels and boarding-houses and the tradesmen who supply their tables
it is very unhealthy  few people would live in washington i take it
who were not obliged to reside there and the tides of emigration and
speculation those rapid and regardless currents are little likely to
flow at any time towards such dull and sluggish water

the principal features of the capitol are of course the two houses of
assembly  but there is besides in the centre of the building a fine
rotunda ninety-six feet in diameter and ninety-six high whose circular
wall is divided into compartments ornamented by historical pictures
four of these have for their subjects prominent events in the
revolutionary struggle  they were painted by colonel trumbull himself a
member of washingtons staff at the time of their occurrence from which
circumstance they derive a peculiar interest of their own  in this same
hall mr greenoughs large statue of washington has been lately placed
it has great merits of course but it struck me as being rather strained
and violent for its subject  i could wish however to have seen it in a
better light than it can ever be viewed in where it stands

there is a very pleasant and commodious library in the capitol and from
a balcony in front the birds-eye view of which i have just spoken may
be had together with a beautiful prospect of the adjacent country  in
one of the ornamented portions of the building there is a figure of
justice whereunto the guide book says  the artist at first contemplated
giving more of nudity but he was warned that the public sentiment in
this country would not admit of it and in his caution he has gone
perhaps into the opposite extreme  poor justice she has been made to
wear much stranger garments in america than those she pines in in the
capitol  let us hope that she has changed her dress-maker since they
were fashioned and that the public sentiment of the country did not cut
out the clothes she hides her lovely figure in just now

the house of representatives is a beautiful and spacious hall of
semicircular shape supported by handsome pillars  one part of the
gallery is appropriated to the ladies and there they sit in front rows
and come in and go out as at a play or concert  the chair is canopied
and raised considerably above the floor of the house and every member
has an easy chair and a writing desk to himself which is denounced by
some people out of doors as a most unfortunate and injudicious
arrangement tending to long sittings and prosaic speeches  it is an
elegant chamber to look at but a singularly bad one for all purposes of
hearing  the senate which is smaller is free from this objection and
is exceedingly well adapted to the uses for which it is designed  the
sittings i need hardly add take place in the day and the parliamentary
forms are modelled on those of the old country

i was sometimes asked in my progress through other places whether i had
not been very much impressed by the heads of the lawmakers at
washington meaning not their chiefs and leaders but literally their
individual and personal heads whereon their hair grew and whereby the
phrenological character of each legislator was expressed and i almost as
often struck my questioner dumb with indignant consternation by answering
 no that i didnt remember being at all overcome  as i must at
whatever hazard repeat the avowal here i will follow it up by relating
my impressions on this subject in as few words as possible

in the first place—it may be from some imperfect development of my organ
of veneration—i do not remember having ever fainted away or having even
been moved to tears of joyful pride at sight of any legislative body  i
have borne the house of commons like a man and have yielded to no
weakness but slumber in the house of lords  i have seen elections for
borough and county and have never been impelled (no matter which party
won) to damage my hat by throwing it up into the air in triumph or to
crack my voice by shouting forth any reference to our glorious
constitution to the noble purity of our independent voters or the
unimpeachable integrity of our independent members  having withstood
such strong attacks upon my fortitude it is possible that i may be of a
cold and insensible temperament amounting to iciness in such matters
and therefore my impressions of the live pillars of the capitol at
washington must be received with such grains of allowance as this free
confession may seem to demand

did i see in this public body an assemblage of men bound together in the
sacred names of liberty and freedom and so asserting the chaste dignity
of those twin goddesses in all their discussions as to exalt at once
the eternal principles to which their names are given and their own
character and the character of their countrymen in the admiring eyes of
the whole world?

it was but a week since an aged grey-haired man a lasting honour to
the land that gave him birth who has done good service to his country
as his forefathers did and who will be remembered scores upon scores of
years after the worms bred in its corruption are but so many grains of
dust—it was but a week since this old man had stood for days upon his
trial before this very body charged with having dared to assert the
infamy of that traffic which has for its accursed merchandise men and
women and their unborn children  yes  and publicly exhibited in the
same city all the while gilded framed and glazed hung up for general
admiration shown to strangers not with shame but pride its face not
turned towards the wall itself not taken down and burned is the
unanimous declaration of the thirteen united states of america which
solemnly declares that all men are created equal and are endowed by
their creator with the inalienable rights of life liberty and the
pursuit of happiness

it was not a month since this same body had sat calmly by and heard a
man one of themselves with oaths which beggars in their drink reject
threaten to cut anothers throat from ear to ear  there he sat among
them not crushed by the general feeling of the assembly but as good a
man as any

there was but a week to come and another of that body for doing his
duty to those who sent him there for claiming in a republic the liberty
and freedom of expressing their sentiments and making known their
prayer would be tried found guilty and have strong censure passed upon
him by the rest  his was a grave offence indeed for years before he
had risen up and said  a gang of male and female slaves for sale
warranted to breed like cattle linked to each other by iron fetters are
passing now along the open street beneath the windows of your temple of
equality  look  but there are many kinds of hunters engaged in the
pursuit of happiness and they go variously armed  it is the inalienable
right of some among them to take the field after their happiness
equipped with cat and cartwhip stocks and iron collar and to shout
their view halloa (always in praise of liberty) to the music of clanking
chains and bloody stripes

where sat the many legislators of coarse threats of words and blows such
as coalheavers deal upon each other when they forget their breeding?  on
every side  every session had its anecdotes of that kind and the actors
were all there

did i recognise in this assembly a body of men who applying themselves
in a new world to correct some of the falsehoods and vices of the old
purified the avenues to public life paved the dirty ways to place and
power debated and made laws for the common good and had no party but
their country?

i saw in them the wheels that move the meanest perversion of virtuous
political machinery that the worst tools ever wrought  despicable
trickery at elections under-handed tamperings with public officers
cowardly attacks upon opponents with scurrilous newspapers for shields
and hired pens for daggers shameful trucklings to mercenary knaves
whose claim to be considered is that every day and week they sow new
crops of ruin with their venal types which are the dragons teeth of
yore in everything but sharpness aidings and abettings of every bad
inclination in the popular mind and artful suppressions of all its good
influences such things as these and in a word dishonest faction in its
most depraved and most unblushing form stared out from every corner of
the crowded hall

did i see among them the intelligence and refinement the true honest
patriotic heart of america?  here and there were drops of its blood and
life but they scarcely coloured the stream of desperate adventurers
which sets that way for profit and for pay  it is the game of these men
and of their profligate organs to make the strife of politics so fierce
and brutal and so destructive of all self-respect in worthy men that
sensitive and delicate-minded persons shall be kept aloof and they and
such as they be left to battle out their selfish views unchecked  and
thus this lowest of all scrambling fights goes on and they who in other
countries would from their intelligence and station most aspire to make
the laws do here recoil the farthest from that degradation

that there are among the representatives of the people in both houses
and among all parties some men of high character and great abilities i
need not say  the foremost among those politicians who are known in
europe have been already described and i see no reason to depart from
the rule i have laid down for my guidance of abstaining from all mention
of individuals  it will be sufficient to add that to the most
favourable accounts that have been written of them i more than fully and
most heartily subscribe and that personal intercourse and free
communication have bred within me not the result predicted in the very
doubtful proverb but increased admiration and respect  they are
striking men to look at hard to deceive prompt to act lions in energy
crichtons in varied accomplishments indians in fire of eye and gesture
americans in strong and generous impulse and they as well represent the
honour and wisdom of their country at home as the distinguished
gentleman who is now its minister at the british court sustains its
highest character abroad

i visited both houses nearly every day during my stay in washington  on
my initiatory visit to the house of representatives they divided against
a decision of the chair but the chair won  the second time i went the
member who was speaking being interrupted by a laugh mimicked it as
one child would in quarrelling with another and added  that he would
make honourable gentlemen opposite sing out a little more on the other
side of their mouths presently  but interruptions are rare the speaker
being usually heard in silence  there are more quarrels than with us
and more threatenings than gentlemen are accustomed to exchange in any
civilised society of which we have record but farm-yard imitations have
not as yet been imported from the parliament of the united kingdom  the
feature in oratory which appears to be the most practised and most
relished is the constant repetition of the same idea or shadow of an
idea in fresh words and the inquiry out of doors is not  what did he
say? but  how long did he speak?  these however are but enlargements
of a principle which prevails elsewhere

the senate is a dignified and decorous body and its proceedings are
conducted with much gravity and order  both houses are handsomely
carpeted but the state to which these carpets are reduced by the
universal disregard of the spittoon with which every honourable member is
accommodated and the extraordinary improvements on the pattern which are
squirted and dabbled upon it in every direction do not admit of being
described  i will merely observe that i strongly recommend all
strangers not to look at the floor and if they happen to drop anything
though it be their purse not to pick it up with an ungloved hand on any
account

it is somewhat remarkable too at first to say the least to see so many
honourable members with swelled faces and it is scarcely less remarkable
to discover that this appearance is caused by the quantity of tobacco
they contrive to stow within the hollow of the cheek  it is strange
enough too to see an honourable gentleman leaning back in his tilted
chair with his legs on the desk before him shaping a convenient  plug
with his penknife and when it is quite ready for use shooting the old
one from his mouth as from a pop-gun and clapping the new one in its
place

i was surprised to observe that even steady old chewers of great
experience are not always good marksmen which has rather inclined me to
doubt that general proficiency with the rifle of which we have heard so
much in england  several gentlemen called upon me who in the course of
conversation frequently missed the spittoon at five paces and one (but
he was certainly short-sighted) mistook the closed sash for the open
window at three  on another occasion when i dined out and was sitting
with two ladies and some gentlemen round a fire before dinner one of the
company fell short of the fireplace six distinct times  i am disposed
to think however that this was occasioned by his not aiming at that
object as there was a white marble hearth before the fender which was
more convenient and may have suited his purpose better

the patent office at washington furnishes an extraordinary example of
american enterprise and ingenuity for the immense number of models it
contains are the accumulated inventions of only five years the whole of
the previous collection having been destroyed by fire  the elegant
structure in which they are arranged is one of design rather than
execution for there is but one side erected out of four though the
works are stopped  the post office is a very compact and very beautiful
building  in one of the departments among a collection of rare and
curious articles are deposited the presents which have been made from
time to time to the american ambassadors at foreign courts by the various
potentates to whom they were the accredited agents of the republic gifts
which by the law they are not permitted to retain  i confess that i
looked upon this as a very painful exhibition and one by no means
flattering to the national standard of honesty and honour  that can
scarcely be a high state of moral feeling which imagines a gentleman of
repute and station likely to be corrupted in the discharge of his duty
by the present of a snuff-box or a richly-mounted sword or an eastern
shawl and surely the nation who reposes confidence in her appointed
servants is likely to be better served than she who makes them the
subject of such very mean and paltry suspicions

at george town in the suburbs there is a jesuit college delightfully
situated and so far as i had an opportunity of seeing well managed
many persons who are not members of the romish church avail themselves
i believe of these institutions and of the advantageous opportunities
they afford for the education of their children  the heights of this
neighbourhood above the potomac river are very picturesque and are
free i should conceive from some of the insalubrities of washington
the air at that elevation was quite cool and refreshing when in the
city it was burning hot

the presidents mansion is more like an english club-house both within
and without than any other kind of establishment with which i can
compare it  the ornamental ground about it has been laid out in garden
walks they are pretty and agreeable to the eye though they have that
uncomfortable air of having been made yesterday which is far from
favourable to the display of such beauties

my first visit to this house was on the morning after my arrival when i
was carried thither by an official gentleman who was so kind as to
charge himself with my presentation to the president

we entered a large hall and having twice or thrice rung a bell which
nobody answered walked without further ceremony through the rooms on the
ground floor as divers other gentlemen (mostly with their hats on and
their hands in their pockets) were doing very leisurely  some of these
had ladies with them to whom they were showing the premises others were
lounging on the chairs and sofas others in a perfect state of
exhaustion from listlessness were yawning drearily  the greater portion
of this assemblage were rather asserting their supremacy than doing
anything else as they had no particular business there that anybody
knew of  a few were closely eyeing the movables as if to make quite
sure that the president (who was far from popular) had not made away with
any of the furniture or sold the fixtures for his private benefit

after glancing at these loungers who were scattered over a pretty
drawing-room opening upon a terrace which commanded a beautiful prospect
of the river and the adjacent country and who were sauntering too
about a larger state-room called the eastern drawing-room we went
up-stairs into another chamber where were certain visitors waiting for
audiences  at sight of my conductor a black in plain clothes and yellow
slippers who was gliding noiselessly about and whispering messages in
the ears of the more impatient made a sign of recognition and glided
off to announce him

we had previously looked into another chamber fitted all round with a
great bare wooden desk or counter whereon lay files of newspapers to
which sundry gentlemen were referring  but there were no such means of
beguiling the time in this apartment which was as unpromising and
tiresome as any waiting-room in one of our public establishments or any
physicians dining-room during his hours of consultation at home

there were some fifteen or twenty persons in the room  one a tall
wiry muscular old man from the west sunburnt and swarthy with a brown
white hat on his knees and a giant umbrella resting between his legs
who sat bolt upright in his chair frowning steadily at the carpet and
twitching the hard lines about his mouth as if he had made up his mind
 to fix the president on what he had to say and wouldnt bate him a
grain  another a kentucky farmer six-feet-six in height with his hat
on and his hands under his coat-tails who leaned against the wall and
kicked the floor with his heel as though he had times head under his
shoe and were literally  killing him  a third an oval-faced
bilious-looking man with sleek black hair cropped close and whiskers
and beard shaved down to blue dots who sucked the head of a thick stick
and from time to time took it out of his mouth to see how it was getting
on  a fourth did nothing but whistle  a fifth did nothing but spit
and indeed all these gentlemen were so very persevering and energetic in
this latter particular and bestowed their favours so abundantly upon the
carpet that i take it for granted the presidential housemaids have high
wages or to speak more genteelly an ample amount of  compensation
which is the american word for salary in the case of all public
servants

we had not waited in this room many minutes before the black messenger
returned and conducted us into another of smaller dimensions where at
a business-like table covered with papers sat the president himself  he
looked somewhat worn and anxious and well he might being at war with
everybody—but the expression of his face was mild and pleasant and his
manner was remarkably unaffected gentlemanly and agreeable  i thought
that in his whole carriage and demeanour he became his station
singularly well

being advised that the sensible etiquette of the republican court
admitted of a traveller like myself declining without any impropriety
an invitation to dinner which did not reach me until i had concluded my
arrangements for leaving washington some days before that to which it
referred i only returned to this house once  it was on the occasion of
one of those general assemblies which are held on certain nights between
the hours of nine and twelve oclock and are called rather oddly
levees

i went with my wife at about ten  there was a pretty dense crowd of
carriages and people in the court-yard and so far as i could make out
there were no very clear regulations for the taking up or setting down of
company  there were certainly no policemen to soothe startled horses
either by sawing at their bridles or flourishing truncheons in their
eyes and i am ready to make oath that no inoffensive persons were
knocked violently on the head or poked acutely in their backs or
stomachs or brought to a standstill by any such gentle means and then
taken into custody for not moving on  but there was no confusion or
disorder  our carriage reached the porch in its turn without any
blustering swearing shouting backing or other disturbance and we
dismounted with as much ease and comfort as though we had been escorted
by the whole metropolitan force from a to z inclusive

the suite of rooms on the ground-floor were lighted up and a military
band was playing in the hall  in the smaller drawing-room the centre of
a circle of company were the president and his daughter-in-law who
acted as the lady of the mansion and a very interesting graceful and
accomplished lady too  one gentleman who stood among this group
appeared to take upon himself the functions of a master of the
ceremonies  i saw no other officers or attendants and none were needed

the great drawing-room which i have already mentioned and the other
chambers on the ground-floor were crowded to excess  the company was
not in our sense of the term select for it comprehended persons of
very many grades and classes nor was there any great display of costly
attire indeed some of the costumes may have been for aught i know
grotesque enough  but the decorum and propriety of behaviour which
prevailed were unbroken by any rude or disagreeable incident and every
man even among the miscellaneous crowd in the hall who were admitted
without any orders or tickets to look on appeared to feel that he was a
part of the institution and was responsible for its preserving a
becoming character and appearing to the best advantage

that these visitors too whatever their station were not without some
refinement of taste and appreciation of intellectual gifts and gratitude
to those men who by the peaceful exercise of great abilities shed new
charms and associations upon the homes of their countrymen and elevate
their character in other lands was most earnestly testified by their
reception of washington irving my dear friend who had recently been
appointed minister at the court of spain and who was among them that
night in his new character for the first and last time before going
abroad  i sincerely believe that in all the madness of american
politics few public men would have been so earnestly devotedly and
affectionately caressed as this most charming writer and i have seldom
respected a public assembly more than i did this eager throng when i
saw them turning with one mind from noisy orators and officers of state
and flocking with a generous and honest impulse round the man of quiet
pursuits proud in his promotion as reflecting back upon their country
and grateful to him with their whole hearts for the store of graceful
fancies he had poured out among them  long may he dispense such
treasures with unsparing hand and long may they remember him as
worthily

                                * * * * *

the term we had assigned for the duration of our stay in washington was
now at an end and we were to begin to travel for the railroad distances
we had traversed yet in journeying among these older towns are on that
great continent looked upon as nothing

i had at first intended going south—to charleston  but when i came to
consider the length of time which this journey would occupy and the
premature heat of the season which even at washington had been often
very trying and weighed moreover in my own mind the pain of living in
the constant contemplation of slavery against the more than doubtful
chances of my ever seeing it in the time i had to spare stripped of the
disguises in which it would certainly be dressed and so adding any item
to the host of facts already heaped together on the subject i began to
listen to old whisperings which had often been present to me at home in
england when i little thought of ever being here and to dream again of
cities growing up like palaces in fairy tales among the wilds and
forests of the west

the advice i received in most quarters when i began to yield to my desire
of travelling towards that point of the compass was according to custom
sufficiently cheerless my companion being threatened with more perils
dangers and discomforts than i can remember or would catalogue if i
could but of which it will be sufficient to remark that blowings-up in
steamboats and breakings-down in coaches were among the least  but
having a western route sketched out for me by the best and kindest
authority to which i could have resorted and putting no great faith in
these discouragements i soon determined on my plan of action

this was to travel south only to richmond in virginia and then to turn
and shape our course for the far west whither i beseech the readers
company in a new chapter




chapter ix
a night steamer on the potomac river  virginia road and a black driver
richmond  baltimore  the harrisburg mail and a glimpse of the city  a
canal boat


we were to proceed in the first instance by steamboat and as it is usual
to sleep on board in consequence of the starting-hour being four oclock
in the morning we went down to where she lay at that very uncomfortable
time for such expeditions when slippers are most valuable and a familiar
bed in the perspective of an hour or two looks uncommonly pleasant

it is ten oclock at night say half-past ten moonlight warm and dull
enough  the steamer (not unlike a childs noahs ark in form with the
machinery on the top of the roof) is riding lazily up and down and
bumping clumsily against the wooden pier as the ripple of the river
trifles with its unwieldy carcase  the wharf is some distance from the
city  there is nobody down here and one or two dull lamps upon the
steamers decks are the only signs of life remaining when our coach has
driven away  as soon as our footsteps are heard upon the planks a fat
negress particularly favoured by nature in respect of bustle emerges
from some dark stairs and marshals my wife towards the ladies cabin to
which retreat she goes followed by a mighty bale of cloaks and
great-coats  i valiantly resolve not to go to bed at all but to walk up
and down the pier till morning

i begin my promenade—thinking of all kinds of distant things and persons
and of nothing near—and pace up and down for half-an-hour  then i go on
board again and getting into the light of one of the lamps look at my
watch and think it must have stopped and wonder what has become of the
faithful secretary whom i brought along with me from boston  he is
supping with our late landlord (a field marshal at least no doubt) in
honour of our departure and may be two hours longer  i walk again but
it gets duller and duller the moon goes down next june seems farther
off in the dark and the echoes of my footsteps make me nervous  it has
turned cold too and walking up and down without my companion in such
lonely circumstances is but poor amusement  so i break my staunch
resolution and think it may be perhaps as well to go to bed

i go on board again open the door of the gentlemens cabin and walk in
somehow or other—from its being so quiet i suppose—i have taken it into
my head that there is nobody there  to my horror and amazement it is
full of sleepers in every stage shape attitude and variety of slumber
in the berths on the chairs on the floors on the tables and
particularly round the stove my detested enemy  i take another step
forward and slip on the shining face of a black steward who lies rolled
in a blanket on the floor  he jumps up grins half in pain and half in
hospitality whispers my own name in my ear and groping among the
sleepers leads me to my berth  standing beside it i count these
slumbering passengers and get past forty  there is no use in going
further so i begin to undress  as the chairs are all occupied and
there is nothing else to put my clothes on i deposit them upon the
ground not without soiling my hands for it is in the same condition as
the carpets in the capitol and from the same cause  having but
partially undressed i clamber on my shelf and hold the curtain open for
a few minutes while i look round on all my fellow-travellers again  that
done i let it fall on them and on the world turn round and go to
sleep

i wake of course when we get under weigh for there is a good deal of
noise  the day is then just breaking  everybody wakes at the same time
some are self-possessed directly and some are much perplexed to make out
where they are until they have rubbed their eyes and leaning on one
elbow looked about them  some yawn some groan nearly all spit and a
few get up  i am among the risers for it is easy to feel without going
into the fresh air that the atmosphere of the cabin is vile in the last
degree  i huddle on my clothes go down into the fore-cabin get shaved
by the barber and wash myself  the washing and dressing apparatus for
the passengers generally consists of two jack-towels three small wooden
basins a keg of water and a ladle to serve it out with six square
inches of looking-glass two ditto ditto of yellow soap a comb and brush
for the head and nothing for the teeth  everybody uses the comb and
brush except myself  everybody stares to see me using my own and two
or three gentlemen are strongly disposed to banter me on my prejudices
but dont  when i have made my toilet i go upon the hurricane-deck and
set in for two hours of hard walking up and down  the sun is rising
brilliantly we are passing mount vernon where washington lies buried
the river is wide and rapid and its banks are beautiful  all the glory
and splendour of the day are coming on and growing brighter every
minute

at eight oclock we breakfast in the cabin where i passed the night but
the windows and doors are all thrown open and now it is fresh enough
there is no hurry or greediness apparent in the despatch of the meal  it
is longer than a travelling breakfast with us more orderly and more
polite

soon after nine oclock we come to potomac creek where we are to land
and then comes the oddest part of the journey  seven stage-coaches are
preparing to carry us on  some of them are ready some of them are not
ready  some of the drivers are blacks some whites  there are four
horses to each coach and all the horses harnessed or unharnessed are
there  the passengers are getting out of the steamboat and into the
coaches the luggage is being transferred in noisy wheelbarrows the
horses are frightened and impatient to start the black drivers are
chattering to them like so many monkeys and the white ones whooping like
so many drovers for the main thing to be done in all kinds of hostlering
here is to make as much noise as possible  the coaches are something
like the french coaches but not nearly so good  in lieu of springs
they are hung on bands of the strongest leather  there is very little
choice or difference between them and they may be likened to the car
portion of the swings at an english fair roofed put upon axle-trees and
wheels and curtained with painted canvas  they are covered with mud
from the roof to the wheel-tire and have never been cleaned since they
were first built

the tickets we have received on board the steamboat are marked no 1 so
we belong to coach no 1  i throw my coat on the box and hoist my wife
and her maid into the inside  it has only one step and that being about
a yard from the ground is usually approached by a chair when there is
no chair ladies trust in providence  the coach holds nine inside
having a seat across from door to door where we in england put our legs
so that there is only one feat more difficult in the performance than
getting in and that is getting out again  there is only one outside
passenger and he sits upon the box  as i am that one i climb up and
while they are strapping the luggage on the roof and heaping it into a
kind of tray behind have a good opportunity of looking at the driver

he is a negro—very black indeed  he is dressed in a coarse
pepper-and-salt suit excessively patched and darned (particularly at the
knees) grey stockings enormous unblacked high-low shoes and very short
trousers  he has two odd gloves one of parti-coloured worsted and one
of leather  he has a very short whip broken in the middle and bandaged
up with string  and yet he wears a low-crowned broad-brimmed black
hat faintly shadowing forth a kind of insane imitation of an english
coachman  but somebody in authority cries  go ahead as i am making
these observations  the mail takes the lead in a four-horse waggon and
all the coaches follow in procession headed by no 1

by the way whenever an englishman would cry  all right an american
cries  go ahead which is somewhat expressive of the national character
of the two countries

the first half-mile of the road is over bridges made of loose planks laid
across two parallel poles which tilt up as the wheels roll over them
and in the river  the river has a clayey bottom and is full of holes so
that half a horse is constantly disappearing unexpectedly and cant be
found again for some time

but we get past even this and come to the road itself which is a series
of alternate swamps and gravel-pits  a tremendous place is close before
us the black driver rolls his eyes screws his mouth up very round and
looks straight between the two leaders as if he were saying to himself
 we have done this often before but now i think we shall have a
crash  he takes a rein in each hand jerks and pulls at both and
dances on the splashboard with both feet (keeping his seat of course)
like the late lamented ducrow on two of his fiery coursers  we come to
the spot sink down in the mire nearly to the coach windows tilt on one
side at an angle of forty-five degrees and stick there  the insides
scream dismally the coach stops the horses flounder all the other six
coaches stop and their four-and-twenty horses flounder likewise but
merely for company and in sympathy with ours  then the following
circumstances occur

black driver (to the horses)   hi

nothing happens  insides scream again

black driver (to the horses)   ho

horses plunge and splash the black driver

gentleman inside (looking out)   why what on airth—

gentleman receives a variety of splashes and draws his head in again
without finishing his question or waiting for an answer

black driver (still to the horses)   jiddy  jiddy

horses pull violently drag the coach out of the hole and draw it up a
bank so steep that the black drivers legs fly up into the air and he
goes back among the luggage on the roof  but he immediately recovers
himself and cries (still to the horses)

 pill

no effect  on the contrary the coach begins to roll back upon no 2
which rolls back upon no 3 which rolls back upon no 4 and so on
until no 7 is heard to curse and swear nearly a quarter of a mile
behind

black driver (louder than before)   pill

horses make another struggle to get up the bank and again the coach
rolls backward

black driver (louder than before)   pe-e-e-ill

horses make a desperate struggle

black driver (recovering spirits)   hi jiddy jiddy pill

horses make another effort

black driver (with great vigour)   ally loo  hi  jiddy jiddy  pill
ally loo

horses almost do it

black driver (with his eyes starting out of his head)   lee den  lee
dere  hi  jiddy jiddy  pill  ally loo  lee-e-e-e-e

they run up the bank and go down again on the other side at a fearful
pace  it is impossible to stop them and at the bottom there is a deep
hollow full of water  the coach rolls frightfully  the insides scream
the mud and water fly about us  the black driver dances like a madman
suddenly we are all right by some extraordinary means and stop to
breathe

a black friend of the black driver is sitting on a fence  the black
driver recognises him by twirling his head round and round like a
harlequin rolling his eyes shrugging his shoulders and grinning from
ear to ear  he stops short turns to me and says

 we shall get you through sa like a fiddle and hope a please you when
we get you through sa  old  ooman at home sa chuckling very much
 outside gentleman sa he often remember old  ooman at home sa grinning
again

 ay ay well take care of the old woman  dont be afraid

the black driver grins again but there is another hole and beyond that
another bank close before us  so he stops short cries (to the horses
again)  easy  easy den  ease  steady  hi  jiddy  pill  ally
loo but never  lee until we are reduced to the very last extremity
and are in the midst of difficulties extrication from which appears to
be all but impossible

and so we do the ten miles or thereabouts in two hours and a half
breaking no bones though bruising a great many and in short getting
through the distance  like a fiddle

this singular kind of coaching terminates at fredericksburgh whence
there is a railway to richmond  the tract of country through which it
takes its course was once productive but the soil has been exhausted by
the system of employing a great amount of slave labour in forcing crops
without strengthening the land and it is now little better than a sandy
desert overgrown with trees  dreary and uninteresting as its aspect is
i was glad to the heart to find anything on which one of the curses of
this horrible institution has fallen and had greater pleasure in
contemplating the withered ground than the richest and most thriving
cultivation in the same place could possibly have afforded me

in this district as in all others where slavery sits brooding (i have
frequently heard this admitted even by those who are its warmest
advocates) there is an air of ruin and decay abroad which is
inseparable from the system  the barns and outhouses are mouldering
away the sheds are patched and half roofless the log cabins (built in
virginia with external chimneys made of clay or wood) are squalid in the
last degree  there is no look of decent comfort anywhere  the miserable
stations by the railway side the great wild wood-yards whence the
engine is supplied with fuel the negro children rolling on the ground
before the cabin doors with dogs and pigs the biped beasts of burden
slinking past gloom and dejection are upon them all

in the negro car belonging to the train in which we made this journey
were a mother and her children who had just been purchased the husband
and father being left behind with their old owner  the children cried
the whole way and the mother was miserys picture  the champion of
life liberty and the pursuit of happiness who had bought them rode in
the same train and every time we stopped got down to see that they
were safe  the black in sinbads travels with one eye in the middle of
his forehead which shone like a burning coal was natures aristocrat
compared with this white gentleman

                        [picture black and white]

it was between six and seven oclock in the evening when we drove to the
hotel in front of which and on the top of the broad flight of steps
leading to the door two or three citizens were balancing themselves on
rocking-chairs and smoking cigars  we found it a very large and elegant
establishment and were as well entertained as travellers need desire to
be  the climate being a thirsty one there was never at any hour of the
day a scarcity of loungers in the spacious bar or a cessation of the
mixing of cool liquors but they were a merrier people here and had
musical instruments playing to them o nights which it was a treat to
hear again

the next day and the next we rode and walked about the town which is
delightfully situated on eight hills overhanging james river a
sparkling stream studded here and there with bright islands or brawling
over broken rocks  although it was yet but the middle of march the
weather in this southern temperature was extremely warm the peech-trees
and magnolias were in full bloom and the trees were green  in a low
ground among the hills is a valley known as  bloody run from a
terrible conflict with the indians which once occurred there  it is a
good place for such a struggle and like every other spot i saw
associated with any legend of that wild people now so rapidly fading from
the earth interested me very much

the city is the seat of the local parliament of virginia and in its
shady legislative halls some orators were drowsily holding forth to the
hot noon day  by dint of constant repetition however these
constitutional sights had very little more interest for me than so many
parochial vestries and i was glad to exchange this one for a lounge in a
well-arranged public library of some ten thousand volumes and a visit to
a tobacco manufactory where the workmen are all slaves

i saw in this place the whole process of picking rolling pressing
drying packing in casks and branding  all the tobacco thus dealt with
was in course of manufacture for chewing and one would have supposed
there was enough in that one storehouse to have filled even the
comprehensive jaws of america  in this form the weed looks like the
oil-cake on which we fatten cattle and even without reference to its
consequences is sufficiently uninviting

many of the workmen appeared to be strong men and it is hardly necessary
to add that they were all labouring quietly then  after two oclock in
the day they are allowed to sing a certain number at a time  the hour
striking while i was there some twenty sang a hymn in parts and sang it
by no means ill pursuing their work meanwhile  a bell rang as i was
about to leave and they all poured forth into a building on the opposite
side of the street to dinner  i said several times that i should like to
see them at their meal but as the gentleman to whom i mentioned this
desire appeared to be suddenly taken rather deaf i did not pursue the
request  of their appearance i shall have something to say presently

on the following day i visited a plantation or farm of about twelve
hundred acres on the opposite bank of the river  here again although i
went down with the owner of the estate to  the quarter as that part of
it in which the slaves live is called i was not invited to enter into
any of their huts  all i saw of them was that they were very crazy
wretched cabins near to which groups of half-naked children basked in
the sun or wallowed on the dusty ground  but i believe that this
gentleman is a considerate and excellent master who inherited his fifty
slaves and is neither a buyer nor a seller of human stock and i am
sure from my own observation and conviction that he is a kind-hearted
worthy man

the planters house was an airy rustic dwelling that brought defoes
description of such places strongly to my recollection  the day was very
warm but the blinds being all closed and the windows and doors set wide
open a shady coolness rustled through the rooms which was exquisitely
refreshing after the glare and heat without  before the windows was an
open piazza where in what they call the hot weather—whatever that may
be—they sling hammocks and drink and doze luxuriously  i do not know
how their cool rejections may taste within the hammocks but having
experience i can report that out of them the mounds of ices and the
bowls of mint-julep and sherry-cobbler they make in these latitudes are
refreshments never to be thought of afterwards in summer by those who
would preserve contented minds

there are two bridges across the river one belongs to the railroad and
the other which is a very crazy affair is the private property of some
old lady in the neighbourhood who levies tolls upon the townspeople
crossing this bridge on my way back i saw a notice painted on the gate
cautioning all persons to drive slowly under a penalty if the offender
were a white man of five dollars if a negro fifteen stripes

the same decay and gloom that overhang the way by which it is approached
hover above the town of richmond  there are pretty villas and cheerful
houses in its streets and nature smiles upon the country round but
jostling its handsome residences like slavery itself going hand in hand
with many lofty virtues are deplorable tenements fences unrepaired
walls crumbling into ruinous heaps  hinting gloomily at things below the
surface these and many other tokens of the same description force
themselves upon the notice and are remembered with depressing influence
when livelier features are forgotten

to those who are happily unaccustomed to them the countenances in the
streets and labouring-places too are shocking  all men who know that
there are laws against instructing slaves of which the pains and
penalties greatly exceed in their amount the fines imposed on those who
maim and torture them must be prepared to find their faces very low in
the scale of intellectual expression  but the darkness—not of skin but
mind—which meets the strangers eye at every turn the brutalizing and
blotting out of all fairer characters traced by natures hand
immeasurably outdo his worst belief  that travelled creation of the
great satirists brain who fresh from living among horses peered from a
high casement down upon his own kind with trembling horror was scarcely
more repelled and daunted by the sight than those who look upon some of
these faces for the first time must surely be

i left the last of them behind me in the person of a wretched drudge
who after running to and fro all day till midnight and moping in his
stealthy winks of sleep upon the stairs betweenwhiles was washing the
dark passages at four oclock in the morning and went upon my way with a
grateful heart that i was not doomed to live where slavery was and had
never had my senses blunted to its wrongs and horrors in a slave-rocked
cradle

it had been my intention to proceed by james river and chesapeake bay to
baltimore but one of the steamboats being absent from her station
through some accident and the means of conveyance being consequently
rendered uncertain we returned to washington by the way we had come
(there were two constables on board the steamboat in pursuit of runaway
slaves) and halting there again for one night went on to baltimore next
afternoon

the most comfortable of all the hotels of which i had any experience in
the united states and they were not a few is barnums in that city
where the english traveller will find curtains to his bed for the first
and probably the last time in america (this is a disinterested remark
for i never use them) and where he will be likely to have enough water
for washing himself which is not at all a common case

this capital of the state of maryland is a bustling busy town with a
great deal of traffic of various kinds and in particular of water
commerce  that portion of the town which it most favours is none of the
cleanest it is true but the upper part is of a very different
character and has many agreeable streets and public buildings  the
washington monument which is a handsome pillar with a statue on its
summit the medical college and the battle monument in memory of an
engagement with the british at north point are the most conspicuous
among them

there is a very good prison in this city and the state penitentiary is
also among its institutions  in this latter establishment there were two
curious cases

one was that of a young man who had been tried for the murder of his
father  the evidence was entirely circumstantial and was very
conflicting and doubtful nor was it possible to assign any motive which
could have tempted him to the commission of so tremendous a crime  he
had been tried twice and on the second occasion the jury felt so much
hesitation in convicting him that they found a verdict of manslaughter
or murder in the second degree which it could not possibly be as there
had beyond all doubt been no quarrel or provocation and if he were
guilty at all he was unquestionably guilty of murder in its broadest and
worst signification

the remarkable feature in the case was that if the unfortunate deceased
were not really murdered by this own son of his he must have been
murdered by his own brother  the evidence lay in a most remarkable
manner between those two  on all the suspicious points the dead mans
brother was the witness all the explanations for the prisoner (some of
them extremely plausible) went by construction and inference to
inculcate him as plotting to fix the guilt upon his nephew  it must have
been one of them and the jury had to decide between two sets of
suspicions almost equally unnatural unaccountable and strange

the other case was that of a man who once went to a certain distillers
and stole a copper measure containing a quantity of liquor  he was
pursued and taken with the property in his possession and was sentenced
to two years imprisonment  on coming out of the jail at the expiration
of that term he went back to the same distillers and stole the same
copper measure containing the same quantity of liquor  there was not the
slightest reason to suppose that the man wished to return to prison
indeed everything but the commission of the offence made directly
against that assumption  there are only two ways of accounting for this
extraordinary proceeding  one is that after undergoing so much for this
copper measure he conceived he had established a sort of claim and right
to it  the other that by dint of long thinking about it had become a
monomania with him and had acquired a fascination which he found it
impossible to resist swelling from an earthly copper gallon into an
ethereal golden vat

after remaining here a couple of days i bound myself to a rigid adherence
to the plan i had laid down so recently and resolved to set forward on
our western journey without any more delay  accordingly having reduced
the luggage within the smallest possible compass (by sending back to new
york to be afterwards forwarded to us in canada so much of it as was
not absolutely wanted) and having procured the necessary credentials to
banking-houses on the way and having moreover looked for two evenings at
the setting sun with as well-defined an idea of the country before us as
if we had been going to travel into the very centre of that planet we
left baltimore by another railway at half-past eight in the morning and
reached the town of york some sixty miles off by the early dinner-time
of the hotel which was the starting-place of the four-horse coach
wherein we were to proceed to harrisburg

this conveyance the box of which i was fortunate enough to secure had
come down to meet us at the railroad station and was as muddy and
cumbersome as usual  as more passengers were waiting for us at the
inn-door the coachman observed under his breath in the usual
self-communicative voice looking the while at his mouldy harness as if
it were to that he was addressing himself

 i expect we shall want the big coach

i could not help wondering within myself what the size of this big coach
might be and how many persons it might be designed to hold for the
vehicle which was too small for our purpose was something larger than two
english heavy night coaches and might have been the twin-brother of a
french diligence  my speculations were speedily set at rest however
for as soon as we had dined there came rumbling up the street shaking
its sides like a corpulent giant a kind of barge on wheels  after much
blundering and backing it stopped at the door rolling heavily from side
to side when its other motion had ceased as if it had taken cold in its
damp stable and between that and the having been required in its
dropsical old age to move at any faster pace than a walk were distressed
by shortness of wind

 if here aint the harrisburg mail at last and dreadful bright and smart
to look at too cried an elderly gentleman in some excitement  darn my
mother

i dont know what the sensation of being darned may be or whether a
mans mother has a keener relish or disrelish of the process than anybody
else but if the endurance of this mysterious ceremony by the old lady in
question had depended on the accuracy of her sons vision in respect to
the abstract brightness and smartness of the harrisburg mail she would
certainly have undergone its infliction  however they booked twelve
people inside and the luggage (including such trifles as a large
rocking-chair and a good-sized dining-table) being at length made fast
upon the roof we started off in great state

at the door of another hotel there was another passenger to be taken up

 any room sir? cries the new passenger to the coachman

 well theres room enough replies the coachman without getting down
or even looking at him

 there ant no room at all sir bawls a gentleman inside  which
another gentleman (also inside) confirms by predicting that the attempt
to introduce any more passengers  wont fit nohow

the new passenger without any expression of anxiety looks into the
coach and then looks up at the coachman  now how do you mean to fix
it? says he after a pause  for i must go

the coachman employs himself in twisting the lash of his whip into a
knot and takes no more notice of the question clearly signifying that
it is anybodys business but his and that the passengers would do well
to fix it among themselves  in this state of things matters seem to be
approximating to a fix of another kind when another inside passenger in
a corner who is nearly suffocated cries faintly  ill get out

this is no matter of relief or self-congratulation to the driver for his
immovable philosophy is perfectly undisturbed by anything that happens in
the coach  of all things in the world the coach would seem to be the
very last upon his mind  the exchange is made however and then the
passenger who has given up his seat makes a third upon the box seating
himself in what he calls the middle that is with half his person on my
legs and the other half on the drivers

 go a-head capen cries the colonel who directs

 gŏ-lāng cries the capen to his company the horses and away we go

we took up at a rural bar-room after we had gone a few miles an
intoxicated gentleman who climbed upon the roof among the luggage and
subsequently slipping off without hurting himself was seen in the
distant perspective reeling back to the grog-shop where we had found him
we also parted with more of our freight at different times so that when
we came to change horses i was again alone outside

the coachmen always change with the horses and are usually as dirty as
the coach  the first was dressed like a very shabby english baker the
second like a russian peasant for he wore a loose purple camlet robe
with a fur collar tied round his waist with a parti-coloured worsted
sash grey trousers light blue gloves and a cap of bearskin  it had by
this time come on to rain very heavily and there was a cold damp mist
besides which penetrated to the skin  i was glad to take advantage of a
stoppage and get down to stretch my legs shake the water off my
great-coat and swallow the usual anti-temperance recipe for keeping out
the cold

when i mounted to my seat again i observed a new parcel lying on the
coach roof which i took to be a rather large fiddle in a brown bag  in
the course of a few miles however i discovered that it had a glazed cap
at one end and a pair of muddy shoes at the other and further observation
demonstrated it to be a small boy in a snuff-coloured coat with his arms
quite pinioned to his sides by deep forcing into his pockets  he was i
presume a relative or friend of the coachmans as he lay a-top of the
luggage with his face towards the rain and except when a change of
position brought his shoes in contact with my hat he appeared to be
asleep  at last on some occasion of our stopping this thing slowly
upreared itself to the height of three feet six and fixing its eyes on
me observed in piping accents with a complaisant yawn half quenched in
an obliging air of friendly patronage  well now stranger i guess you
find this amost like an english arternoon hey?

the scenery which had been tame enough at first was for the last ten
or twelve miles beautiful  our road wound through the pleasant valley
of the susquehanna the river dotted with innumerable green islands lay
upon our right and on the left a steep ascent craggy with broken rock
and dark with pine trees  the mist wreathing itself into a hundred
fantastic shapes moved solemnly upon the water and the gloom of evening
gave to all an air of mystery and silence which greatly enhanced its
natural interest

we crossed this river by a wooden bridge roofed and covered in on all
sides and nearly a mile in length  it was profoundly dark perplexed
with great beams crossing and recrossing it at every possible angle and
through the broad chinks and crevices in the floor the rapid river
gleamed far down below like a legion of eyes  we had no lamps and as
the horses stumbled and floundered through this place towards the
distant speck of dying light it seemed interminable  i really could not
at first persuade myself as we rumbled heavily on filling the bridge
with hollow noises and i held down my head to save it from the rafters
above but that i was in a painful dream for i have often dreamed of
toiling through such places and as often argued even at the time  this
cannot be reality

at length however we emerged upon the streets of harrisburg whose
feeble lights reflected dismally from the wet ground did not shine out
upon a very cheerful city  we were soon established in a snug hotel
which though smaller and far less splendid than many we put up at it
raised above them all in my remembrance by having for its landlord the
most obliging considerate and gentlemanly person i ever had to deal
with

as we were not to proceed upon our journey until the afternoon i walked
out after breakfast the next morning to look about me and was duly
shown a model prison on the solitary system just erected and as yet
without an inmate the trunk of an old tree to which harris the first
settler here (afterwards buried under it) was tied by hostile indians
with his funeral pile about him when he was saved by the timely
appearance of a friendly party on the opposite shore of the river the
local legislature (for there was another of those bodies here again in
full debate) and the other curiosities of the town

i was very much interested in looking over a number of treaties made from
time to time with the poor indians signed by the different chiefs at the
period of their ratification and preserved in the office of the
secretary to the commonwealth  these signatures traced of course by
their own hands are rough drawings of the creatures or weapons they were
called after  thus the great turtle makes a crooked pen-and-ink outline
of a great turtle the buffalo sketches a buffalo the war hatchet sets a
rough image of that weapon for his mark  so with the arrow the fish
the scalp the big canoe and all of them

i could not but think—as i looked at these feeble and tremulous
productions of hands which could draw the longest arrow to the head in a
stout elk-horn bow or split a bead or feather with a rifle-ball—of
crabbes musings over the parish register and the irregular scratches
made with a pen by men who would plough a lengthy furrow straight from
end to end  nor could i help bestowing many sorrowful thoughts upon the
simple warriors whose hands and hearts were set there in all truth and
honesty and who only learned in course of time from white men how to
break their faith and quibble out of forms and bonds  i wonder too
how many times the credulous big turtle or trusting little hatchet had
put his mark to treaties which were falsely read to him and had signed
away he knew not what until it went and cast him loose upon the new
possessors of the land a savage indeed

our host announced before our early dinner that some members of the
legislative body proposed to do us the honour of calling  he had kindly
yielded up to us his wifes own little parlour and when i begged that he
would show them in i saw him look with painful apprehension at its
pretty carpet though being otherwise occupied at the time the cause of
his uneasiness did not occur to me

it certainly would have been more pleasant to all parties concerned and
would not i think have compromised their independence in any material
degree if some of these gentlemen had not only yielded to the prejudice
in favour of spittoons but had abandoned themselves for the moment
even to the conventional absurdity of pocket-handkerchiefs

it still continued to rain heavily and when we went down to the canal
boat (for that was the mode of conveyance by which we were to proceed)
after dinner the weather was as unpromising and obstinately wet as one
would desire to see  nor was the sight of this canal boat in which we
were to spend three or four days by any means a cheerful one as it
involved some uneasy speculations concerning the disposal of the
passengers at night and opened a wide field of inquiry touching the
other domestic arrangements of the establishment which was sufficiently
disconcerting

however there it was—a barge with a little house in it viewed from the
outside and a caravan at a fair viewed from within the gentlemen being
accommodated as the spectators usually are in one of those locomotive
museums of penny wonders and the ladies being partitioned off by a red
curtain after the manner of the dwarfs and giants in the same
establishments whose private lives are passed in rather close
exclusiveness

we sat here looking silently at the row of little tables which extended
down both sides of the cabin and listening to the rain as it dripped and
pattered on the boat and plashed with a dismal merriment in the water
until the arrival of the railway train for whose final contribution to
our stock of passengers our departure was alone deferred  it brought a
great many boxes which were bumped and tossed upon the roof almost as
painfully as if they had been deposited on ones own head without the
intervention of a porters knot and several damp gentlemen whose
clothes on their drawing round the stove began to steam again  no
doubt it would have been a thought more comfortable if the driving rain
which now poured down more soakingly than ever had admitted of a window
being opened or if our number had been something less than thirty but
there was scarcely time to think as much when a train of three horses
was attached to the tow-rope the boy upon the leader smacked his whip
the rudder creaked and groaned complainingly and we had begun our
journey

as it continued to rain most perseveringly we all remained below the
damp gentlemen round the stove gradually becoming mildewed by the action
of the fire and the dry gentlemen lying at full length upon the seats
or slumbering uneasily with their faces on the tables or walking up and
down the cabin which it was barely possible for a man of the middle
height to do without making bald places on his head by scraping it
against the roof  at about six oclock all the small tables were put
together to form one long table and everybody sat down to tea coffee
bread butter salmon shad liver steaks potatoes pickles ham
chops black-puddings and sausages

 will you try said my opposite neighbour handing me a dish of
potatoes broken up in milk and butter  will you try some of these
fixings?

there are few words which perform such various duties as this word  fix
it is the caleb quotem of the american vocabulary  you call upon a
gentleman in a country town and his help informs you that he is  fixing
himself just now but will be down directly by which you are to
understand that he is dressing  you inquire on board a steamboat of a
fellow-passenger whether breakfast will be ready soon and he tells you
he should think so for when he was last below they were  fixing the
tables in other words laying the cloth  you beg a porter to collect
your luggage and he entreats you not to be uneasy for hell  fix it
presently and if you complain of indisposition you are advised to have
recourse to doctor so-and-so who will  fix you in no time

one night i ordered a bottle of mulled wine at an hotel where i was
staying and waited a long time for it at length it was put upon the
table with an apology from the landlord that he feared it wasnt  fixed
properly  and i recollect once at a stage-coach dinner overhearing a
very stern gentleman demand of a waiter who presented him with a plate of
underdone roast-beef  whether he called that fixing god amightys
vittles?

there is no doubt that the meal at which the invitation was tendered to
me which has occasioned this digression was disposed of somewhat
ravenously and that the gentlemen thrust the broad-bladed knives and the
two-pronged forks further down their throats than i ever saw the same
weapons go before except in the hands of a skilful juggler but no man
sat down until the ladies were seated or omitted any little act of
politeness which could contribute to their comfort  nor did i ever once
on any occasion anywhere during my rambles in america see a woman
exposed to the slightest act of rudeness incivility or even
inattention

by the time the meal was over the rain which seemed to have worn itself
out by coming down so fast was nearly over too and it became feasible
to go on deck which was a great relief notwithstanding its being a very
small deck and being rendered still smaller by the luggage which was
heaped together in the middle under a tarpaulin covering leaving on
either side a path so narrow that it became a science to walk to and
fro without tumbling overboard into the canal  it was somewhat
embarrassing at first too to have to duck nimbly every five minutes
whenever the man at the helm cried  bridge and sometimes when the cry
was  low bridge to lie down nearly flat  but custom familiarises one
to anything and there were so many bridges that it took a very short
time to get used to this

as night came on and we drew in sight of the first range of hills which
are the outposts of the alleghany mountains the scenery which had been
uninteresting hitherto became more bold and striking  the wet ground
reeked and smoked after the heavy fall of rain and the croaking of the
frogs (whose noise in these parts is almost incredible) sounded as though
a million of fairy teams with bells were travelling through the air and
keeping pace with us  the night was cloudy yet but moonlight too and
when we crossed the susquehanna river—over which there is an
extraordinary wooden bridge with two galleries one above the other so
that even there two boat teams meeting may pass without confusion—it
was wild and grand

i have mentioned my having been in some uncertainty and doubt at first
relative to the sleeping arrangements on board this boat  i remained in
the same vague state of mind until ten oclock or thereabouts when going
below i found suspended on either side of the cabin three long tiers of
hanging bookshelves designed apparently for volumes of the small octavo
size  looking with greater attention at these contrivances (wondering to
find such literary preparations in such a place) i descried on each
shelf a sort of microscopic sheet and blanket then i began dimly to
comprehend that the passengers were the library and that they were to be
arranged edge-wise on these shelves till morning

i was assisted to this conclusion by seeing some of them gathered round
the master of the boat at one of the tables drawing lots with all the
anxieties and passions of gamesters depicted in their countenances while
others with small pieces of cardboard in their hands were groping among
the shelves in search of numbers corresponding with those they had drawn
as soon as any gentleman found his number he took possession of it by
immediately undressing himself and crawling into bed  the rapidity with
which an agitated gambler subsided into a snoring slumberer was one of
the most singular effects i have ever witnessed  as to the ladies they
were already abed behind the red curtain which was carefully drawn and
pinned up the centre though as every cough or sneeze or whisper
behind this curtain was perfectly audible before it we had still a
lively consciousness of their society

the politeness of the person in authority had secured to me a shelf in a
nook near this red curtain in some degree removed from the great body of
sleepers to which place i retired with many acknowledgments to him for
his attention  i found it on after-measurement just the width of an
ordinary sheet of bath post letter-paper and i was at first in some
uncertainty as to the best means of getting into it  but the shelf being
a bottom one i finally determined on lying upon the floor rolling
gently in stopping immediately i touched the mattress and remaining for
the night with that side uppermost whatever it might be  luckily i
came upon my back at exactly the right moment  i was much alarmed on
looking upward to see by the shape of his half-yard of sacking (which
his weight had bent into an exceedingly tight bag) that there was a very
heavy gentleman above me whom the slender cords seemed quite incapable
of holding and i could not help reflecting upon the grief of my wife and
family in the event of his coming down in the night  but as i could not
have got up again without a severe bodily struggle which might have
alarmed the ladies and as i had nowhere to go to even if i had i shut
my eyes upon the danger and remained there

one of two remarkable circumstances is indisputably a fact with
reference to that class of society who travel in these boats  either
they carry their restlessness to such a pitch that they never sleep at
all or they expectorate in dreams which would be a remarkable mingling
of the real and ideal  all night long and every night on this canal
there was a perfect storm and tempest of spitting and once my coat
being in the very centre of the hurricane sustained by five gentlemen
(which moved vertically strictly carrying out reids theory of the law
of storms) i was fain the next morning to lay it on the deck and rub it
down with fair water before it was in a condition to be worn again

between five and six oclock in the morning we got up and some of us
went on deck to give them an opportunity of taking the shelves down
while others the morning being very cold crowded round the rusty stove
cherishing the newly kindled fire and filling the grate with those
voluntary contributions of which they had been so liberal all night  the
washing accommodations were primitive  there was a tin ladle chained to
the deck with which every gentleman who thought it necessary to cleanse
himself (many were superior to this weakness) fished the dirty water out
of the canal and poured it into a tin basin secured in like manner
there was also a jack-towel  and hanging up before a little
looking-glass in the bar in the immediate vicinity of the bread and
cheese and biscuits were a public comb and hair-brush

at eight oclock the shelves being taken down and put away and the
tables joined together everybody sat down to the tea coffee bread
butter salmon shad liver steak potatoes pickles ham chops
black-puddings and sausages all over again  some were fond of
compounding this variety and having it all on their plates at once  as
each gentleman got through his own personal amount of tea coffee bread
butter salmon shad liver steak potatoes pickles ham chops
black-puddings and sausages he rose up and walked off  when everybody
had done with everything the fragments were cleared away and one of the
waiters appearing anew in the character of a barber shaved such of the
company as desired to be shaved while the remainder looked on or yawned
over their newspapers  dinner was breakfast again without the tea and
coffee and supper and breakfast were identical

there was a man on board this boat with a light fresh-coloured face and
a pepper-and-salt suit of clothes who was the most inquisitive fellow
that can possibly be imagined  he never spoke otherwise than
interrogatively  he was an embodied inquiry  sitting down or standing
up still or moving walking the deck or taking his meals there he was
with a great note of interrogation in each eye two in his cocked ears
two more in his turned-up nose and chin at least half a dozen more about
the corners of his mouth and the largest one of all in his hair which
was brushed pertly off his forehead in a flaxen clump  every button in
his clothes said  eh?  whats that?  did you speak?  say that again
will you?  he was always wide awake like the enchanted bride who drove
her husband frantic always restless always thirsting for answers
perpetually seeking and never finding  there never was such a curious
man

i wore a fur great-coat at that time and before we were well clear of
the wharf he questioned me concerning it and its price and where i
bought it and when and what fur it was and what it weighed and what
it cost  then he took notice of my watch and asked me what that cost
and whether it was a french watch and where i got it and how i got it
and whether i bought it or had it given me and how it went and where
the key-hole was and when i wound it every night or every morning and
whether i ever forgot to wind it at all and if i did what then?  where
had i been to last and where was i going next and where was i going
after that and had i seen the president and what did he say and what
did i say and what did he say when i had said that?  eh?  lor now do
tell

finding that nothing would satisfy him i evaded his questions after the
first score or two and in particular pleaded ignorance respecting the
name of the fur whereof the coat was made  i am unable to say whether
this was the reason but that coat fascinated him afterwards he usually
kept close behind me as i walked and moved as i moved that he might
look at it the better and he frequently dived into narrow places after
me at the risk of his life that he might have the satisfaction of
passing his hand up the back and rubbing it the wrong way

we had another odd specimen on board of a different kind  this was a
thin-faced spare-figured man of middle age and stature dressed in a
dusty drabbish-coloured suit such as i never saw before  he was
perfectly quiet during the first part of the journey indeed i dont
remember having so much as seen him until he was brought out by
circumstances as great men often are  the conjunction of events which
made him famous happened briefly thus

the canal extends to the foot of the mountain and there of course it
stops the passengers being conveyed across it by land carriage and
taken on afterwards by another canal boat the counterpart of the first
which awaits them on the other side  there are two canal lines of
passage-boats one is called the express and one (a cheaper one) the
pioneer  the pioneer gets first to the mountain and waits for the
express people to come up both sets of passengers being conveyed across
it at the same time  we were the express company but when we had
crossed the mountain and had come to the second boat the proprietors
took it into their beads to draft all the pioneers into it likewise so
that we were five-and-forty at least and the accession of passengers was
not at all of that kind which improved the prospect of sleeping at night
our people grumbled at this as people do in such cases but suffered the
boat to be towed off with the whole freight aboard nevertheless and away
we went down the canal  at home i should have protested lustily but
being a foreigner here i held my peace  not so this passenger  he
cleft a path among the people on deck (we were nearly all on deck) and
without addressing anybody whomsoever soliloquised as follows

 this may suit you this may but it dont suit me  this may be all
very well with down easters and men of boston raising but it wont suit
my figure nohow and no two ways about that and so i tell you  now
im from the brown forests of mississippi i am and when the sun
shines on me it does shine—a little  it dont glimmer where i live
the sun dont  no  im a brown forester i am  i ant a johnny cake
there are no smooth skins where i live  were rough men there  rather
if down easters and men of boston raising like this im glad of it but
im none of that raising nor of that breed  no  this company wants a
little fixing it does  im the wrong sort of man for em i am
they wont like me they wont  this is piling of it up a little too
mountainous this is  at the end of every one of these short sentences
he turned upon his heel and walked the other way checking himself
abruptly when he had finished another short sentence and turning back
again

it is impossible for me to say what terrific meaning was hidden in the
words of this brown forester but i know that the other passengers looked
on in a sort of admiring horror and that presently the boat was put back
to the wharf and as many of the pioneers as could be coaxed or bullied
into going away were got rid of

when we started again some of the boldest spirits on board made bold to
say to the obvious occasion of this improvement in our prospects  much
obliged to you sir whereunto the brown forester (waving his hand and
still walking up and down as before) replied  no you ant  youre none
o my raising  you may act for yourselves you may  i have pinted out
the way  down easters and johnny cakes can follow if they please  i
ant a johnny cake i ant  i am from the brown forests of the
mississippi i am—and so on as before  he was unanimously voted one of
the tables for his bed at night—there is a great contest for the
tables—in consideration for his public services and he had the warmest
corner by the stove throughout the rest of the journey  but i never
could find out that he did anything except sit there nor did i hear him
speak again until in the midst of the bustle and turmoil of getting the
luggage ashore in the dark at pittsburg i stumbled over him as he sat
smoking a cigar on the cabin steps and heard him muttering to himself
with a short laugh of defiance  i ant a johnny cake—i ant  im from
the brown forests of the mississippi i am damme  i am inclined to
argue from this that he had never left off saying so but i could not
make an affidavit of that part of the story if required to do so by my
queen and country

as we have not reached pittsburg yet however in the order of our
narrative i may go on to remark that breakfast was perhaps the least
desirable meal of the day as in addition to the many savoury odours
arising from the eatables already mentioned there were whiffs of gin
whiskey brandy and rum from the little bar hard by and a decided
seasoning of stale tobacco  many of the gentlemen passengers were far
from particular in respect of their linen which was in some cases as
yellow as the little rivulets that had trickled from the corners of their
mouths in chewing and dried there  nor was the atmosphere quite free
from zephyr whisperings of the thirty beds which had just been cleared
away and of which we were further and more pressingly reminded by the
occasional appearance on the table-cloth of a kind of game not mentioned
in the bill of fare

and yet despite these oddities—and even they had for me at least a
humour of their own—there was much in this mode of travelling which i
heartily enjoyed at the time and look back upon with great pleasure
even the running up bare-necked at five oclock in the morning from
the tainted cabin to the dirty deck scooping up the icy water plunging
ones head into it and drawing it out all fresh and glowing with the
cold was a good thing  the fast brisk walk upon the towing-path
between that time and breakfast when every vein and artery seemed to
tingle with health the exquisite beauty of the opening day when light
came gleaming off from everything the lazy motion of the boat when one
lay idly on the deck looking through rather than at the deep blue sky
the gliding on at night so noiselessly past frowning hills sullen with
dark trees and sometimes angry in one red burning spot high up where
unseen men lay crouching round a fire the shining out of the bright
stars undisturbed by noise of wheels or steam or any other sound than
the limpid rippling of the water as the boat went on all these were pure
delights

then there were new settlements and detached log-cabins and frame-houses
full of interest for strangers from an old country cabins with simple
ovens outside made of clay and lodgings for the pigs nearly as good as
many of the human quarters broken windows patched with worn-out hats
old clothes old boards fragments of blankets and paper and home-made
dressers standing in the open air without the door whereon was ranged
the household store not hard to count of earthen jars and pots  the
eye was pained to see the stumps of great trees thickly strewn in every
field of wheat and seldom to lose the eternal swamp and dull morass
with hundreds of rotten trunks and twisted branches steeped in its
unwholesome water  it was quite sad and oppressive to come upon great
tracts where settlers had been burning down the trees and where their
wounded bodies lay about like those of murdered creatures while here
and there some charred and blackened giant reared aloft two withered
arms and seemed to call down curses on his foes  sometimes at night
the way wound through some lonely gorge like a mountain pass in
scotland shining and coldly glittering in the light of the moon and so
closed in by high steep hills all round that there seemed to be no
egress save through the narrower path by which we had come until one
rugged hill-side seemed to open and shutting out the moonlight as we
passed into its gloomy throat wrapped our new course in shade and
darkness

we had left harrisburg on friday  on sunday morning we arrived at the
foot of the mountain which is crossed by railroad  there are ten
inclined planes five ascending and five descending the carriages are
dragged up the former and let slowly down the latter by means of
stationary engines the comparatively level spaces between being
traversed sometimes by horse and sometimes by engine power as the case
demands  occasionally the rails are laid upon the extreme verge of a
giddy precipice and looking from the carriage window the traveller
gazes sheer down without a stone or scrap of fence between into the
mountain depths below  the journey is very carefully made however only
two carriages travelling together and while proper precautions are
taken is not to be dreaded for its dangers

it was very pretty travelling thus at a rapid pace along the heights of
the mountain in a keen wind to look down into a valley full of light and
softness catching glimpses through the tree-tops of scattered cabins
children running to the doors dogs bursting out to bark whom we could
see without hearing terrified pigs scampering homewards families
sitting out in their rude gardens cows gazing upward with a stupid
indifference men in their shirt-sleeves looking on at their unfinished
houses planning out to-morrows work and we riding onward high above
them like a whirlwind  it was amusing too when we had dined and
rattled down a steep pass having no other moving power than the weight
of the carriages themselves to see the engine released long after us
come buzzing down alone like a great insect its back of green and gold
so shining in the sun that if it had spread a pair of wings and soared
away no one would have had occasion as i fancied for the least
surprise  but it stopped short of us in a very business-like manner when
we reached the canal and before we left the wharf went panting up this
hill again with the passengers who had waited our arrival for the means
of traversing the road by which we had come

on the monday evening furnace fires and clanking hammers on the banks of
the canal warned us that we approached the termination of this part of
our journey  after going through another dreamy place—a long aqueduct
across the alleghany river which was stranger than the bridge at
harrisburg being a vast low wooden chamber full of water—we emerged
upon that ugly confusion of backs of buildings and crazy galleries and
stairs which always abuts on water whether it be river sea canal or
ditch and were at pittsburg

pittsburg is like birmingham in england at least its townspeople say so
setting aside the streets the shops the houses waggons factories
public buildings and population perhaps it may be  it certainly has a
great quantity of smoke hanging about it and is famous for its
iron-works  besides the prison to which i have already referred this
town contains a pretty arsenal and other institutions  it is very
beautifully situated on the alleghany river over which there are two
bridges and the villas of the wealthier citizens sprinkled about the
high grounds in the neighbourhood are pretty enough  we lodged at a
most excellent hotel and were admirably served  as usual it was full of
boarders was very large and had a broad colonnade to every story of the
house

we tarried here three days  our next point was cincinnati and as this
was a steamboat journey and western steamboats usually blow up one or
two a week in the season it was advisable to collect opinions in
reference to the comparative safety of the vessels bound that way then
lying in the river  one called the messenger was the best recommended
she had been advertised to start positively every day for a fortnight or
so and had not gone yet nor did her captain seem to have any very fixed
intention on the subject  but this is the custom for if the law were to
bind down a free and independent citizen to keep his word with the
public what would become of the liberty of the subject?  besides it is
in the way of trade  and if passengers be decoyed in the way of trade
and people be inconvenienced in the way of trade what man who is a
sharp tradesman himself shall say  we must put a stop to this?

impressed by the deep solemnity of the public announcement i (being then
ignorant of these usages) was for hurrying on board in a breathless
state immediately but receiving private and confidential information
that the boat would certainly not start until friday april the first we
made ourselves very comfortable in the mean while and went on board at
noon that day




chapter xi
from pittsburg to cincinnati in a western steamboat  cincinnati


the messenger was one among a crowd of high-pressure steamboats
clustered together by a wharf-side which looked down upon from the
rising ground that forms the landing-place and backed by the lofty bank
on the opposite side of the river appeared no larger than so many
floating models  she had some forty passengers on board exclusive of
the poorer persons on the lower deck and in half an hour or less
proceeded on her way

we had for ourselves a tiny state-room with two berths in it opening
out of the ladies cabin  there was undoubtedly something satisfactory
in this  location inasmuch as it was in the stern and we had been a
great many times very gravely recommended to keep as far aft as possible
 because the steamboats generally blew up forward  nor was this an
unnecessary caution as the occurrence and circumstances of more than one
such fatality during our stay sufficiently testified  apart from this
source of self-congratulation it was an unspeakable relief to have any
place no matter how confined where one could be alone and as the row
of little chambers of which this was one had each a second glass-door
besides that in the ladies cabin which opened on a narrow gallery
outside the vessel where the other passengers seldom came and where one
could sit in peace and gaze upon the shifting prospect we took
possession of our new quarters with much pleasure

if the native packets i have already described be unlike anything we are
in the habit of seeing on water these western vessels are still more
foreign to all the ideas we are accustomed to entertain of boats  i
hardly know what to liken them to or how to describe them

in the first place they have no mast cordage tackle rigging or other
such boat-like gear nor have they anything in their shape at all
calculated to remind one of a boats head stem sides or keel  except
that they are in the water and display a couple of paddle-boxes they
might be intended for anything that appears to the contrary to perform
some unknown service high and dry upon a mountain top  there is no
visible deck even nothing but a long black ugly roof covered with
burnt-out feathery sparks above which tower two iron chimneys and a
hoarse escape valve and a glass steerage-house  then in order as the
eye descends towards the water are the sides and doors and windows of
the state-rooms jumbled as oddly together as though they formed a small
street built by the varying tastes of a dozen men the whole is
supported on beams and pillars resting on a dirty barge but a few inches
above the waters edge and in the narrow space between this upper
structure and this barges deck are the furnace fires and machinery
open at the sides to every wind that blows and every storm of rain it
drives along its path

passing one of these boats at night and seeing the great body of fire
exposed as i have just described that rages and roars beneath the frail
pile of painted wood the machinery not warded off or guarded in any
way but doing its work in the midst of the crowd of idlers and emigrants
and children who throng the lower deck under the management too of
reckless men whose acquaintance with its mysteries may have been of six
months standing one feels directly that the wonder is not that there
should be so many fatal accidents but that any journey should be safely
made

within there is one long narrow cabin the whole length of the boat
from which the state-rooms open on both sides  a small portion of it at
the stern is partitioned off for the ladies and the bar is at the
opposite extreme  there is a long table down the centre and at either
end a stove  the washing apparatus is forward on the deck  it is a
little better than on board the canal boat but not much  in all modes
of travelling the american customs with reference to the means of
personal cleanliness and wholesome ablution are extremely negligent and
filthy and i strongly incline to the belief that a considerable amount
of illness is referable to this cause

we are to be on board the messenger three days arriving at cincinnati
(barring accidents) on monday morning  there are three meals a day
breakfast at seven dinner at half-past twelve supper about six  at
each there are a great many small dishes and plates upon the table with
very little in them so that although there is every appearance of a
mighty  spread there is seldom really more than a joint except for
those who fancy slices of beet-root shreds of dried beef complicated
entanglements of yellow pickle maize indian corn apple-sauce and
pumpkin

some people fancy all these little dainties together (and sweet preserves
beside) by way of relish to their roast pig  they are generally those
dyspeptic ladies and gentlemen who eat unheard-of quantities of hot corn
bread (almost as good for the digestion as a kneaded pin-cushion) for
breakfast and for supper  those who do not observe this custom and who
help themselves several times instead usually suck their knives and
forks meditatively until they have decided what to take next then pull
them out of their mouths put them in the dish help themselves and fall
to work again  at dinner there is nothing to drink upon the table but
great jugs full of cold water  nobody says anything at any meal to
anybody  all the passengers are very dismal and seem to have tremendous
secrets weighing on their minds  there is no conversation no laughter
no cheerfulness no sociality except in spitting and that is done in
silent fellowship round the stove when the meal is over  every man sits
down dull and languid swallows his fare as if breakfasts dinners and
suppers were necessities of nature never to be coupled with recreation
or enjoyment and having bolted his food in a gloomy silence bolts
himself in the same state  but for these animal observances you might
suppose the whole male portion of the company to be the melancholy ghosts
of departed book-keepers who had fallen dead at the desk such is their
weary air of business and calculation  undertakers on duty would be
sprightly beside them and a collation of funeral-baked meats in
comparison with these meals would be a sparkling festivity

the people are all alike too  there is no diversity of character  they
travel about on the same errands say and do the same things in exactly
the same manner and follow in the same dull cheerless round  all down
the long table there is scarcely a man who is in anything different from
his neighbour  it is quite a relief to have sitting opposite that
little girl of fifteen with the loquacious chin who to do her justice
acts up to it and fully identifies natures handwriting for of all the
small chatterboxes that ever invaded the repose of drowsy ladies cabin
she is the first and foremost  the beautiful girl who sits a little
beyond her—farther down the table there—married the young man with the
dark whiskers who sits beyond her only last month  they are going to
settle in the very far west where he has lived four years but where she
has never been  they were both overturned in a stage-coach the other day
(a bad omen anywhere else where overturns are not so common) and his
head which bears the marks of a recent wound is bound up still  she
was hurt too at the same time and lay insensible for some days bright
as her eyes are now

further down still sits a man who is going some miles beyond their place
of destination to  improve a newly-discovered copper mine  he carries
the village—that is to be—with him a few frame cottages and an
apparatus for smelting the copper  he carries its people too  they are
partly american and partly irish and herd together on the lower deck
where they amused themselves last evening till the night was pretty far
advanced by alternately firing off pistols and singing hymns

they and the very few who have been left at table twenty minutes rise
and go away  we do so too and passing through our little state-room
resume our seats in the quiet gallery without

a fine broad river always but in some parts much wider than in others
and then there is usually a green island covered with trees dividing it
into two streams  occasionally we stop for a few minutes maybe to take
in wood maybe for passengers at some small town or village (i ought to
say city every place is a city here) but the banks are for the most
part deep solitudes overgrown with trees which hereabouts are already
in leaf and very green  for miles and miles and miles these solitudes
are unbroken by any sign of human life or trace of human footstep nor is
anything seen to move about them but the blue jay whose colour is so
bright and yet so delicate that it looks like a flying flower  at
lengthened intervals a log cabin with its little space of cleared land
about it nestles under a rising ground and sends its thread of blue
smoke curling up into the sky  it stands in the corner of the poor field
of wheat which is full of great unsightly stumps like earthy
butchers-blocks  sometimes the ground is only just now cleared the
felled trees lying yet upon the soil and the log-house only this morning
begun  as we pass this clearing the settler leans upon his axe or
hammer and looks wistfully at the people from the world  the children
creep out of the temporary hut which is like a gipsy tent upon the
ground and clap their hands and shout  the dog only glances round at
us and then looks up into his masters face again as if he were
rendered uneasy by any suspension of the common business and had nothing
more to do with pleasurers  and still there is the same eternal
foreground  the river has washed away its banks and stately trees have
fallen down into the stream  some have been there so long that they are
mere dry grizzly skeletons  some have just toppled over and having
earth yet about their roots are bathing their green heads in the river
and putting forth new shoots and branches  some are almost sliding down
as you look at them  and some were drowned so long ago that their
bleached arms start out from the middle of the current and seem to try
to grasp the boat and drag it under water

through such a scene as this the unwieldy machine takes its hoarse
sullen way venting at every revolution of the paddles a loud
high-pressure blast enough one would think to waken up the host of
indians who lie buried in a great mound yonder so old that mighty oaks
and other forest trees have struck their roots into its earth and so
high that it is a hill even among the hills that nature planted round
it  the very river as though it shared ones feelings of compassion for
the extinct tribes who lived so pleasantly here in their blessed
ignorance of white existence hundreds of years ago steals out of its
way to ripple near this mound and there are few places where the ohio
sparkles more brightly than in the big grave creek

all this i see as i sit in the little stern-gallery mentioned just now
evening slowly steals upon the landscape and changes it before me when
we stop to set some emigrants ashore

five men as many women and a little girl  all their worldly goods are
a bag a large chest and an old chair one old high-backed
rush-bottomed chair a solitary settler in itself  they are rowed ashore
in the boat while the vessel stands a little off awaiting its return
the water being shallow  they are landed at the foot of a high bank on
the summit of which are a few log cabins attainable only by a long
winding path  it is growing dusk but the sun is very red and shines in
the water and on some of the tree-tops like fire

the men get out of the boat first help out the women take out the bag
the chest the chair bid the rowers  good-bye and shove the boat off
for them  at the first plash of the oars in the water the oldest woman
of the party sits down in the old chair close to the waters edge
without speaking a word  none of the others sit down though the chest
is large enough for many seats  they all stand where they landed as if
stricken into stone and look after the boat  so they remain quite
still and silent the old woman and her old chair in the centre the bag
and chest upon the shore without anybody heeding them all eyes fixed
upon the boat  it comes alongside is made fast the men jump on board
the engine is put in motion and we go hoarsely on again  there they
stand yet without the motion of a hand  i can see them through my
glass when in the distance and increasing darkness they are mere
specks to the eye lingering there still the old woman in the old chair
and all the rest about her not stirring in the least degree  and thus i
slowly lose them

the night is dark and we proceed within the shadow of the wooded bank
which makes it darker  after gliding past the sombre maze of boughs for
a long time we come upon an open space where the tall trees are burning
the shape of every branch and twig is expressed in a deep red glow and
as the light wind stirs and ruffles it they seem to vegetate in fire
it is such a sight as we read of in legends of enchanted forests saving
that it is sad to see these noble works wasting away so awfully alone
and to think how many years must come and go before the magic that
created them will rear their like upon this ground again  but the time
will come and when in their changed ashes the growth of centuries
unborn has struck its roots the restless men of distant ages will repair
to these again unpeopled solitudes and their fellows in cities far
away that slumber now perhaps beneath the rolling sea will read in
language strange to any ears in being now but very old to them of
primeval forests where the axe was never heard and where the jungled
ground was never trodden by a human foot

midnight and sleep blot out these scenes and thoughts and when the
morning shines again it gilds the house-tops of a lively city before
whose broad paved wharf the boat is moored with other boats and flags
and moving wheels and hum of men around it as though there were not a
solitary or silent rood of ground within the compass of a thousand miles

cincinnati is a beautiful city cheerful thriving and animated  i have
not often seen a place that commends itself so favourably and pleasantly
to a stranger at the first glance as this does with its clean houses of
red and white its well-paved roads and foot-ways of bright tile  nor
does it become less prepossessing on a closer acquaintance  the streets
are broad and airy the shops extremely good the private residences
remarkable for their elegance and neatness  there is something of
invention and fancy in the varying styles of these latter erections
which after the dull company of the steamboat is perfectly delightful
as conveying an assurance that there are such qualities still in
existence  the disposition to ornament these pretty villas and render
them attractive leads to the culture of trees and flowers and the
laying out of well-kept gardens the sight of which to those who walk
along the streets is inexpressibly refreshing and agreeable  i was
quite charmed with the appearance of the town and its adjoining suburb
of mount auburn from which the city lying in an amphitheatre of hills
forms a picture of remarkable beauty and is seen to great advantage

there happened to be a great temperance convention held here on the day
after our arrival and as the order of march brought the procession under
the windows of the hotel in which we lodged when they started in the
morning i had a good opportunity of seeing it  it comprised several
thousand men the members of various  washington auxiliary temperance
societies and was marshalled by officers on horseback who cantered
briskly up and down the line with scarves and ribbons of bright colours
fluttering out behind them gaily  there were bands of music too and
banners out of number and it was a fresh holiday-looking concourse
altogether

i was particularly pleased to see the irishmen who formed a distinct
society among themselves and mustered very strong with their green
scarves carrying their national harp and their portrait of father
mathew high above the peoples heads  they looked as jolly and
good-humoured as ever and working (here) the hardest for their living
and doing any kind of sturdy labour that came in their way were the most
independent fellows there i thought

the banners were very well painted and flaunted down the street
famously  there was the smiting of the rock and the gushing forth of
the waters and there was a temperate man with  considerable of a
hatchet (as the standard-bearer would probably have said) aiming a
deadly blow at a serpent which was apparently about to spring upon him
from the top of a barrel of spirits  but the chief feature of this part
of the show was a huge allegorical device borne among the
ship-carpenters on one side whereof the steamboat alcohol was
represented bursting her boiler and exploding with a great crash while
upon the other the good ship temperance sailed away with a fair wind to
the hearts content of the captain crew and passengers

after going round the town the procession repaired to a certain
appointed place where as the printed programme set forth it would be
received by the children of the different free schools  singing
temperance songs  i was prevented from getting there in time to hear
these little warblers or to report upon this novel kind of vocal
entertainment novel at least to me but i found in a large open space
each society gathered round its own banners and listening in silent
attention to its own orator  the speeches judging from the little i
could hear of them were certainly adapted to the occasion as having
that degree of relationship to cold water which wet blankets may claim
but the main thing was the conduct and appearance of the audience
throughout the day and that was admirable and full of promise

cincinnati is honourably famous for its free schools of which it has so
many that no persons child among its population can by possibility
want the means of education which are extended upon an average to four
thousand pupils annually  i was only present in one of these
establishments during the hours of instruction  in the boys department
which was full of little urchins (varying in their ages i should say
from six years old to ten or twelve) the master offered to institute an
extemporary examination of the pupils in algebra a proposal which as i
was by no means confident of my ability to detect mistakes in that
science i declined with some alarm  in the girls school reading was
proposed and as i felt tolerably equal to that art i expressed my
willingness to hear a class  books were distributed accordingly and
some half-dozen girls relieved each other in reading paragraphs from
english history  but it seemed to be a dry compilation infinitely above
their powers and when they had blundered through three or four dreary
passages concerning the treaty of amiens and other thrilling topics of
the same nature (obviously without comprehending ten words) i expressed
myself quite satisfied  it is very possible that they only mounted to
this exalted stave in the ladder of learning for the astonishment of a
visitor and that at other times they keep upon its lower rounds but i
should have been much better pleased and satisfied if i had heard them
exercised in simpler lessons which they understood

as in every other place i visited the judges here were gentlemen of high
character and attainments  i was in one of the courts for a few minutes
and found it like those to which i have already referred  a nuisance
cause was trying there were not many spectators and the witnesses
counsel and jury formed a sort of family circle sufficiently jocose
and snug

the society with which i mingled was intelligent courteous and
agreeable  the inhabitants of cincinnati are proud of their city as one
of the most interesting in america and with good reason for beautiful
and thriving as it is now and containing as it does a population of
fifty thousand souls but two-and-fifty years have passed away since the
ground on which it stands (bought at that time for a few dollars) was a
wild wood and its citizens were but a handful of dwellers in scattered
log huts upon the rivers shore




chapter xii
from cincinnati to louisville in another western steamboat and from
louisville to st louis in another  st louis


leaving cincinnati at eleven oclock in the forenoon we embarked for
louisville in the pike steamboat which carrying the mails was a packet
of a much better class than that in which we had come from pittsburg  as
this passage does not occupy more than twelve or thirteen hours we
arranged to go ashore that night not coveting the distinction of
sleeping in a state-room when it was possible to sleep anywhere else

there chanced to be on board this boat in addition to the usual dreary
crowd of passengers one pitchlynn a chief of the choctaw tribe of
indians who sent in his card to me and with whom i had the pleasure
of a long conversation

he spoke english perfectly well though he had not begun to learn the
language he told me until he was a young man grown  he had read many
books and scotts poetry appeared to have left a strong impression on
his mind especially the opening of the lady of the lake and the great
battle scene in marmion in which no doubt from the congeniality of the
subjects to his own pursuits and tastes he had great interest and
delight  he appeared to understand correctly all he had read and
whatever fiction had enlisted his sympathy in its belief had done so
keenly and earnestly  i might almost say fiercely  he was dressed in
our ordinary everyday costume which hung about his fine figure loosely
and with indifferent grace  on my telling him that i regretted not to
see him in his own attire he threw up his right arm for a moment as
though he were brandishing some heavy weapon and answered as he let it
fall again that his race were losing many things besides their dress
and would soon be seen upon the earth no more but he wore it at home he
added proudly

he told me that he had been away from his home west of the mississippi
seventeen months and was now returning  he had been chiefly at
washington on some negotiations pending between his tribe and the
government which were not settled yet (he said in a melancholy way) and
he feared never would be for what could a few poor indians do against
such well-skilled men of business as the whites?  he had no love for
washington tired of towns and cities very soon and longed for the
forest and the prairie

i asked him what he thought of congress?  he answered with a smile that
it wanted dignity in an indians eyes

he would very much like he said to see england before he died and
spoke with much interest about the great things to be seen there  when i
told him of that chamber in the british museum wherein are preserved
household memorials of a race that ceased to be thousands of years ago
he was very attentive and it was not hard to see that he had a reference
in his mind to the gradual fading away of his own people

this led us to speak of mr catlins gallery which he praised highly
observing that his own portrait was among the collection and that all
the likenesses were  elegant  mr cooper he said had painted the red
man well and so would i he knew if i would go home with him and hunt
buffaloes which he was quite anxious i should do  when i told him that
supposing i went i should not be very likely to damage the buffaloes
much he took it as a great joke and laughed heartily

he was a remarkably handsome man some years past forty i should judge
with long black hair an aquiline nose broad cheek-bones a sunburnt
complexion and a very bright keen dark and piercing eye  there were
but twenty thousand of the choctaws left he said and their number was
decreasing every day  a few of his brother chiefs had been obliged to
become civilised and to make themselves acquainted with what the whites
knew for it was their only chance of existence  but they were not many
and the rest were as they always had been  he dwelt on this and said
several times that unless they tried to assimilate themselves to their
conquerors they must be swept away before the strides of civilised
society

when we shook hands at parting i told him he must come to england as he
longed to see the land so much that i should hope to see him there one
day and that i could promise him he would be well received and kindly
treated  he was evidently pleased by this assurance though he rejoined
with a good-humoured smile and an arch shake of his head that the
english used to be very fond of the red men when they wanted their help
but had not cared much for them since

he took his leave as stately and complete a gentleman of natures
making as ever i beheld and moved among the people in the boat another
kind of being  he sent me a lithographed portrait of himself soon
afterwards very like though scarcely handsome enough which i have
carefully preserved in memory of our brief acquaintance

there was nothing very interesting in the scenery of this days journey
which brought us at midnight to louisville  we slept at the galt house
a splendid hotel and were as handsomely lodged as though we had been in
paris rather than hundreds of miles beyond the alleghanies

the city presenting no objects of sufficient interest to detain us on our
way we resolved to proceed next day by another steamboat the fulton
and to join it about noon at a suburb called portland where it would
be delayed some time in passing through a canal

the interval after breakfast we devoted to riding through the town
which is regular and cheerful the streets being laid out at right
angles and planted with young trees  the buildings are smoky and
blackened from the use of bituminous coal but an englishman is well
used to that appearance and indisposed to quarrel with it  there did
not appear to be much business stirring and some unfinished buildings
and improvements seemed to intimate that the city had been overbuilt in
the ardour of  going-a-head and was suffering under the re-action
consequent upon such feverish forcing of its powers

on our way to portland we passed a  magistrates office which amused
me as looking far more like a dame school than any police establishment
for this awful institution was nothing but a little lazy
good-for-nothing front parlour open to the street wherein two or three
figures (i presume the magistrate and his myrmidons) were basking in the
sunshine the very effigies of languor and repose  it was a perfect
picture of justice retired from business for want of customers her sword
and scales sold off napping comfortably with her legs upon the table

here as elsewhere in these parts the road was perfectly alive with pigs
of all ages lying about in every direction fast asleep or grunting
along in quest of hidden dainties  i had always a sneaking kindness for
these odd animals and found a constant source of amusement when all
others failed in watching their proceedings  as we were riding along
this morning i observed a little incident between two youthful pigs
which was so very human as to be inexpressibly comical and grotesque at
the time though i dare say in telling it is tame enough

one young gentleman (a very delicate porker with several straws sticking
about his nose betokening recent investigations in a dung-hill) was
walking deliberately on profoundly thinking when suddenly his brother
who was lying in a miry hole unseen by him rose up immediately before
his startled eyes ghostly with damp mud  never was pigs whole mass of
blood so turned  he started back at least three feet gazed for a
moment and then shot off as hard as he could go his excessively little
tail vibrating with speed and terror like a distracted pendulum  but
before he had gone very far he began to reason with himself as to the
nature of this frightful appearance and as he reasoned he relaxed his
speed by gradual degrees until at last he stopped and faced about
there was his brother with the mud upon him glazing in the sun yet
staring out of the very same hole perfectly amazed at his proceedings
he was no sooner assured of this and he assured himself so carefully
that one may almost say he shaded his eyes with his hand to see the
better than he came back at a round trot pounced upon him and
summarily took off a piece of his tail as a caution to him to be careful
what he was about for the future and never to play tricks with his
family any more

we found the steamboat in the canal waiting for the slow process of
getting through the lock and went on board where we shortly afterwards
had a new kind of visitor in the person of a certain kentucky giant whose
name is porter and who is of the moderate height of seven feet eight
inches in his stockings

there never was a race of people who so completely gave the lie to
history as these giants or whom all the chroniclers have so cruelly
libelled  instead of roaring and ravaging about the world constantly
catering for their cannibal larders and perpetually going to market in
an unlawful manner they are the meekest people in any mans
acquaintance rather inclining to milk and vegetable diet and bearing
anything for a quiet life  so decidedly are amiability and mildness
their characteristics that i confess i look upon that youth who
distinguished himself by the slaughter of these inoffensive persons as a
false-hearted brigand who pretending to philanthropic motives was
secretly influenced only by the wealth stored up within their castles
and the hope of plunder  and i lean the more to this opinion from
finding that even the historian of those exploits with all his
partiality for his hero is fain to admit that the slaughtered monsters
in question were of a very innocent and simple turn extremely guileless
and ready of belief lending a credulous ear to the most improbable
tales suffering themselves to be easily entrapped into pits and even
(as in the case of the welsh giant) with an excess of the hospitable
politeness of a landlord ripping themselves open rather than hint at
the possibility of their guests being versed in the vagabond arts of
sleight-of-hand and hocus-pocus

the kentucky giant was but another illustration of the truth of this
position  he had a weakness in the region of the knees and a
trustfulness in his long face which appealed even to five-feet nine for
encouragement and support  he was only twenty-five years old he said
and had grown recently for it had been found necessary to make an
addition to the legs of his inexpressibles  at fifteen he was a short
boy and in those days his english father and his irish mother had rather
snubbed him as being too small of stature to sustain the credit of the
family  he added that his health had not been good though it was better
now but short people are not wanting who whisper that he drinks too
hard

i understand he drives a hackney-coach though how he does it unless he
stands on the footboard behind and lies along the roof upon his chest
with his chin in the box it would be difficult to comprehend  he
brought his gun with him as a curiosity

christened  the little rifle and displayed outside a shop-window it
would make the fortune of any retail business in holborn  when he had
shown himself and talked a little while he withdrew with his
pocket-instrument and went bobbing down the cabin among men of six feet
high and upwards like a light-house walking among lamp-posts

within a few minutes afterwards we were out of the canal and in the
ohio river again

the arrangements of the boat were like those of the messenger and the
passengers were of the same order of people  we fed at the same times
on the same kind of viands in the same dull manner and with the same
observances  the company appeared to be oppressed by the same tremendous
concealments and had as little capacity of enjoyment or
light-heartedness  i never in my life did see such listless heavy
dulness as brooded over these meals the very recollection of it weighs
me down and makes me for the moment wretched  reading and writing on
my knee in our little cabin i really dreaded the coming of the hour
that summoned us to table and was as glad to escape from it again as if
it had been a penance or a punishment  healthy cheerfulness and good
spirits forming a part of the banquet i could soak my crusts in the
fountain with le sages strolling player and revel in their glad
enjoyment but sitting down with so many fellow-animals to ward off
thirst and hunger as a business to empty each creature his yahoos
trough as quickly as he can and then slink sullenly away to have these
social sacraments stripped of everything but the mere greedy satisfaction
of the natural cravings goes so against the grain with me that i
seriously believe the recollection of these funeral feasts will be a
waking nightmare to me all my life

there was some relief in this boat too which there had not been in the
other for the captain (a blunt good-natured fellow) had his handsome
wife with him who was disposed to be lively and agreeable as were a few
other lady-passengers who had their seats about us at the same end of the
table  but nothing could have made head against the depressing influence
of the general body  there was a magnetism of dulness in them which
would have beaten down the most facetious companion that the earth ever
knew  a jest would have been a crime and a smile would have faded into
a grinning horror  such deadly leaden people such systematic plodding
weary insupportable heaviness such a mass of animated indigestion in
respect of all that was genial jovial frank social or hearty never
sure was brought together elsewhere since the world began

nor was the scenery as we approached the junction of the ohio and
mississippi rivers at all inspiriting in its influence  the trees were
stunted in their growth the banks were low and flat the settlements and
log cabins fewer in number their inhabitants more wan and wretched than
any we had encountered yet  no songs of birds were in the air no
pleasant scents no moving lights and shadows from swift passing clouds
hour after hour the changeless glare of the hot unwinking sky shone
upon the same monotonous objects  hour after hour the river rolled
along as wearily and slowly as the time itself

at length upon the morning of the third day we arrived at a spot so
much more desolate than any we had yet beheld that the forlornest places
we had passed were in comparison with it full of interest  at the
junction of the two rivers on ground so flat and low and marshy that at
certain seasons of the year it is inundated to the house-tops lies a
breeding-place of fever ague and death vaunted in england as a mine of
golden hope and speculated in on the faith of monstrous
representations to many peoples ruin  a dismal swamp on which the
half-built houses rot away cleared here and there for the space of a few
yards and teeming then with rank unwholesome vegetation in whose
baleful shade the wretched wanderers who are tempted hither droop and
die and lay their bones the hateful mississippi circling and eddying
before it and turning off upon its southern course a slimy monster
hideous to behold a hotbed of disease an ugly sepulchre a grave
uncheered by any gleam of promise a place without one single quality in
earth or air or water to commend it such is this dismal cairo

but what words shall describe the mississippi great father of rivers
who (praise be to heaven) has no young children like him an enormous
ditch sometimes two or three miles wide running liquid mud six miles
an hour its strong and frothy current choked and obstructed everywhere
by huge logs and whole forest trees now twining themselves together in
great rafts from the interstices of which a sedgy lazy foam works up
to float upon the waters top now rolling past like monstrous bodies
their tangled roots showing like matted hair now glancing singly by like
giant leeches and now writhing round and round in the vortex of some
small whirlpool like wounded snakes  the banks low the trees dwarfish
the marshes swarming with frogs the wretched cabins few and far apart
their inmates hollow-cheeked and pale the weather very hot mosquitoes
penetrating into every crack and crevice of the boat mud and slime on
everything nothing pleasant in its aspect but the harmless lightning
which flickers every night upon the dark horizon

for two days we toiled up this foul stream striking constantly against
the floating timber or stopping to avoid those more dangerous obstacles
the snags or sawyers which are the hidden trunks of trees that have
their roots below the tide  when the nights are very dark the look-out
stationed in the head of the boat knows by the ripple of the water if
any great impediment be near at hand and rings a bell beside him which
is the signal for the engine to be stopped but always in the night this
bell has work to do and after every ring there comes a blow which
renders it no easy matter to remain in bed

the decline of day here was very gorgeous tingeing the firmament deeply
with red and gold up to the very keystone of the arch above us  as the
sun went down behind the bank the slightest blades of grass upon it
seemed to become as distinctly visible as the arteries in the skeleton of
a leaf and when as it slowly sank the red and golden bars upon the
water grew dimmer and dimmer yet as if they were sinking too and all
the glowing colours of departing day paled inch by inch before the
sombre night the scene became a thousand times more lonesome and more
dreary than before and all its influences darkened with the sky

we drank the muddy water of this river while we were upon it  it is
considered wholesome by the natives and is something more opaque than
gruel  i have seen water like it at the filter-shops but nowhere else

on the fourth night after leaving louisville we reached st louis and
here i witnessed the conclusion of an incident trifling enough in
itself but very pleasant to see which had interested me during the
whole journey

there was a little woman on board with a little baby and both little
woman and little child were cheerful good-looking bright-eyed and fair
to see  the little woman had been passing a long time with her sick
mother in new york and had left her home in st louis in that condition
in which ladies who truly love their lords desire to be  the baby was
born in her mothers house and she had not seen her husband (to whom she
was now returning) for twelve months having left him a month or two
after their marriage

                        [picture the little wife]

well to be sure there never was a little woman so full of hope and
tenderness and love and anxiety as this little woman was and all day
long she wondered whether  he would be at the wharf and whether  he
had got her letter and whether if she sent the baby ashore by somebody
else  he would know it meeting it in the street which seeing that he
had never set eyes upon it in his life was not very likely in the
abstract but was probable enough to the young mother  she was such an
artless little creature and was in such a sunny beaming hopeful state
and let out all this matter clinging close about her heart so freely
that all the other lady passengers entered into the spirit of it as much
as she and the captain (who heard all about it from his wife) was
wondrous sly i promise you inquiring every time we met at table as in
forgetfulness whether she expected anybody to meet her at st louis and
whether she would want to go ashore the night we reached it (but he
supposed she wouldnt) and cutting many other dry jokes of that nature
there was one little weazen dried-apple-faced old woman who took
occasion to doubt the constancy of husbands in such circumstances of
bereavement and there was another lady (with a lap-dog) old enough to
moralize on the lightness of human affections and yet not so old that
she could help nursing the baby now and then or laughing with the rest
when the little woman called it by its fathers name and asked it all
manner of fantastic questions concerning him in the joy of her heart

it was something of a blow to the little woman that when we were within
twenty miles of our destination it became clearly necessary to put this
baby to bed  but she got over it with the same good humour tied a
handkerchief round her head and came out into the little gallery with
the rest  then such an oracle as she became in reference to the
localities and such facetiousness as was displayed by the married
ladies and such sympathy as was shown by the single ones and such peals
of laughter as the little woman herself (who would just as soon have
cried) greeted every jest with

at last there were the lights of st louis and here was the wharf and
those were the steps and the little woman covering her face with her
hands and laughing (or seeming to laugh) more than ever ran into her
own cabin and shut herself up  i have no doubt that in the charming
inconsistency of such excitement she stopped her ears lest she should
hear  him asking for her but i did not see her do it

then a great crowd of people rushed on board though the boat was not
yet made fast but was wandering about among the other boats to find a
landing-place and everybody looked for the husband and nobody saw him
when in the midst of us all—heaven knows how she ever got there—there
was the little woman clinging with both arms tight round the neck of a
fine good-looking sturdy young fellow and in a moment afterwards
there she was again actually clapping her little hands for joy as she
dragged him through the small door of her small cabin to look at the
baby as he lay asleep

we went to a large hotel called the planters house built like an
english hospital with long passages and bare walls and sky-lights above
the room-doors for the free circulation of air  there were a great many
boarders in it and as many lights sparkled and glistened from the
windows down into the street below when we drove up as if it had been
illuminated on some occasion of rejoicing  it is an excellent house and
the proprietors have most bountiful notions of providing the creature
comforts  dining alone with my wife in our own room one day i counted
fourteen dishes on the table at once

in the old french portion of the town the thoroughfares are narrow and
crooked and some of the houses are very quaint and picturesque being
built of wood with tumble-down galleries before the windows
approachable by stairs or rather ladders from the street  there are
queer little barbers shops and drinking-houses too in this quarter and
abundance of crazy old tenements with blinking casements such as may be
seen in flanders  some of these ancient habitations with high garret
gable-windows perking into the roofs have a kind of french shrug about
them and being lop-sided with age appear to hold their heads askew
besides as if they were grimacing in astonishment at the american
improvements

it is hardly necessary to say that these consist of wharfs and
warehouses and new buildings in all directions and of a great many vast
plans which are still  progressing  already however some very good
houses broad streets and marble-fronted shops have gone so far ahead
as to be in a state of completion and the town bids fair in a few years
to improve considerably though it is not likely ever to vie in point of
elegance or beauty with cincinnati

the roman catholic religion introduced here by the early french
settlers prevails extensively  among the public institutions are a
jesuit college a convent for  the ladies of the sacred heart and a
large chapel attached to the college which was in course of erection at
the time of my visit and was intended to be consecrated on the second of
december in the next year  the architect of this building is one of the
reverend fathers of the school and the works proceed under his sole
direction  the organ will be sent from belgium

in addition to these establishments there is a roman catholic cathedral
dedicated to saint francis xavier and a hospital founded by the
munificence of a deceased resident who was a member of that church  it
also sends missionaries from hence among the indian tribes

the unitarian church is represented in this remote place as in most
other parts of america by a gentleman of great worth and excellence
the poor have good reason to remember and bless it for it befriends
them and aids the cause of rational education without any sectarian or
selfish views  it is liberal in all its actions of kind construction
and of wide benevolence

there are three free-schools already erected and in full operation in
this city  a fourth is building and will soon be opened

no man ever admits the unhealthiness of the place he dwells in (unless he
is going away from it) and i shall therefore i have no doubt be at
issue with the inhabitants of st louis in questioning the perfect
salubrity of its climate and in hinting that i think it must rather
dispose to fever in the summer and autumnal seasons  just adding that
it is very hot lies among great rivers and has vast tracts of undrained
swampy land around it i leave the reader to form his own opinion

as i had a great desire to see a prairie before turning back from the
furthest point of my wanderings and as some gentlemen of the town had
in their hospitable consideration an equal desire to gratify me a day
was fixed before my departure for an expedition to the looking-glass
prairie which is within thirty miles of the town  deeming it possible
that my readers may not object to know what kind of thing such a gipsy
party may be at that distance from home and among what sort of objects
it moves i will describe the jaunt in another chapter




chapter xiii
a jaunt to the looking-glass prairie and back


i may premise that the word prairie is variously pronounced paraaer
parearer paroarer  the latter mode of pronunciation is perhaps the
most in favour

we were fourteen in all and all young men indeed it is a singular
though very natural feature in the society of these distant settlements
that it is mainly composed of adventurous persons in the prime of life
and has very few grey heads among it  there were no ladies the trip
being a fatiguing one and we were to start at five oclock in the
morning punctually

i was called at four that i might be certain of keeping nobody waiting
and having got some bread and milk for breakfast threw up the window and
looked down into the street expecting to see the whole party busily
astir and great preparations going on below  but as everything was very
quiet and the street presented that hopeless aspect with which five
oclock in the morning is familiar elsewhere i deemed it as well to go
to bed again and went accordingly

i woke again at seven oclock and by that time the party had assembled
and were gathered round one light carriage with a very stout axletree
one something on wheels like an amateur carriers cart one double
phaeton of great antiquity and unearthly construction one gig with a
great hole in its back and a broken head and one rider on horseback who
was to go on before  i got into the first coach with three companions
the rest bestowed themselves in the other vehicles two large baskets
were made fast to the lightest two large stone jars in wicker cases
technically known as demi-johns were consigned to the  least rowdy of
the party for safe-keeping and the procession moved off to the
ferryboat in which it was to cross the river bodily men horses
carriages and all as the manner in these parts is

we got over the river in due course and mustered again before a little
wooden box on wheels hove down all aslant in a morass with  merchant
tailor painted in very large letters over the door  having settled the
order of proceeding and the road to be taken we started off once more
and began to make our way through an ill-favoured black hollow called
less expressively the american bottom

the previous day had been—not to say hot for the term is weak and
lukewarm in its power of conveying an idea of the temperature  the town
had been on fire in a blaze  but at night it had come on to rain in
torrents and all night long it had rained without cessation  we had a
pair of very strong horses but travelled at the rate of little more than
a couple of miles an hour through one unbroken slough of black mud and
water  it had no variety but in depth  now it was only half over the
wheels now it hid the axletree and now the coach sank down in it almost
to the windows  the air resounded in all directions with the loud
chirping of the frogs who with the pigs (a coarse ugly breed as
unwholesome-looking as though they were the spontaneous growth of the
country) had the whole scene to themselves  here and there we passed a
log hut but the wretched cabins were wide apart and thinly scattered
for though the soil is very rich in this place few people can exist in
such a deadly atmosphere  on either side of the track if it deserve the
name was the thick  bush and everywhere was stagnant slimy rotten
filthy water

as it is the custom in these parts to give a horse a gallon or so of cold
water whenever he is in a foam with heat we halted for that purpose at
a log inn in the wood far removed from any other residence  it
consisted of one room bare-roofed and bare-walled of course with a loft
above  the ministering priest was a swarthy young savage in a shirt of
cotton print like bed-furniture and a pair of ragged trousers  there
were a couple of young boys too nearly naked lying idle by the well
and they and he and the traveller at the inn turned out to look at
us

the traveller was an old man with a grey gristly beard two inches long a
shaggy moustache of the same hue and enormous eyebrows which almost
obscured his lazy semi-drunken glance as he stood regarding us with
folded arms poising himself alternately upon his toes and heels  on
being addressed by one of the party he drew nearer and said rubbing
his chin (which scraped under his horny hand like fresh gravel beneath a
nailed shoe) that he was from delaware and had lately bought a farm
 down there pointing into one of the marshes where the stunted trees
were thickest  he was  going he added to st louis to fetch his
family whom he had left behind but he seemed in no great hurry to bring
on these incumbrances for when we moved away he loitered back into the
cabin and was plainly bent on stopping there so long as his money
lasted  he was a great politician of course and explained his opinions
at some length to one of our company but i only remember that he
concluded with two sentiments one of which was somebody for ever and
the other blast everybody else which is by no means a bad abstract of
the general creed in these matters

when the horses were swollen out to about twice their natural dimensions
(there seems to be an idea here that this kind of inflation improves
their going) we went forward again through mud and mire and damp and
festering heat and brake and bush attended always by the music of the
frogs and pigs until nearly noon when we halted at a place called
belleville

belleville was a small collection of wooden houses huddled together in
the very heart of the bush and swamp  many of them had singularly bright
doors of red and yellow for the place had been lately visited by a
travelling painter  who got along as i was told  by eating his way
the criminal court was sitting and was at that moment trying some
criminals for horse-stealing with whom it would most likely go hard for
live stock of all kinds being necessarily very much exposed in the woods
is held by the community in rather higher value than human life and for
this reason juries generally make a point of finding all men indicted
for cattle-stealing guilty whether or no

the horses belonging to the bar the judge and witnesses were tied to
temporary racks set up roughly in the road by which is to be understood
a forest path nearly knee-deep in mud and slime

there was an hotel in this place which like all hotels in america had
its large dining-room for the public table  it was an odd shambling
low-roofed out-house half-cowshed and half-kitchen with a coarse brown
canvas table-cloth and tin sconces stuck against the walls to hold
candles at supper-time  the horseman had gone forward to have coffee and
some eatables prepared and they were by this time nearly ready  he had
ordered  wheat-bread and chicken fixings in preference to  corn-bread
and common doings  the latter kind of rejection includes only pork and
bacon  the former comprehends broiled ham sausages veal cutlets
steaks and such other viands of that nature as may be supposed by a
tolerably wide poetical construction  to fix a chicken comfortably in
the digestive organs of any lady or gentleman

on one of the door-posts at this inn was a tin plate whereon was
inscribed in characters of gold  doctor crocus and on a sheet of
paper pasted up by the side of this plate was a written announcement
that dr crocus would that evening deliver a lecture on phrenology for
the benefit of the belleville public at a charge for admission of so
much a head

straying up-stairs during the preparation of the chicken fixings i
happened to pass the doctors chamber and as the door stood wide open
and the room was empty i made bold to peep in

it was a bare unfurnished comfortless room with an unframed portrait
hanging up at the head of the bed a likeness i take it of the doctor
for the forehead was fully displayed and great stress was laid by the
artist upon its phrenological developments  the bed itself was covered
with an old patch-work counterpane  the room was destitute of carpet or
of curtain  there was a damp fireplace without any stove full of wood
ashes a chair and a very small table and on the last-named piece of
furniture was displayed in grand array the doctors library consisting
of some half-dozen greasy old books

now it certainly looked about the last apartment on the whole earth out
of which any man would be likely to get anything to do him good  but the
door as i have said stood coaxingly open and plainly said in
conjunction with the chair the portrait the table and the books  walk
in gentlemen walk in  dont be ill gentlemen when you may be well in
no time  doctor crocus is here gentlemen the celebrated dr crocus
dr crocus has come all this way to cure you gentlemen  if you havent
heard of dr crocus its your fault gentlemen who live a little way
out of the world here not dr crocuss  walk in gentlemen walk in

in the passage below when i went down-stairs again was dr crocus
himself  a crowd had flocked in from the court house and a voice from
among them called out to the landlord  colonel introduce doctor
crocus

 mr dickens says the colonel  doctor crocus

upon which doctor crocus who is a tall fine-looking scotchman but
rather fierce and warlike in appearance for a professor of the peaceful
art of healing bursts out of the concourse with his right arm extended
and his chest thrown out as far as it will possibly come and says

 your countryman sir

whereupon doctor crocus and i shake hands and doctor crocus looks as if
i didnt by any means realise his expectations which in a linen blouse
and a great straw hat with a green ribbon and no gloves and my face
and nose profusely ornamented with the stings of mosquitoes and the bites
of bugs it is very likely i did not

 long in these parts sir? says i

 three or four months sir says the doctor

 do you think of soon returning to the old country? says i

doctor crocus makes no verbal answer but gives me an imploring look
which says so plainly  will you ask me that again a little louder if
you please? that i repeat the question

 think of soon returning to the old country sir repeats the doctor

 to the old country sir i rejoin

doctor crocus looks round upon the crowd to observe the effect he
produces rubs his hands and says in a very loud voice

 not yet awhile sir not yet  you wont catch me at that just yet sir
i am a little too fond of freedom for that sir  ha ha  its not so
easy for a man to tear himself from a free country such as this is sir
ha ha  no no  ha ha  none of that till ones obliged to do it sir
no no

as doctor crocus says these latter words he shakes his head knowingly
and laughs again  many of the bystanders shake their heads in concert
with the doctor and laugh too and look at each other as much as to say
 a pretty bright and first-rate sort of chap is crocus and unless i am
very much mistaken a good many people went to the lecture that night
who never thought about phrenology or about doctor crocus either in all
their lives before

from belleville we went on through the same desolate kind of waste and
constantly attended without the interval of a moment by the same music
until at three oclock in the afternoon we halted once more at a
village called lebanon to inflate the horses again and give them some
corn besides of which they stood much in need  pending this ceremony i
walked into the village where i met a full-sized dwelling-house coming
down-hill at a round trot drawn by a score or more of oxen

the public-house was so very clean and good a one that the managers of
the jaunt resolved to return to it and put up there for the night if
possible  this course decided on and the horses being well refreshed
we again pushed forward and came upon the prairie at sunset

it would be difficult to say why or how—though it was possibly from
having heard and read so much about it—but the effect on me was
disappointment  looking towards the setting sun there lay stretched
out before my view a vast expanse of level ground unbroken save by one
thin line of trees which scarcely amounted to a scratch upon the great
blank until it met the glowing sky wherein it seemed to dip mingling
with its rich colours and mellowing in its distant blue  there it lay
a tranquil sea or lake without water if such a simile be admissible
with the day going down upon it a few birds wheeling here and there and
solitude and silence reigning paramount around  but the grass was not
yet high there were bare black patches on the ground and the few wild
flowers that the eye could see were poor and scanty  great as the
picture was its very flatness and extent which left nothing to the
imagination tamed it down and cramped its interest  i felt little of
that sense of freedom and exhilaration which a scottish heath inspires
or even our english downs awaken  it was lonely and wild but oppressive
in its barren monotony  i felt that in traversing the prairies i could
never abandon myself to the scene forgetful of all else as i should do
instinctively were the heather underneath my feet or an iron-bound
coast beyond but should often glance towards the distant and
frequently-receding line of the horizon and wish it gained and passed
it is not a scene to be forgotten but it is scarcely one i think (at
all events as i saw it) to remember with much pleasure or to covet the
looking-on again in after-life

we encamped near a solitary log-house for the sake of its water and
dined upon the plain  the baskets contained roast fowls buffalos
tongue (an exquisite dainty by the way) ham bread cheese and butter
biscuits champagne sherry lemons and sugar for punch and abundance of
rough ice  the meal was delicious and the entertainers were the soul of
kindness and good humour  i have often recalled that cheerful party to
my pleasant recollection since and shall not easily forget in
junketings nearer home with friends of older date my boon companions on
the prairie

returning to lebanon that night we lay at the little inn at which we had
halted in the afternoon  in point of cleanliness and comfort it would
have suffered by no comparison with any english alehouse of a homely
kind in england

rising at five oclock next morning i took a walk about the village
none of the houses were strolling about to-day but it was early for them
yet perhaps and then amused myself by lounging in a kind of farm-yard
behind the tavern of which the leading features were a strange jumble
of rough sheds for stables a rude colonnade built as a cool place of
summer resort a deep well a great earthen mound for keeping vegetables
in in winter time and a pigeon-house whose little apertures looked as
they do in all pigeon-houses very much too small for the admission of
the plump and swelling-breasted birds who were strutting about it though
they tried to get in never so hard  that interest exhausted i took a
survey of the inns two parlours which were decorated with coloured
prints of washington and president madison and of a white-faced young
lady (much speckled by the flies) who held up her gold neck-chain for
the admiration of the spectator and informed all admiring comers that
she was  just seventeen although i should have thought her older  in
the best room were two oil portraits of the kit-cat size representing
the landlord and his infant son both looking as bold as lions and
staring out of the canvas with an intensity that would have been cheap at
any price  they were painted i think by the artist who had touched up
the belleville doors with red and gold for i seemed to recognise his
style immediately

after breakfast we started to return by a different way from that which
we had taken yesterday and coming up at ten oclock with an encampment
of german emigrants carrying their goods in carts who had made a rousing
fire which they were just quitting stopped there to refresh  and very
pleasant the fire was for hot though it had been yesterday it was
quite cold to-day and the wind blew keenly  looming in the distance as
we rode along was another of the ancient indian burial-places called
the monks mound in memory of a body of fanatics of the order of la
trappe who founded a desolate convent there many years ago when there
were no settlers within a thousand miles and were all swept off by the
pernicious climate in which lamentable fatality few rational people
will suppose perhaps that society experienced any very severe
deprivation

the track of to-day had the same features as the track of yesterday
there was the swamp the bush and the perpetual chorus of frogs the
rank unseemly growth the unwholesome steaming earth  here and there
and frequently too we encountered a solitary broken-down waggon full of
some new settlers goods  it was a pitiful sight to see one of these
vehicles deep in the mire the axle-tree broken the wheel lying idly by
its side the man gone miles away to look for assistance the woman
seated among their wandering household gods with a baby at her breast a
picture of forlorn dejected patience the team of oxen crouching down
mournfully in the mud and breathing forth such clouds of vapour from
their mouths and nostrils that all the damp mist and fog around seemed
to have come direct from them

in due time we mustered once again before the merchant tailors and
having done so crossed over to the city in the ferry-boat passing on
the way a spot called bloody island the duelling-ground of st louis
and so designated in honour of the last fatal combat fought there which
was with pistols breast to breast  both combatants fell dead upon the
ground and possibly some rational people may think of them as of the
gloomy madmen on the monks mound that they were no great loss to the
community




chapter xiv
return to cincinnati  a stage-coach ride from that city to columbus and
thence to sandusky  so by lake erie to the falls of niagara


as i had a desire to travel through the interior of the state of ohio
and to  strike the lakes as the phrase is at a small town called
sandusky to which that route would conduct us on our way to niagara we
had to return from st louis by the way we had come and to retrace our
former track as far as cincinnati

the day on which we were to take leave of st louis being very fine and
the steamboat which was to have started i dont know how early in the
morning postponing for the third or fourth time her departure until
the afternoon we rode forward to an old french village on the river
called properly carondelet and nicknamed vide poche and arranged that
the packet should call for us there

the place consisted of a few poor cottages and two or three
public-houses the state of whose larders certainly seemed to justify the
second designation of the village for there was nothing to eat in any of
them  at length however by going back some half a mile or so we found
a solitary house where ham and coffee were procurable and there we
tarried to wait the advent of the boat which would come in sight from
the green before the door a long way off

it was a neat unpretending village tavern and we took our repast in a
quaint little room with a bed in it decorated with some old oil
paintings which in their time had probably done duty in a catholic
chapel or monastery  the fare was very good and served with great
cleanliness  the house was kept by a characteristic old couple with
whom we had a long talk and who were perhaps a very good sample of that
kind of people in the west

the landlord was a dry tough hard-faced old fellow (not so very old
either for he was but just turned sixty i should think) who had been
out with the militia in the last war with england and had seen all kinds
of service—except a battle and he had been very near seeing that he
added very near  he had all his life been restless and locomotive with
an irresistible desire for change and was still the son of his old self
for if he had nothing to keep him at home he said (slightly jerking his
hat and his thumb towards the window of the room in which the old lady
sat as we stood talking in front of the house) he would clean up his
musket and be off to texas to-morrow morning  he was one of the very
many descendants of cain proper to this continent who seem destined from
their birth to serve as pioneers in the great human army who gladly go
on from year to year extending its outposts and leaving home after home
behind them and die at last utterly regardless of their graves being
left thousands of miles behind by the wandering generation who succeed

his wife was a domesticated kind-hearted old soul who had come with
him  from the queen city of the world which it seemed was
philadelphia but had no love for this western country and indeed had
little reason to bear it any having seen her children one by one die
here of fever in the full prime and beauty of their youth  her heart
was sore she said to think of them and to talk on this theme even to
strangers in that blighted place so far from her old home eased it
somewhat and became a melancholy pleasure

the boat appearing towards evening we bade adieu to the poor old lady
and her vagrant spouse and making for the nearest landing-place were
soon on board the messenger again in our old cabin and steaming down
the mississippi

if the coming up this river slowly making head against the stream be an
irksome journey the shooting down it with the turbid current is almost
worse for then the boat proceeding at the rate of twelve or fifteen
miles an hour has to force its passage through a labyrinth of floating
logs which in the dark it is often impossible to see beforehand or
avoid  all that night the bell was never silent for five minutes at a
time and after every ring the vessel reeled again sometimes beneath a
single blow sometimes beneath a dozen dealt in quick succession the
lightest of which seemed more than enough to beat in her frail keel as
though it had been pie-crust  looking down upon the filthy river after
dark it seemed to be alive with monsters as these black masses rolled
upon the surface or came starting up again head first when the boat
in ploughing her way among a shoal of such obstructions drove a few
among them for the moment under water  sometimes the engine stopped
during a long interval and then before her and behind and gathering
close about her on all sides were so many of these ill-favoured
obstacles that she was fairly hemmed in the centre of a floating island
and was constrained to pause until they parted somewhere as dark clouds
will do before the wind and opened by degrees a channel out

in good time next morning however we came again in sight of the
detestable morass called cairo and stopping there to take in wood lay
alongside a barge whose starting timbers scarcely held together  it was
moored to the bank and on its side was painted  coffee house that
being i suppose the floating paradise to which the people fly for
shelter when they lose their houses for a month or two beneath the
hideous waters of the mississippi  but looking southward from this
point we had the satisfaction of seeing that intolerable river dragging
its slimy length and ugly freight abruptly off towards new orleans and
passing a yellow line which stretched across the current were again upon
the clear ohio never i trust to see the mississippi more saving in
troubled dreams and nightmares  leaving it for the company of its
sparkling neighbour was like the transition from pain to ease or the
awakening from a horrible vision to cheerful realities

we arrived at louisville on the fourth night and gladly availed
ourselves of its excellent hotel  next day we went on in the ben
franklin a beautiful mail steamboat and reached cincinnati shortly
after midnight  being by this time nearly tired of sleeping upon
shelves we had remained awake to go ashore straightway and groping a
passage across the dark decks of other boats and among labyrinths of
engine-machinery and leaking casks of molasses we reached the streets
knocked up the porter at the hotel where we had stayed before and were
to our great joy safely housed soon afterwards

we rested but one day at cincinnati and then resumed our journey to
sandusky  as it comprised two varieties of stage-coach travelling
which with those i have already glanced at comprehend the main
characteristics of this mode of transit in america i will take the
reader as our fellow-passenger and pledge myself to perform the distance
with all possible despatch

our place of destination in the first instance is columbus  it is
distant about a hundred and twenty miles from cincinnati but there is a
macadamised road (rare blessing) the whole way and the rate of
travelling upon it is six miles an hour

we start at eight oclock in the morning in a great mail-coach whose
huge cheeks are so very ruddy and plethoric that it appears to be
troubled with a tendency of blood to the head  dropsical it certainly
is for it will hold a dozen passengers inside  but wonderful to add
it is very clean and bright being nearly new and rattles through the
streets of cincinnati gaily

our way lies through a beautiful country richly cultivated and
luxuriant in its promise of an abundant harvest  sometimes we pass a
field where the strong bristling stalks of indian corn look like a crop
of walking-sticks and sometimes an enclosure where the green wheat is
springing up among a labyrinth of stumps the primitive worm-fence is
universal and an ugly thing it is but the farms are neatly kept and
save for these differences one might be travelling just now in kent

we often stop to water at a roadside inn which is always dull and
silent  the coachman dismounts and fills his bucket and holds it to the
horses heads  there is scarcely ever any one to help him there are
seldom any loungers standing round and never any stable-company with
jokes to crack  sometimes when we have changed our team there is a
difficulty in starting again arising out of the prevalent mode of
breaking a young horse which is to catch him harness him against his
will and put him in a stage-coach without further notice but we get on
somehow or other after a great many kicks and a violent struggle and
jog on as before again

occasionally when we stop to change some two or three half-drunken
loafers will come loitering out with their hands in their pockets or
will be seen kicking their heels in rocking-chairs or lounging on the
window-sill or sitting on a rail within the colonnade they have not
often anything to say though either to us or to each other but sit
there idly staring at the coach and horses  the landlord of the inn is
usually among them and seems of all the party to be the least
connected with the business of the house  indeed he is with reference to
the tavern what the driver is in relation to the coach and passengers
whatever happens in his sphere of action he is quite indifferent and
perfectly easy in his mind

the frequent change of coachmen works no change or variety in the
coachmans character  he is always dirty sullen and taciturn  if he
be capable of smartness of any kind moral or physical he has a faculty
of concealing it which is truly marvellous  he never speaks to you as
you sit beside him on the box and if you speak to him he answers (if at
all) in monosyllables  he points out nothing on the road and seldom
looks at anything being to all appearance thoroughly weary of it and
of existence generally  as to doing the honours of his coach his
business as i have said is with the horses  the coach follows because
it is attached to them and goes on wheels not because you are in it
sometimes towards the end of a long stage he suddenly breaks out into a
discordant fragment of an election song but his face never sings along
with him it is only his voice and not often that

he always chews and always spits and never encumbers himself with a
pocket-handkerchief  the consequences to the box passenger especially
when the wind blows towards him are not agreeable

whenever the coach stops and you can hear the voices of the inside
passengers or whenever any bystander addresses them or any one among
them or they address each other you will hear one phrase repeated over
and over and over again to the most extraordinary extent  it is an
ordinary and unpromising phrase enough being neither more nor less than
 yes sir but it is adapted to every variety of circumstance and fills
up every pause in the conversation  thus—

the time is one oclock at noon  the scene a place where we are to stay
and dine on this journey  the coach drives up to the door of an inn
the day is warm and there are several idlers lingering about the tavern
and waiting for the public dinner  among them is a stout gentleman in a
brown hat swinging himself to and fro in a rocking-chair on the
pavement

as the coach stops a gentleman in a straw hat looks out of the window

straw hat  (to the stout gentleman in the rocking-chair)  i reckon
thats judge jefferson ant it?

brown hat  (still swinging speaking very slowly and without any
emotion whatever)  yes sir

straw hat  warm weather judge

brown hat  yes sir

straw hat  there was a snap of cold last week

brown hat  yes sir

straw hat  yes sir

a pause  they look at each other very seriously

straw hat  i calculate youll have got through that case of the
corporation judge by this time now?

brown hat  yes sir

straw hat  how did the verdict go sir?

brown hat  for the defendant sir

straw hat  (interrogatively)  yes sir?

brown hat (affirmatively)  yes sir

both  (musingly as each gazes down the street)  yes sir

another pause  they look at each other again still more seriously than
before

brown hat  this coach is rather behind its time to-day i guess

straw hat  (doubtingly)  yes sir

brown hat  (looking at his watch)  yes sir nigh upon two hours

straw hat  (raising his eyebrows in very great surprise)  yes sir

brown hat  (decisively as he puts up his watch)  yes sir

all the other inside passengers  (among themselves)  yes sir

coachman  (in a very surly tone)  no it ant

straw hat  (to the coachman)  well i dont know sir  we were a
pretty tall time coming that last fifteen mile  thats a fact

the coachman making no reply and plainly declining to enter into any
controversy on a subject so far removed from his sympathies and feelings
another passenger says  yes sir and the gentleman in the straw hat in
acknowledgment of his courtesy says  yes sir to him in return  the
straw hat then inquires of the brown hat whether that coach in which he
(the straw hat) then sits is not a new one?  to which the brown hat
again makes answer  yes sir

straw hat  i thought so  pretty loud smell of varnish sir?

brown hat  yes sir

all the other inside passengers  yes sir

brown hat  (to the company in general)  yes sir

the conversational powers of the company having been by this time pretty
heavily taxed the straw hat opens the door and gets out and all the
rest alight also  we dine soon afterwards with the boarders in the
house and have nothing to drink but tea and coffee  as they are both
very bad and the water is worse i ask for brandy but it is a temperance
hotel and spirits are not to be had for love or money  this
preposterous forcing of unpleasant drinks down the reluctant throats of
travellers is not at all uncommon in america but i never discovered that
the scruples of such wincing landlords induced them to preserve any
unusually nice balance between the quality of their fare and their scale
of charges on the contrary i rather suspected them of diminishing the
one and exalting the other by way of recompense for the loss of their
profit on the sale of spirituous liquors  after all perhaps the
plainest course for persons of such tender consciences would be a total
abstinence from tavern-keeping

dinner over we get into another vehicle which is ready at the door (for
the coach has been changed in the interval) and resume our journey
which continues through the same kind of country until evening when we
come to the town where we are to stop for tea and supper and having
delivered the mail bags at the post-office ride through the usual wide
street lined with the usual stores and houses (the drapers always having
hung up at their door by way of sign a piece of bright red cloth) to
the hotel where this meal is prepared  there being many boarders here
we sit down a large party and a very melancholy one as usual  but
there is a buxom hostess at the head of the table and opposite a simple
welsh schoolmaster with his wife and child who came here on a
speculation of greater promise than performance to teach the classics
and they are sufficient subjects of interest until the meal is over and
another coach is ready  in it we go on once more lighted by a bright
moon until midnight when we stop to change the coach again and remain
for half an hour or so in a miserable room with a blurred lithograph of
washington over the smoky fire-place and a mighty jug of cold water on
the table to which refreshment the moody passengers do so apply
themselves that they would seem to be one and all keen patients of dr
sangrado  among them is a very little boy who chews tobacco like a very
big one and a droning gentleman who talks arithmetically and
statistically on all subjects from poetry downwards and who always
speaks in the same key with exactly the same emphasis and with very
grave deliberation  he came outside just now and told me how that the
uncle of a certain young lady who had been spirited away and married by a
certain captain lived in these parts and how this uncle was so valiant
and ferocious that he shouldnt wonder if he were to follow the said
captain to england  and shoot him down in the street wherever he found
him in the feasibility of which strong measure i being for the moment
rather prone to contradiction from feeling half asleep and very tired
declined to acquiesce assuring him that if the uncle did resort to it
or gratified any other little whim of the like nature he would find
himself one morning prematurely throttled at the old bailey and that he
would do well to make his will before he went as he would certainly want
it before he had been in britain very long

on we go all night and by-and-by the day begins to break and presently
the first cheerful rays of the warm sun come slanting on us brightly  it
sheds its light upon a miserable waste of sodden grass and dull trees
and squalid huts whose aspect is forlorn and grievous in the last
degree  a very desert in the wood whose growth of green is dank and
noxious like that upon the top of standing water where poisonous fungus
grows in the rare footprint on the oozy ground and sprouts like witches
coral from the crevices in the cabin wall and floor it is a hideous
thing to lie upon the very threshold of a city  but it was purchased
years ago and as the owner cannot be discovered the state has been
unable to reclaim it  so there it remains in the midst of cultivation
and improvement like ground accursed and made obscene and rank by some
great crime

we reached columbus shortly before seven oclock and stayed there to
refresh that day and night having excellent apartments in a very large
unfinished hotel called the neill house which were richly fitted with
the polished wood of the black walnut and opened on a handsome portico
and stone verandah like rooms in some italian mansion  the town is
clean and pretty and of course is  going to be much larger  it is the
seat of the state legislature of ohio and lays claim in consequence to
some consideration and importance

there being no stage-coach next day upon the road we wished to take i
hired  an extra at a reasonable charge to carry us to tiffin a small
town from whence there is a railroad to sandusky  this extra was an
ordinary four-horse stage-coach such as i have described changing
horses and drivers as the stage-coach would but was exclusively our own
for the journey  to ensure our having horses at the proper stations and
being incommoded by no strangers the proprietors sent an agent on the
box who was to accompany us the whole way through and thus attended
and bearing with us besides a hamper full of savoury cold meats and
fruit and wine we started off again in high spirits at half-past six
oclock next morning very much delighted to be by ourselves and
disposed to enjoy even the roughest journey

it was well for us that we were in this humour for the road we went
over that day was certainly enough to have shaken tempers that were not
resolutely at set fair down to some inches below stormy  at one time we
were all flung together in a heap at the bottom of the coach and at
another we were crushing our heads against the roof  now one side was
down deep in the mire and we were holding on to the other  now the
coach was lying on the tails of the two wheelers and now it was rearing
up in the air in a frantic state with all four horses standing on the
top of an insurmountable eminence looking coolly back at it as though
they would say  unharness us  it cant be done  the drivers on these
roads who certainly get over the ground in a manner which is quite
miraculous so twist and turn the team about in forcing a passage
corkscrew fashion through the bogs and swamps that it was quite a
common circumstance on looking out of the window to see the coachman
with the ends of a pair of reins in his hands apparently driving
nothing or playing at horses and the leaders staring at one
unexpectedly from the back of the coach as if they had some idea of
getting up behind  a great portion of the way was over what is called a
corduroy road which is made by throwing trunks of trees into a marsh
and leaving them to settle there  the very slightest of the jolts with
which the ponderous carriage fell from log to log was enough it seemed
to have dislocated all the bones in the human body  it would be
impossible to experience a similar set of sensations in any other
circumstances unless perhaps in attempting to go up to the top of st
pauls in an omnibus  never never once that day was the coach in any
position attitude or kind of motion to which we are accustomed in
coaches  never did it make the smallest approach to ones experience of
the proceedings of any sort of vehicle that goes on wheels

still it was a fine day and the temperature was delicious and though
we had left summer behind us in the west and were fast leaving spring
we were moving towards niagara and home  we alighted in a pleasant wood
towards the middle of the day dined on a fallen tree and leaving our
best fragments with a cottager and our worst with the pigs (who swarm in
this part of the country like grains of sand on the sea-shore to the
great comfort of our commissariat in canada) we went forward again
gaily

as night came on the track grew narrower and narrower until at last it
so lost itself among the trees that the driver seemed to find his way by
instinct  we had the comfort of knowing at least that there was no
danger of his falling asleep for every now and then a wheel would strike
against an unseen stump with such a jerk that he was fain to hold on
pretty tight and pretty quick to keep himself upon the box  nor was
there any reason to dread the least danger from furious driving inasmuch
as over that broken ground the horses had enough to do to walk as to
shying there was no room for that and a herd of wild elephants could
not have run away in such a wood with such a coach at their heels  so
we stumbled along quite satisfied

these stumps of trees are a curious feature in american travelling  the
varying illusions they present to the unaccustomed eye as it grows dark
are quite astonishing in their number and reality  now there is a
grecian urn erected in the centre of a lonely field now there is a woman
weeping at a tomb now a very commonplace old gentleman in a white
waistcoat with a thumb thrust into each arm-hole of his coat now a
student poring on a book now a crouching negro now a horse a dog a
cannon an armed man a hunch-back throwing off his cloak and stepping
forth into the light  they were often as entertaining to me as so many
glasses in a magic lantern and never took their shapes at my bidding
but seemed to force themselves upon me whether i would or no and
strange to say i sometimes recognised in them counterparts of figures
once familiar to me in pictures attached to childish books forgotten
long ago

it soon became too dark however even for this amusement and the trees
were so close together that their dry branches rattled against the coach
on either side and obliged us all to keep our heads within  it
lightened too for three whole hours each flash being very bright and
blue and long and as the vivid streaks came darting in among the
crowded branches and the thunder rolled gloomily above the tree tops
one could scarcely help thinking that there were better neighbourhoods at
such a time than thick woods afforded

at length between ten and eleven oclock at night a few feeble lights
appeared in the distance and upper sandusky an indian village where we
were to stay till morning lay before us

they were gone to bed at the log inn which was the only house of
entertainment in the place but soon answered to our knocking and got
some tea for us in a sort of kitchen or common room tapestried with old
newspapers pasted against the wall  the bed-chamber to which my wife
and i were shown was a large low ghostly room with a quantity of
withered branches on the hearth and two doors without any fastening
opposite to each other both opening on the black night and wild country
and so contrived that one of them always blew the other open a novelty
in domestic architecture which i do not remember to have seen before
and which i was somewhat disconcerted to have forced on my attention
after getting into bed as i had a considerable sum in gold for our
travelling expenses in my dressing-case  some of the luggage however
piled against the panels soon settled this difficulty and my sleep
would not have been very much affected that night i believe though it
had failed to do so

my boston friend climbed up to bed somewhere in the roof where another
guest was already snoring hugely  but being bitten beyond his power of
endurance he turned out again and fled for shelter to the coach which
was airing itself in front of the house  this was not a very politic
step as it turned out for the pigs scenting him and looking upon the
coach as a kind of pie with some manner of meat inside grunted round it
so hideously that he was afraid to come out again and lay there
shivering till morning  nor was it possible to warm him when he did
come out by means of a glass of brandy for in indian villages the
legislature with a very good and wise intention forbids the sale of
spirits by tavern keepers  the precaution however is quite
inefficacious for the indians never fail to procure liquor of a worse
kind at a dearer price from travelling pedlars

it is a settlement of the wyandot indians who inhabit this place  among
the company at breakfast was a mild old gentleman who had been for many
years employed by the united states government in conducting negotiations
with the indians and who had just concluded a treaty with these people
by which they bound themselves in consideration of a certain annual sum
to remove next year to some land provided for them west of the
mississippi and a little way beyond st louis  he gave me a moving
account of their strong attachment to the familiar scenes of their
infancy and in particular to the burial-places of their kindred and of
their great reluctance to leave them  he had witnessed many such
removals and always with pain though he knew that they departed for
their own good  the question whether this tribe should go or stay had
been discussed among them a day or two before in a hut erected for the
purpose the logs of which still lay upon the ground before the inn
when the speaking was done the ayes and noes were ranged on opposite
sides and every male adult voted in his turn  the moment the result was
known the minority (a large one) cheerfully yielded to the rest and
withdrew all kind of opposition

we met some of these poor indians afterwards riding on shaggy ponies
they were so like the meaner sort of gipsies that if i could have seen
any of them in england i should have concluded as a matter of course
that they belonged to that wandering and restless people

leaving this town directly after breakfast we pushed forward again over
a rather worse road than yesterday if possible and arrived about noon
at tiffin where we parted with the extra  at two oclock we took the
railroad the travelling on which was very slow its construction being
indifferent and the ground wet and marshy and arrived at sandusky in
time to dine that evening  we put up at a comfortable little hotel on
the brink of lake erie lay there that night and had no choice but to
wait there next day until a steamboat bound for buffalo appeared  the
town which was sluggish and uninteresting enough was something like the
back of an english watering-place out of the season

our host who was very attentive and anxious to make us comfortable was
a handsome middle-aged man who had come to this town from new england
in which part of the country he was  raised  when i say that he
constantly walked in and out of the room with his hat on and stopped to
converse in the same free-and-easy state and lay down on our sofa and
pulled his newspaper out of his pocket and read it at his ease i merely
mention these traits as characteristic of the country not at all as
being matter of complaint or as having been disagreeable to me  i
should undoubtedly be offended by such proceedings at home because there
they are not the custom and where they are not they would be
impertinencies but in america the only desire of a good-natured fellow
of this kind is to treat his guests hospitably and well and i had no
more right and i can truly say no more disposition to measure his
conduct by our english rule and standard than i had to quarrel with him
for not being of the exact stature which would qualify him for admission
into the queens grenadier guards  as little inclination had i to find
fault with a funny old lady who was an upper domestic in this
establishment and who when she came to wait upon us at any meal sat
herself down comfortably in the most convenient chair and producing a
large pin to pick her teeth with remained performing that ceremony and
steadfastly regarding us meanwhile with much gravity and composure (now
and then pressing us to eat a little more) until it was time to clear
away  it was enough for us that whatever we wished done was done with
great civility and readiness and a desire to oblige not only here but
everywhere else and that all our wants were in general zealously
anticipated

we were taking an early dinner at this house on the day after our
arrival which was sunday when a steamboat came in sight and presently
touched at the wharf  as she proved to be on her way to buffalo we
hurried on board with all speed and soon left sandusky far behind us

she was a large vessel of five hundred tons and handsomely fitted up
though with high-pressure engines which always conveyed that kind of
feeling to me which i should be likely to experience i think if i had
lodgings on the first-floor of a powder-mill  she was laden with flour
some casks of which commodity were stored upon the deck  the captain
coming up to have a little conversation and to introduce a friend
seated himself astride of one of these barrels like a bacchus of private
life and pulling a great clasp-knife out of his pocket began to
 whittle it as he talked by paring thin slices off the edges  and he
whittled with such industry and hearty good will that but for his being
called away very soon it must have disappeared bodily and left nothing
in its place but grist and shavings

after calling at one or two flat places with low dams stretching out
into the lake whereon were stumpy lighthouses like windmills without
sails the whole looking like a dutch vignette we came at midnight to
cleveland where we lay all night and until nine oclock next morning

i entertained quite a curiosity in reference to this place from having
seen at sandusky a specimen of its literature in the shape of a
newspaper which was very strong indeed upon the subject of lord
ashburtons recent arrival at washington to adjust the points in dispute
between the united states government and great britain informing its
readers that as america had  whipped england in her infancy and whipped
her again in her youth so it was clearly necessary that she must whip
her once again in her maturity and pledging its credit to all true
americans that if mr webster did his duty in the approaching
negotiations and sent the english lord home again in double quick time
they should within two years sing  yankee doodle in hyde park and hail
columbia in the scarlet courts of westminster  i found it a pretty
town and had the satisfaction of beholding the outside of the office of
the journal from which i have just quoted  i did not enjoy the delight
of seeing the wit who indited the paragraph in question but i have no
doubt he is a prodigious man in his way and held in high repute by a
select circle

there was a gentleman on board to whom as i unintentionally learned
through the thin partition which divided our state-room from the cabin in
which he and his wife conversed together i was unwittingly the occasion
of very great uneasiness  i dont know why or wherefore but i appeared
to run in his mind perpetually and to dissatisfy him very much  first
of all i heard him say and the most ludicrous part of the business was
that he said it in my very ear and could not have communicated more
directly with me if he had leaned upon my shoulder and whispered me
 boz is on board still my dear  after a considerable pause he added
complainingly  boz keeps himself very close which was true enough for
i was not very well and was lying down with a book  i thought he had
done with me after this but i was deceived for a long interval having
elapsed during which i imagine him to have been turning restlessly from
side to side and trying to go to sleep he broke out again with  i
suppose that boz will be writing a book by-and-by and putting all our
names in it at which imaginary consequence of being on board a boat
with boz he groaned and became silent

we called at the town of erie at eight oclock that night and lay there
an hour  between five and six next morning we arrived at buffalo where
we breakfasted and being too near the great falls to wait patiently
anywhere else we set off by the train the same morning at nine oclock
to niagara

it was a miserable day chilly and raw a damp mist falling and the
trees in that northern region quite bare and wintry  whenever the train
halted i listened for the roar and was constantly straining my eyes in
the direction where i knew the falls must be from seeing the river
rolling on towards them every moment expecting to behold the spray
within a few minutes of our stopping not before i saw two great white
clouds rising up slowly and majestically from the depths of the earth
that was all  at length we alighted and then for the first time i
heard the mighty rush of water and felt the ground tremble underneath my
feet

the bank is very steep and was slippery with rain and half-melted ice
i hardly know how i got down but i was soon at the bottom and climbing
with two english officers who were crossing and had joined me over some
broken rocks deafened by the noise half-blinded by the spray and wet
to the skin  we were at the foot of the american fall  i could see an
immense torrent of water tearing headlong down from some great height
but had no idea of shape or situation or anything but vague immensity

when we were seated in the little ferry-boat and were crossing the
swollen river immediately before both cataracts i began to feel what it
was but i was in a manner stunned and unable to comprehend the vastness
of the scene  it was not until i came on table rock and looked—great
heaven on what a fall of bright-green water—that it came upon me in its
full might and majesty

then when i felt how near to my creator i was standing the first
effect and the enduring one—instant and lasting—of the tremendous
spectacle was peace  peace of mind tranquillity calm recollections of
the dead great thoughts of eternal rest and happiness nothing of gloom
or terror  niagara was at once stamped upon my heart an image of
beauty to remain there changeless and indelible until its pulses cease
to beat for ever

oh how the strife and trouble of daily life receded from my view and
lessened in the distance during the ten memorable days we passed on that
enchanted ground  what voices spoke from out the thundering water what
faces faded from the earth looked out upon me from its gleaming depths
what heavenly promise glistened in those angels tears the drops of many
hues that showered around and twined themselves about the gorgeous
arches which the changing rainbows made

i never stirred in all that time from the canadian side whither i had
gone at first  i never crossed the river again for i knew there were
people on the other shore and in such a place it is natural to shun
strange company  to wander to and fro all day and see the cataracts
from all points of view to stand upon the edge of the great horse-shoe
fall marking the hurried water gathering strength as it approached the
verge yet seeming too to pause before it shot into the gulf below to
gaze from the rivers level up at the torrent as it came streaming down
to climb the neighbouring heights and watch it through the trees and see
the wreathing water in the rapids hurrying on to take its fearful plunge
to linger in the shadow of the solemn rocks three miles below watching
the river as stirred by no visible cause it heaved and eddied and awoke
the echoes being troubled yet far down beneath the surface by its
giant leap to have niagara before me lighted by the sun and by the
moon red in the days decline and grey as evening slowly fell upon it
to look upon it every day and wake up in the night and hear its
ceaseless voice this was enough

i think in every quiet season now still do those waters roll and leap
and roar and tumble all day long still are the rainbows spanning them
a hundred feet below  still when the sun is on them do they shine and
glow like molten gold  still when the day is gloomy do they fall like
snow or seem to crumble away like the front of a great chalk cliff or
roll down the rock like dense white smoke  but always does the mighty
stream appear to die as it comes down and always from its unfathomable
grave arises that tremendous ghost of spray and mist which is never laid
which has haunted this place with the same dread solemnity since darkness
brooded on the deep and that first flood before the deluge—light—came
rushing on creation at the word of god




chapter xv
in canada toronto kingston montreal quebec st  johns  in the
united states again lebanon the shaker village west point


i wish to abstain from instituting any comparison or drawing any
parallel whatever between the social features of the united states and
those of the british possessions in canada  for this reason i shall
confine myself to a very brief account of our journeyings in the latter
territory

but before i leave niagara i must advert to one disgusting circumstance
which can hardly have escaped the observation of any decent traveller who
has visited the falls

on table rock there is a cottage belonging to a guide where little
relics of the place are sold and where visitors register their names in
a book kept for the purpose  on the wall of the room in which a great
many of these volumes are preserved the following request is posted
 visitors will please not copy nor extract the remarks and poetical
effusions from the registers and albums kept here

but for this intimation i should have let them lie upon the tables on
which they were strewn with careful negligence like books in a
drawing-room being quite satisfied with the stupendous silliness of
certain stanzas with an anti-climax at the end of each which were framed
and hung up on the wall  curious however after reading this
announcement to see what kind of morsels were so carefully preserved i
turned a few leaves and found them scrawled all over with the vilest and
the filthiest ribaldry that ever human hogs delighted in

it is humiliating enough to know that there are among men brutes so
obscene and worthless that they can delight in laying their miserable
profanations upon the very steps of natures greatest altar  but that
these should be hoarded up for the delight of their fellow-swine and
kept in a public place where any eyes may see them is a disgrace to the
english language in which they are written (though i hope few of these
entries have been made by englishmen) and a reproach to the english
side on which they are preserved

the quarters of our soldiers at niagara are finely and airily situated
some of them are large detached houses on the plain above the falls
which were originally designed for hotels and in the evening time when
the women and children were leaning over the balconies watching the men
as they played at ball and other games upon the grass before the door
they often presented a little picture of cheerfulness and animation which
made it quite a pleasure to pass that way

at any garrisoned point where the line of demarcation between one country
and another is so very narrow as at niagara desertion from the ranks can
scarcely fail to be of frequent occurrence and it may be reasonably
supposed that when the soldiers entertain the wildest and maddest hopes
of the fortune and independence that await them on the other side the
impulse to play traitor which such a place suggests to dishonest minds
is not weakened  but it very rarely happens that the men who do desert
are happy or contented afterwards and many instances have been known in
which they have confessed their grievous disappointment and their
earnest desire to return to their old service if they could but be
assured of pardon or lenient treatment  many of their comrades
notwithstanding do the like from time to time and instances of loss of
life in the effort to cross the river with this object are far from
being uncommon  several men were drowned in the attempt to swim across
not long ago and one who had the madness to trust himself upon a table
as a raft was swept down to the whirlpool where his mangled body eddied
round and round some days

i am inclined to think that the noise of the falls is very much
exaggerated and this will appear the more probable when the depth of the
great basin in which the water is received is taken into account  at no
time during our stay there was the wind at all high or boisterous but
we never heard them three miles off even at the very quiet time of
sunset though we often tried

queenston at which place the steamboats start for toronto (or i should
rather say at which place they call for their wharf is at lewiston on
the opposite shore) is situated in a delicious valley through which the
niagara river in colour a very deep green pursues its course  it is
approached by a road that takes its winding way among the heights by
which the town is sheltered and seen from this point is extremely
beautiful and picturesque  on the most conspicuous of these heights
stood a monument erected by the provincial legislature in memory of
general brock who was slain in a battle with the american forces after
having won the victory  some vagabond supposed to be a fellow of the
name of lett who is now or who lately was in prison as a felon blew
up this monument two years ago and it is now a melancholy ruin with a
long fragment of iron railing hanging dejectedly from its top and waving
to and fro like a wild ivy branch or broken vine stem  it is of much
higher importance than it may seem that this statue should be repaired
at the public cost as it ought to have been long ago  firstly because
it is beneath the dignity of england to allow a memorial raised in honour
of one of her defenders to remain in this condition on the very spot
where he died  secondly because the sight of it in its present state
and the recollection of the unpunished outrage which brought it to this
pass is not very likely to soothe down border feelings among english
subjects here or compose their border quarrels and dislikes

i was standing on the wharf at this place watching the passengers
embarking in a steamboat which preceded that whose coming we awaited and
participating in the anxiety with which a sergeants wife was collecting
her few goods together—keeping one distracted eye hard upon the porters
who were hurrying them on board and the other on a hoopless washing-tub
for which as being the most utterly worthless of all her movables she
seemed to entertain particular affection—when three or four soldiers with
a recruit came up and went on board

the recruit was a likely young fellow enough strongly built and well
made but by no means sober indeed he had all the air of a man who had
been more or less drunk for some days  he carried a small bundle over
his shoulder slung at the end of a walking-stick and had a short pipe
in his mouth  he was as dusty and dirty as recruits usually are and his
shoes betokened that he had travelled on foot some distance but he was
in a very jocose state and shook hands with this soldier and clapped
that one on the back and talked and laughed continually like a roaring
idle dog as he was

the soldiers rather laughed at this blade than with him seeming to say
as they stood straightening their canes in their hands and looking
coolly at him over their glazed stocks  go on my boy while you may
youll know better by-and-by when suddenly the novice who had been
backing towards the gangway in his noisy merriment fell overboard before
their eyes and splashed heavily down into the river between the vessel
and the dock

i never saw such a good thing as the change that came over these soldiers
in an instant  almost before the man was down their professional
manner their stiffness and constraint were gone and they were filled
with the most violent energy  in less time than is required to tell it
they had him out again feet first with the tails of his coat flapping
over his eyes everything about him hanging the wrong way and the water
streaming off at every thread in his threadbare dress  but the moment
they set him upright and found that he was none the worse they were
soldiers again looking over their glazed stocks more composedly than
ever

the half-sobered recruit glanced round for a moment as if his first
impulse were to express some gratitude for his preservation but seeing
them with this air of total unconcern and having his wet pipe presented
to him with an oath by the soldier who had been by far the most anxious
of the party he stuck it in his mouth thrust his hands into his moist
pockets and without even shaking the water off his clothes walked on
board whistling not to say as if nothing had happened but as if he had
meant to do it and it had been a perfect success

our steamboat came up directly this had left the wharf and soon bore us
to the mouth of the niagara where the stars and stripes of america
flutter on one side and the union jack of england on the other and so
narrow is the space between them that the sentinels in either fort can
often hear the watchword of the other country given  thence we emerged
on lake ontario an inland sea and by half-past six oclock were at
toronto

the country round this town being very flat is bare of scenic interest
but the town itself is full of life and motion bustle business and
improvement  the streets are well paved and lighted with gas the
houses are large and good the shops excellent  many of them have a
display of goods in their windows such as may be seen in thriving county
towns in england and there are some which would do no discredit to the
metropolis itself  there is a good stone prison here and there are
besides a handsome church a court-house public offices many
commodious private residences and a government observatory for noting
and recording the magnetic variations  in the college of upper canada
which is one of the public establishments of the city a sound education
in every department of polite learning can be had at a very moderate
expense the annual charge for the instruction of each pupil not
exceeding nine pounds sterling  it has pretty good endowments in the way
of land and is a valuable and useful institution

the first stone of a new college had been laid but a few days before by
the governor general  it will be a handsome spacious edifice
approached by a long avenue which is already planted and made available
as a public walk  the town is well adapted for wholesome exercise at all
seasons for the footways in the thoroughfares which lie beyond the
principal street are planked like floors and kept in very good and
clean repair

it is a matter of deep regret that political differences should have run
high in this place and led to most discreditable and disgraceful
results  it is not long since guns were discharged from a window in this
town at the successful candidates in an election and the coachman of one
of them was actually shot in the body though not dangerously wounded
but one man was killed on the same occasion and from the very window
whence he received his death the very flag which shielded his murderer
(not only in the commission of his crime but from its consequences) was
displayed again on the occasion of the public ceremony performed by the
governor general to which i have just adverted  of all the colours in
the rainbow there is but one which could be so employed i need not say
that flag was orange

the time of leaving toronto for kingston is noon  by eight oclock next
morning the traveller is at the end of his journey which is performed
by steamboat upon lake ontario calling at port hope and coburg the
latter a cheerful thriving little town  vast quantities of flour form
the chief item in the freight of these vessels  we had no fewer than one
thousand and eighty barrels on board between coburg and kingston

the latter place which is now the seat of government in canada is a
very poor town rendered still poorer in the appearance of its
market-place by the ravages of a recent fire  indeed it may be said of
kingston that one half of it appears to be burnt down and the other
half not to be built up  the government house is neither elegant nor
commodious yet it is almost the only house of any importance in the
neighbourhood

there is an admirable jail here well and wisely governed and
excellently regulated in every respect  the men were employed as
shoemakers ropemakers blacksmiths tailors carpenters and
stonecutters and in building a new prison which was pretty far advanced
towards completion  the female prisoners were occupied in needlework
among them was a beautiful girl of twenty who had been there nearly
three years  she acted as bearer of secret despatches for the
self-styled patriots on navy island during the canadian insurrection
sometimes dressing as a girl and carrying them in her stays sometimes
attiring herself as a boy and secreting them in the lining of her hat
in the latter character she always rode as a boy would which was nothing
to her for she could govern any horse that any man could ride and could
drive four-in-hand with the best whip in those parts  setting forth on
one of her patriotic missions she appropriated to herself the first
horse she could lay her hands on and this offence had brought her where
i saw her  she had quite a lovely face though as the reader may
suppose from this sketch of her history there was a lurking devil in her
bright eye which looked out pretty sharply from between her prison bars

there is a bomb-proof fort here of great strength which occupies a bold
position and is capable doubtless of doing good service though the
town is much too close upon the frontier to be long held i should
imagine for its present purpose in troubled times  there is also a
small navy-yard where a couple of government steamboats were building
and getting on vigorously

we left kingston for montreal on the tenth of may at half-past nine in
the morning and proceeded in a steamboat down the st lawrence river
the beauty of this noble stream at almost any point but especially in
the commencement of this journey when it winds its way among the thousand
islands can hardly be imagined  the number and constant successions of
these islands all green and richly wooded their fluctuating sizes some
so large that for half an hour together one among them will appear as the
opposite bank of the river and some so small that they are mere dimples
on its broad bosom their infinite variety of shapes and the numberless
combinations of beautiful forms which the trees growing on them present
all form a picture fraught with uncommon interest and pleasure

in the afternoon we shot down some rapids where the river boiled and
bubbled strangely and where the force and headlong violence of the
current were tremendous  at seven oclock we reached dickensons
landing whence travellers proceed for two or three hours by stage-coach
the navigation of the river being rendered so dangerous and difficult in
the interval by rapids that steamboats do not make the passage  the
number and length of those portages over which the roads are bad and
the travelling slow render the way between the towns of montreal and
kingston somewhat tedious

our course lay over a wide uninclosed tract of country at a little
distance from the river-side whence the bright warning lights on the
dangerous parts of the st lawrence shone vividly  the night was dark
and raw and the way dreary enough  it was nearly ten oclock when we
reached the wharf where the next steamboat lay and went on board and to
bed

she lay there all night and started as soon as it was day  the morning
was ushered in by a violent thunderstorm and was very wet but gradually
improved and brightened up  going on deck after breakfast i was amazed
to see floating down with the stream a most gigantic raft with some
thirty or forty wooden houses upon it and at least as many flag-masts
so that it looked like a nautical street  i saw many of these rafts
afterwards but never one so large  all the timber or  lumber as it
is called in america which is brought down the st lawrence is floated
down in this manner  when the raft reaches its place of destination it
is broken up the materials are sold and the boatmen return for more

at eight we landed again and travelled by a stage-coach for four hours
through a pleasant and well-cultivated country perfectly french in every
respect in the appearance of the cottages the air language and dress
of the peasantry the sign-boards on the shops and taverns and the
virgins shrines and crosses by the wayside  nearly every common
labourer and boy though he had no shoes to his feet wore round his
waist a sash of some bright colour generally red and the women who
were working in the fields and gardens and doing all kinds of husbandry
wore one and all great flat straw hats with most capacious brims
there were catholic priests and sisters of charity in the village
streets and images of the saviour at the corners of cross-roads and in
other public places

at noon we went on board another steamboat and reached the village of
lachine nine miles from montreal by three oclock  there we left the
river and went on by land

montreal is pleasantly situated on the margin of the st lawrence and is
backed by some bold heights about which there are charming rides and
drives  the streets are generally narrow and irregular as in most
french towns of any age but in the more modern parts of the city they
are wide and airy  they display a great variety of very good shops and
both in the town and suburbs there are many excellent private dwellings
the granite quays are remarkable for their beauty solidity and extent

there is a very large catholic cathedral here recently erected with two
tall spires of which one is yet unfinished  in the open space in front
of this edifice stands a solitary grim-looking square brick tower
which has a quaint and remarkable appearance and which the wiseacres of
the place have consequently determined to pull down immediately  the
government house is very superior to that at kingston and the town is
full of life and bustle  in one of the suburbs is a plank road—not
footpath—five or six miles long and a famous road it is too  all the
rides in the vicinity were made doubly interesting by the bursting out of
spring which is here so rapid that it is but a days leap from barren
winter to the blooming youth of summer

the steamboats to quebec perform the journey in the night that is to
say they leave montreal at six in the evening and arrive at quebec at
six next morning  we made this excursion during our stay in montreal
(which exceeded a fortnight) and were charmed by its interest and
beauty

the impression made upon the visitor by this gibraltar of america its
giddy heights its citadel suspended as it were in the air its
picturesque steep streets and frowning gateways and the splendid views
which burst upon the eye at every turn is at once unique and lasting

it is a place not to be forgotten or mixed up in the mind with other
places or altered for a moment in the crowd of scenes a traveller can
recall  apart from the realities of this most picturesque city there
are associations clustering about it which would make a desert rich in
interest  the dangerous precipice along whose rocky front wolfe and his
brave companions climbed to glory the plains of abraham where he
received his mortal wound the fortress so chivalrously defended by
montcalm and his soldiers grave dug for him while yet alive by the
bursting of a shell are not the least among them or among the gallant
incidents of history  that is a noble monument too and worthy of two
great nations which perpetuates the memory of both brave generals and
on which their names are jointly written

the city is rich in public institutions and in catholic churches and
charities but it is mainly in the prospect from the site of the old
government house and from the citadel that its surpassing beauty lies
the exquisite expanse of country rich in field and forest
mountain-height and water which lies stretched out before the view with
miles of canadian villages glancing in long white streaks like veins
along the landscape the motley crowd of gables roofs and chimney tops
in the old hilly town immediately at hand the beautiful st lawrence
sparkling and flashing in the sunlight and the tiny ships below the rock
from which you gaze whose distant rigging looks like spiders webs
against the light while casks and barrels on their decks dwindle into
toys and busy mariners become so many puppets all this framed by a
sunken window in the fortress and looked at from the shadowed room
within forms one of the brightest and most enchanting pictures that the
eye can rest upon

in the spring of the year vast numbers of emigrants who have newly
arrived from england or from ireland pass between quebec and montreal on
their way to the backwoods and new settlements of canada  if it be an
entertaining lounge (as i very often found it) to take a morning stroll
upon the quay at montreal and see them grouped in hundreds on the public
wharfs about their chests and boxes it is matter of deep interest to be
their fellow-passenger on one of these steamboats and mingling with the
concourse see and hear them unobserved

the vessel in which we returned from quebec to montreal was crowded with
them and at night they spread their beds between decks (those who had
beds at least) and slept so close and thick about our cabin door that
the passage to and fro was quite blocked up  they were nearly all
english from gloucestershire the greater part and had had a long
winter-passage out but it was wonderful to see how clean the children
had been kept and how untiring in their love and self-denial all the
poor parents were

cant as we may and as we shall to the end of all things it is very much
harder for the poor to be virtuous than it is for the rich and the good
that is in them shines the brighter for it  in many a noble mansion
lives a man the best of husbands and of fathers whose private worth in
both capacities is justly lauded to the skies  but bring him here upon
this crowded deck  strip from his fair young wife her silken dress and
jewels unbind her braided hair stamp early wrinkles on her brow pinch
her pale cheek with care and much privation array her faded form in
coarsely patched attire let there be nothing but his love to set her
forth or deck her out and you shall put it to the proof indeed  so
change his station in the world that he shall see in those young things
who climb about his knee not records of his wealth and name but little
wrestlers with him for his daily bread so many poachers on his scanty
meal so many units to divide his every sum of comfort and farther to
reduce its small amount  in lieu of the endearments of childhood in its
sweetest aspect heap upon him all its pains and wants its sicknesses
and ills its fretfulness caprice and querulous endurance let its
prattle be not of engaging infant fancies but of cold and thirst and
hunger and if his fatherly affection outlive all this and he be
patient watchful tender careful of his childrens lives and mindful
always of their joys and sorrows then send him back to parliament and
pulpit and to quarter sessions and when he hears fine talk of the
depravity of those who live from hand to mouth and labour hard to do it
let him speak up as one who knows and tell those holders forth that
they by parallel with such a class should be high angels in their daily
lives and lay but humble siege to heaven at last

which of us shall say what he would be if such realities with small
relief or change all through his days were his  looking round upon
these people far from home houseless indigent wandering weary with
travel and hard living and seeing how patiently they nursed and tended
their young children how they consulted ever their wants first then
half supplied their own what gentle ministers of hope and faith the
women were how the men profited by their example and how very very
seldom even a moments petulance or harsh complaint broke out among them
i felt a stronger love and honour of my kind come glowing on my heart
and wished to god there had been many atheists in the better part of
human nature there to read this simple lesson in the book of life

                                * * * * *

we left montreal for new york again on the thirtieth of may crossing to
la prairie on the opposite shore of the st lawrence in a steamboat we
then took the railroad to st johns which is on the brink of lake
champlain  our last greeting in canada was from the english officers in
the pleasant barracks at that place (a class of gentlemen who had made
every hour of our visit memorable by their hospitality and friendship)
and with  rule britannia sounding in our ears soon left it far behind

but canada has held and always will retain a foremost place in my
remembrance  few englishmen are prepared to find it what it is
advancing quietly old differences settling down and being fast
forgotten public feeling and private enterprise alike in a sound and
wholesome state nothing of flush or fever in its system but health and
vigour throbbing in its steady pulse it is full of hope and promise  to
me—who had been accustomed to think of it as something left behind in the
strides of advancing society as something neglected and forgotten
slumbering and wasting in its sleep—the demand for labour and the rates
of wages the busy quays of montreal the vessels taking in their
cargoes and discharging them the amount of shipping in the different
ports the commerce roads and public works all made to last the
respectability and character of the public journals and the amount of
rational comfort and happiness which honest industry may earn were very
great surprises  the steamboats on the lakes in their conveniences
cleanliness and safety in the gentlemanly character and bearing of
their captains and in the politeness and perfect comfort of their social
regulations are unsurpassed even by the famous scotch vessels
deservedly so much esteemed at home  the inns are usually bad because
the custom of boarding at hotels is not so general here as in the states
and the british officers who form a large portion of the society of
every town live chiefly at the regimental messes but in every other
respect the traveller in canada will find as good provision for his
comfort as in any place i know

there is one american boat—the vessel which carried us on lake champlain
from st johns to whitehall—which i praise very highly but no more than
it deserves when i say that it is superior even to that in which we went
from queenston to toronto or to that in which we travelled from the
latter place to kingston or i have no doubt i may add to any other in
the world  this steamboat which is called the burlington is a
perfectly exquisite achievement of neatness elegance and order  the
decks are drawing-rooms the cabins are boudoirs choicely furnished and
adorned with prints pictures and musical instruments every nook and
corner in the vessel is a perfect curiosity of graceful comfort and
beautiful contrivance  captain sherman her commander to whose
ingenuity and excellent taste these results are solely attributable has
bravely and worthily distinguished himself on more than one trying
occasion not least among them in having the moral courage to carry
british troops at a time (during the canadian rebellion) when no other
conveyance was open to them  he and his vessel are held in universal
respect both by his own countrymen and ours and no man ever enjoyed the
popular esteem who in his sphere of action won and wore it better than
this gentleman

by means of this floating palace we were soon in the united states again
and called that evening at burlington a pretty town where we lay an
hour or so  we reached whitehall where we were to disembark at six
next morning and might have done so earlier but that these steamboats
lie by for some hours in the night in consequence of the lake becoming
very narrow at that part of the journey and difficult of navigation in
the dark  its width is so contracted at one point indeed that they are
obliged to warp round by means of a rope

after breakfasting at whitehall we took the stage-coach for albany a
large and busy town where we arrived between five and six oclock that
afternoon after a very hot days journey for we were now in the height
of summer again  at seven we started for new york on board a great north
river steamboat which was so crowded with passengers that the upper deck
was like the box lobby of a theatre between the pieces and the lower one
like tottenham court road on a saturday night  but we slept soundly
notwithstanding and soon after five oclock next morning reached new
york

tarrying here only that day and night to recruit after our late
fatigues we started off once more upon our last journey in america  we
had yet five days to spare before embarking for england and i had a
great desire to see  the shaker village which is peopled by a religious
sect from whom it takes its name

to this end we went up the north river again as far as the town of
hudson and there hired an extra to carry us to lebanon thirty miles
distant and of course another and a different lebanon from that village
where i slept on the night of the prairie trip

the country through which the road meandered was rich and beautiful the
weather very fine and for many miles the kaatskill mountains where rip
van winkle and the ghostly dutchmen played at ninepins one memorable
gusty afternoon towered in the blue distance like stately clouds  at
one point as we ascended a steep hill athwart whose base a railroad
yet constructing took its course we came upon an irish colony  with
means at hand of building decent cabins it was wonderful to see how
clumsy rough and wretched its hovels were  the best were poor
protection from the weather the worst let in the wind and rain through
wide breaches in the roofs of sodden grass and in the walls of mud some
had neither door nor window some had nearly fallen down and were
imperfectly propped up by stakes and poles all were ruinous and filthy
hideously ugly old women and very buxom young ones pigs dogs men
children babies pots kettles dung-hills vile refuse rank straw and
standing water all wallowing together in an inseparable heap composed
the furniture of every dark and dirty hut

between nine and ten oclock at night we arrived at lebanon which is
renowned for its warm baths and for a great hotel well adapted i have
no doubt to the gregarious taste of those seekers after health or
pleasure who repair here but inexpressibly comfortless to me  we were
shown into an immense apartment lighted by two dim candles called the
drawing-room from which there was a descent by a flight of steps to
another vast desert called the dining-room our bed-chambers were among
certain long rows of little white-washed cells which opened from either
side of a dreary passage and were so like rooms in a prison that i half
expected to be locked up when i went to bed and listened involuntarily
for the turning of the key on the outside  there need be baths somewhere
in the neighbourhood for the other washing arrangements were on as
limited a scale as i ever saw even in america indeed these bedrooms
were so very bare of even such common luxuries as chairs that i should
say they were not provided with enough of anything but that i bethink
myself of our having been most bountifully bitten all night

the house is very pleasantly situated however and we had a good
breakfast  that done we went to visit our place of destination which
was some two miles off and the way to which was soon indicated by a
finger-post whereon was painted  to the shaker village

as we rode along we passed a party of shakers who were at work upon the
road who wore the broadest of all broad-brimmed hats and were in all
visible respects such very wooden men that i felt about as much sympathy
for them and as much interest in them as if they had been so many
figure-heads of ships  presently we came to the beginning of the
village and alighting at the door of a house where the shaker
manufactures are sold and which is the headquarters of the elders
requested permission to see the shaker worship

pending the conveyance of this request to some person in authority we
walked into a grim room where several grim hats were hanging on grim
pegs and the time was grimly told by a grim clock which uttered every
tick with a kind of struggle as if it broke the grim silence
reluctantly and under protest  ranged against the wall were six or
eight stiff high-backed chairs and they partook so strongly of the
general grimness that one would much rather have sat on the floor than
incurred the smallest obligation to any of them

presently there stalked into this apartment a grim old shaker with
eyes as hard and dull and cold as the great round metal buttons on his
coat and waistcoat a sort of calm goblin  being informed of our desire
he produced a newspaper wherein the body of elders whereof he was a
member had advertised but a few days before that in consequence of
certain unseemly interruptions which their worship had received from
strangers their chapel was closed to the public for the space of one
year

as nothing was to be urged in opposition to this reasonable arrangement
we requested leave to make some trifling purchases of shaker goods which
was grimly conceded  we accordingly repaired to a store in the same
house and on the opposite side of the passage where the stock was
presided over by something alive in a russet case which the elder said
was a woman and which i suppose was a woman though i should not have
suspected it

on the opposite side of the road was their place of worship a cool
clean edifice of wood with large windows and green blinds like a
spacious summer-house  as there was no getting into this place and
nothing was to be done but walk up and down and look at it and the other
buildings in the village (which were chiefly of wood painted a dark red
like english barns and composed of many stories like english factories)
i have nothing to communicate to the reader beyond the scanty results i
gleaned the while our purchases were making

these people are called shakers from their peculiar form of adoration
which consists of a dance performed by the men and women of all ages
who arrange themselves for that purpose in opposite parties the men
first divesting themselves of their hats and coats which they gravely
hang against the wall before they begin and tying a ribbon round their
shirt-sleeves as though they were going to be bled  they accompany
themselves with a droning humming noise and dance until they are quite
exhausted alternately advancing and retiring in a preposterous sort of
trot  the effect is said to be unspeakably absurd and if i may judge
from a print of this ceremony which i have in my possession and which i
am informed by those who have visited the chapel is perfectly accurate
it must be infinitely grotesque

they are governed by a woman and her rule is understood to be absolute
though she has the assistance of a council of elders  she lives it is
said in strict seclusion in certain rooms above the chapel and is
never shown to profane eyes  if she at all resemble the lady who
presided over the store it is a great charity to keep her as close as
possible and i cannot too strongly express my perfect concurrence in
this benevolent proceeding

all the possessions and revenues of the settlement are thrown into a
common stock which is managed by the elders  as they have made converts
among people who were well to do in the world and are frugal and
thrifty it is understood that this fund prospers the more especially as
they have made large purchases of land  nor is this at lebanon the only
shaker settlement there are i think at least three others

they are good farmers and all their produce is eagerly purchased and
highly esteemed   shaker seeds  shaker herbs and  shaker distilled
waters are commonly announced for sale in the shops of towns and
cities  they are good breeders of cattle and are kind and merciful to
the brute creation  consequently shaker beasts seldom fail to find a
ready market

they eat and drink together after the spartan model at a great public
table  there is no union of the sexes and every shaker male and
female is devoted to a life of celibacy  rumour has been busy upon this
theme but here again i must refer to the lady of the store and say
that if many of the sister shakers resemble her i treat all such slander
as bearing on its face the strongest marks of wild improbability  but
that they take as proselytes persons so young that they cannot know
their own minds and cannot possess much strength of resolution in this
or any other respect i can assert from my own observation of the extreme
juvenility of certain youthful shakers whom i saw at work among the party
on the road

they are said to be good drivers of bargains but to be honest and just
in their transactions and even in horse-dealing to resist those thievish
tendencies which would seem for some undiscovered reason to be almost
inseparable from that branch of traffic  in all matters they hold their
own course quietly live in their gloomy silent commonwealth and show
little desire to interfere with other people

this is well enough but nevertheless i cannot i confess incline
towards the shakers view them with much favour or extend towards them
any very lenient construction  i so abhor and from my soul detest that
bad spirit no matter by what class or sect it may be entertained which
would strip life of its healthful graces rob youth of its innocent
pleasures pluck from maturity and age their pleasant ornaments and make
existence but a narrow path towards the grave that odious spirit which
if it could have had full scope and sway upon the earth must have
blasted and made barren the imaginations of the greatest men and left
them in their power of raising up enduring images before their
fellow-creatures yet unborn no better than the beasts that in these
very broad-brimmed hats and very sombre coats—in stiff-necked
solemn-visaged piety in short no matter what its garb whether it have
cropped hair as in a shaker village or long nails as in a hindoo
temple—i recognise the worst among the enemies of heaven and earth who
turn the water at the marriage feasts of this poor world not into wine
but gall  and if there must be people vowed to crush the harmless
fancies and the love of innocent delights and gaieties which are a part
of human nature as much a part of it as any other love or hope that is
our common portion let them for me stand openly revealed among the
ribald and licentious the very idiots know that they are not on the
immortal road and will despise them and avoid them readily

leaving the shaker village with a hearty dislike of the old shakers and
a hearty pity for the young ones tempered by the strong probability of
their running away as they grow older and wiser which they not
uncommonly do we returned to lebanon and so to hudson by the way we
had come upon the previous day  there we took the steamboat down the
north river towards new york but stopped some four hours journey short
of it at west point where we remained that night and all next day and
next night too

in this beautiful place the fairest among the fair and lovely highlands
of the north river shut in by deep green heights and ruined forts and
looking down upon the distant town of newburgh along a glittering path
of sunlit water with here and there a skiff whose white sail often
bends on some new tack as sudden flaws of wind come down upon her from
the gullies in the hills hemmed in besides all round with memories of
washington and events of the revolutionary war is the military school
of america

it could not stand on more appropriate ground and any ground more
beautiful can hardly be  the course of education is severe but well
devised and manly  through june july and august the young men encamp
upon the spacious plain whereon the college stands and all the year
their military exercises are performed there daily  the term of study
at this institution which the state requires from all cadets is four
years but whether it be from the rigid nature of the discipline or the
national impatience of restraint or both causes combined not more than
half the number who begin their studies here ever remain to finish them

the number of cadets being about equal to that of the members of
congress one is sent here from every congressional district its member
influencing the selection  commissions in the service are distributed on
the same principle  the dwellings of the various professors are
beautifully situated and there is a most excellent hotel for strangers
though it has the two drawbacks of being a total abstinence house (wines
and spirits being forbidden to the students) and of serving the public
meals at rather uncomfortable hours to wit breakfast at seven dinner
at one and supper at sunset

the beauty and freshness of this calm retreat in the very dawn and
greenness of summer—it was then the beginning of june—were exquisite
indeed  leaving it upon the sixth and returning to new york to embark
for england on the succeeding day i was glad to think that among the
last memorable beauties which had glided past us and softened in the
bright perspective were those whose pictures traced by no common hand
are fresh in most mens minds not easily to grow old or fade beneath
the dust of time the kaatskill mountains sleepy hollow and the tappaan
zee




chapter xvi
the passage home


i never had so much interest before and very likely i shall never have
so much interest again in the state of the wind as on the
long-looked-for morning of tuesday the seventh of june  some nautical
authority had told me a day or two previous  anything with west in it
will do so when i darted out of bed at daylight and throwing up the
window was saluted by a lively breeze from the north-west which had
sprung up in the night it came upon me so freshly rustling with so many
happy associations that i conceived upon the spot a special regard for
all airs blowing from that quarter of the compass which i shall cherish
i dare say until my own wind has breathed its last frail puff and
withdrawn itself for ever from the mortal calendar

the pilot had not been slow to take advantage of this favourable weather
and the ship which yesterday had been in such a crowded dock that she
might have retired from trade for good and all for any chance she seemed
to have of going to sea was now full sixteen miles away  a gallant
sight she was when we fast gaining on her in a steamboat saw her in
the distance riding at anchor her tall masts pointing up in graceful
lines against the sky and every rope and spar expressed in delicate and
thread-like outline gallant too when we being all aboard the anchor
came up to the sturdy chorus  cheerily men oh cheerily and she
followed proudly in the towing steamboats wake but bravest and most
gallant of all when the tow-rope being cast adrift the canvas fluttered
from her masts and spreading her white wings she soared away upon her
free and solitary course

in the after cabin we were only fifteen passengers in all and the
greater part were from canada where some of us had known each other
the night was rough and squally so were the next two days but they flew
by quickly and we were soon as cheerful and snug a party with an
honest manly-hearted captain at our head as ever came to the resolution
of being mutually agreeable on land or water

we breakfasted at eight lunched at twelve dined at three and took our
tea at half-past seven  we had abundance of amusements and dinner was
not the least among them firstly for its own sake secondly because of
its extraordinary length its duration inclusive of all the long pauses
between the courses being seldom less than two hours and a half which
was a subject of never-failing entertainment  by way of beguiling the
tediousness of these banquets a select association was formed at the
lower end of the table below the mast to whose distinguished president
modesty forbids me to make any further allusion which being a very
hilarious and jovial institution was (prejudice apart) in high favour
with the rest of the community and particularly with a black steward
who lived for three weeks in a broad grin at the marvellous humour of
these incorporated worthies

then we had chess for those who played it whist cribbage books
backgammon and shovelboard  in all weathers fair or foul calm or
windy we were every one on deck walking up and down in pairs lying in
the boats leaning over the side or chatting in a lazy group together
we had no lack of music for one played the accordion another the
violin and another (who usually began at six oclock am) the
key-bugle the combined effect of which instruments when they all played
different tunes in different parts of the ship at the same time and
within hearing of each other as they sometimes did (everybody being
intensely satisfied with his own performance) was sublimely hideous

when all these means of entertainment failed a sail would heave in
sight looming perhaps the very spirit of a ship in the misty
distance or passing us so close that through our glasses we could see
the people on her decks and easily make out her name and whither she
was bound  for hours together we could watch the dolphins and porpoises
as they rolled and leaped and dived around the vessel or those small
creatures ever on the wing the mother careys chickens which had borne
us company from new york bay and for a whole fortnight fluttered about
the vessels stern  for some days we had a dead calm or very light
winds during which the crew amused themselves with fishing and hooked
an unlucky dolphin who expired in all his rainbow colours on the deck
an event of such importance in our barren calendar that afterwards we
dated from the dolphin and made the day on which he died an era

besides all this when we were five or six days out there began to be
much talk of icebergs of which wandering islands an unusual number had
been seen by the vessels that had come into new york a day or two before
we left that port and of whose dangerous neighbourhood we were warned by
the sudden coldness of the weather and the sinking of the mercury in the
barometer  while these tokens lasted a double look-out was kept and
many dismal tales were whispered after dark of ships that had struck
upon the ice and gone down in the night but the wind obliging us to hold
a southward course we saw none of them and the weather soon grew bright
and warm again

the observation every day at noon and the subsequent working of the
vessels course was as may be supposed a feature in our lives of
paramount importance nor were there wanting (as there never are)
sagacious doubters of the captains calculations who so soon as his
back was turned would in the absence of compasses measure the chart
with bits of string and ends of pocket-handkerchiefs and points of
snuffers and clearly prove him to be wrong by an odd thousand miles or
so  it was very edifying to see these unbelievers shake their heads and
frown and hear them hold forth strongly upon navigation not that they
knew anything about it but that they always mistrusted the captain in
calm weather or when the wind was adverse  indeed the mercury itself
is not so variable as this class of passengers whom you will see when
the ship is going nobly through the water quite pale with admiration
swearing that the captain beats all captains ever known and even hinting
at subscriptions for a piece of plate and who next morning when the
breeze has lulled and all the sails hang useless in the idle air shake
their despondent heads again and say with screwed-up lips they hope
that captain is a sailor—but they shrewdly doubt him

it even became an occupation in the calm to wonder when the wind would
spring up in the favourable quarter where it was clearly shown by all
the rules and precedents it ought to have sprung up long ago  the first
mate who whistled for it zealously was much respected for his
perseverance and was regarded even by the unbelievers as a first-rate
sailor  many gloomy looks would be cast upward through the cabin
skylights at the flapping sails while dinner was in progress and some
growing bold in ruefulness predicted that we should land about the
middle of july  there are always on board ship a sanguine one and a
despondent one  the latter character carried it hollow at this period of
the voyage and triumphed over the sanguine one at every meal by
inquiring where he supposed the great western (which left new york a week
after us) was now and where he supposed the  cunard steam-packet was
now and what he thought of sailing vessels as compared with
steamships now and so beset his life with pestilent attacks of that
kind that he too was obliged to affect despondency for very peace and
quietude

these were additions to the list of entertaining incidents but there was
still another source of interest  we carried in the steerage nearly a
hundred passengers a little world of poverty and as we came to know
individuals among them by sight from looking down upon the deck where
they took the air in the daytime and cooked their food and very often
ate it too we became curious to know their histories and with what
expectations they had gone out to america and on what errands they were
going home and what their circumstances were  the information we got on
these heads from the carpenter who had charge of these people was often
of the strangest kind  some of them had been in america but three days
some but three months and some had gone out in the last voyage of that
very ship in which they were now returning home  others had sold their
clothes to raise the passage-money and had hardly rags to cover them
others had no food and lived upon the charity of the rest and one man
it was discovered nearly at the end of the voyage not before—for he kept
his secret close and did not court compassion—had had no sustenance
whatever but the bones and scraps of fat he took from the plates used in
the after-cabin dinner when they were put out to be washed

the whole system of shipping and conveying these unfortunate persons is
one that stands in need of thorough revision  if any class deserve to be
protected and assisted by the government it is that class who are
banished from their native land in search of the bare means of
subsistence  all that could be done for these poor people by the great
compassion and humanity of the captain and officers was done but they
require much more  the law is bound at least upon the english side to
see that too many of them are not put on board one ship and that their
accommodations are decent not demoralising and profligate  it is
bound too in common humanity to declare that no man shall be taken on
board without his stock of provisions being previously inspected by some
proper officer and pronounced moderately sufficient for his support upon
the voyage  it is bound to provide or to require that there be
provided a medical attendant whereas in these ships there are none
though sickness of adults and deaths of children on the passage are
matters of the very commonest occurrence  above all it is the duty of
any government be it monarchy or republic to interpose and put an end
to that system by which a firm of traders in emigrants purchase of the
owners the whole tween-decks of a ship and send on board as many
wretched people as they can lay hold of on any terms they can get
without the smallest reference to the conveniences of the steerage the
number of berths the slightest separation of the sexes or anything but
their own immediate profit  nor is even this the worst of the vicious
system for certain crimping agents of these houses who have a
percentage on all the passengers they inveigle are constantly travelling
about those districts where poverty and discontent are rife and tempting
the credulous into more misery by holding out monstrous inducements to
emigration which can never be realised

the history of every family we had on board was pretty much the same
after hoarding up and borrowing and begging and selling everything to
pay the passage they had gone out to new york expecting to find its
streets paved with gold and had found them paved with very hard and very
real stones  enterprise was dull labourers were not wanted jobs of
work were to be got but the payment was not  they were coming back
even poorer than they went  one of them was carrying an open letter from
a young english artisan who had been in new york a fortnight to a
friend near manchester whom he strongly urged to follow him  one of the
officers brought it to me as a curiosity   this is the country jem
said the writer   i like america  there is no despotism here thats
the great thing  employment of all sorts is going a-begging and wages
are capital  you have only to choose a trade jem and be it  i havent
made choice of one yet but i shall soon  at present i havent quite
made up my mind whether to be a carpenter—or a tailor

there was yet another kind of passenger and but one more who in the
calm and the light winds was a constant theme of conversation and
observation among us  this was an english sailor a smart
thorough-built english man-of-wars-man from his hat to his shoes who
was serving in the american navy and having got leave of absence was on
his way home to see his friends  when he presented himself to take and
pay for his passage it had been suggested to him that being an able
seaman he might as well work it and save the money but this piece of
advice he very indignantly rejected saying  hed be damned but for once
hed go aboard ship as a gentleman  accordingly they took his money
but he no sooner came aboard than he stowed his kit in the forecastle
arranged to mess with the crew and the very first time the hands were
turned up went aloft like a cat before anybody  and all through the
passage there he was first at the braces outermost on the yards
perpetually lending a hand everywhere but always with a sober dignity in
his manner and a sober grin on his face which plainly said  i do it as
a gentleman  for my own pleasure mind you

at length and at last the promised wind came up in right good earnest
and away we went before it with every stitch of canvas set slashing
through the water nobly  there was a grandeur in the motion of the
splendid ship as overshadowed by her mass of sails she rode at a
furious pace upon the waves which filled one with an indescribable sense
of pride and exultation  as she plunged into a foaming valley how i
loved to see the green waves bordered deep with white come rushing on
astern to buoy her upward at their pleasure and curl about her as she
stooped again but always own her for their haughty mistress still  on
on we flew with changing lights upon the water being now in the blessed
region of fleecy skies a bright sun lighting us by day and a bright
moon by night the vane pointing directly homeward alike the truthful
index to the favouring wind and to our cheerful hearts until at sunrise
one fair monday morning—the twenty-seventh of june i shall not easily
forget the day—there lay before us old cape clear god bless it
showing in the mist of early morning like a cloud the brightest and
most welcome cloud to us that ever hid the face of heavens fallen
sister—home

dim speck as it was in the wide prospect it made the sunrise a more
cheerful sight and gave to it that sort of human interest which it seems
to want at sea  there as elsewhere the return of day is inseparable
from some sense of renewed hope and gladness but the light shining on
the dreary waste of water and showing it in all its vast extent of
loneliness presents a solemn spectacle which even night veiling it in
darkness and uncertainty does not surpass  the rising of the moon is
more in keeping with the solitary ocean and has an air of melancholy
grandeur which in its soft and gentle influence seems to comfort while
it saddens  i recollect when i was a very young child having a fancy
that the reflection of the moon in water was a path to heaven trodden by
the spirits of good people on their way to god and this old feeling
often came over me again when i watched it on a tranquil night at sea

the wind was very light on this same monday morning but it was still in
the right quarter and so by slow degrees we left cape clear behind
and sailed along within sight of the coast of ireland  and how merry we
all were and how loyal to the george washington and how full of mutual
congratulations and how venturesome in predicting the exact hour at
which we should arrive at liverpool may be easily imagined and readily
understood  also how heartily we drank the captains health that day at
dinner and how restless we became about packing up and how two or three
of the most sanguine spirits rejected the idea of going to bed at all
that night as something it was not worth while to do so near the shore
but went nevertheless and slept soundly and how to be so near our
journeys end was like a pleasant dream from which one feared to wake

the friendly breeze freshened again next day and on we went once more
before it gallantly descrying now and then an english ship going
homeward under shortened sail while we with every inch of canvas
crowded on dashed gaily past and left her far behind  towards evening
the weather turned hazy with a drizzling rain and soon became so thick
that we sailed as it were in a cloud  still we swept onward like a
phantom ship and many an eager eye glanced up to where the look-out on
the mast kept watch for holyhead

at length his long-expected cry was heard and at the same moment there
shone out from the haze and mist ahead a gleaming light which presently
was gone and soon returned and soon was gone again  whenever it came
back the eyes of all on board brightened and sparkled like itself and
there we all stood watching this revolving light upon the rock at
holyhead and praising it for its brightness and its friendly warning
and lauding it in short above all other signal lights that ever were
displayed until it once more glimmered faintly in the distance far
behind us

then it was time to fire a gun for a pilot and almost before its smoke
had cleared away a little boat with a light at her masthead came bearing
down upon us through the darkness swiftly  and presently our sails
being backed she ran alongside and the hoarse pilot wrapped and
muffled in pea-coats and shawls to the very bridge of his
weather-ploughed-up nose stood bodily among us on the deck  and i think
if that pilot had wanted to borrow fifty pounds for an indefinite period
on no security we should have engaged to lend it to him among us
before his boat had dropped astern or (which is the same thing) before
every scrap of news in the paper he brought with him had become the
common property of all on board

we turned in pretty late that night and turned out pretty early next
morning  by six oclock we clustered on the deck prepared to go ashore
and looked upon the spires and roofs and smoke of liverpool  by eight
we all sat down in one of its hotels to eat and drink together for the
last time  and by nine we had shaken hands all round and broken up our
social company for ever

the country by the railroad seemed as we rattled through it like a
luxuriant garden  the beauty of the fields (so small they looked) the
hedge-rows and the trees the pretty cottages the beds of flowers the
old churchyards the antique houses and every well-known object the
exquisite delights of that one journey crowding in the short compass of
a summers day the joy of many years with the winding up with home and
all that makes it dear no tongue can tell or pen of mine describe




chapter xvii
slavery


the upholders of slavery in america—of the atrocities of which system i
shall not write one word for which i have not had ample proof and
warrant—may be divided into three great classes

the first are those more moderate and rational owners of human cattle
who have come into the possession of them as so many coins in their
trading capital but who admit the frightful nature of the institution in
the abstract and perceive the dangers to society with which it is
fraught dangers which however distant they may be or howsoever tardy in
their coming on are as certain to fall upon its guilty head as is the
day of judgment

the second consists of all those owners breeders users buyers and
sellers of slaves who will until the bloody chapter has a bloody end
own breed use buy and sell them at all hazards who doggedly deny the
horrors of the system in the teeth of such a mass of evidence as never
was brought to bear on any other subject and to which the experience of
every day contributes its immense amount who would at this or any other
moment gladly involve america in a war civil or foreign provided that
it had for its sole end and object the assertion of their right to
perpetuate slavery and to whip and work and torture slaves unquestioned
by any human authority and unassailed by any human power who when they
speak of freedom mean the freedom to oppress their kind and to be
savage merciless and cruel and of whom every man on his own ground in
republican america is a more exacting and a sterner and a less
responsible despot than the caliph haroun alraschid in his angry robe of
scarlet

the third and not the least numerous or influential is composed of all
that delicate gentility which cannot bear a superior and cannot brook an
equal of that class whose republicanism means  i will not tolerate a
man above me and of those below none must approach too near whose
pride in a land where voluntary servitude is shunned as a disgrace must
be ministered to by slaves and whose inalienable rights can only have
their growth in negro wrongs

it has been sometimes urged that in the unavailing efforts which have
been made to advance the cause of human freedom in the republic of
america (strange cause for history to treat of) sufficient regard has
not been had to the existence of the first class of persons and it has
been contended that they are hardly used in being confounded with the
second  this is no doubt the case noble instances of pecuniary and
personal sacrifice have already had their growth among them and it is
much to be regretted that the gulf between them and the advocates of
emancipation should have been widened and deepened by any means the
rather as there are beyond dispute among these slave-owners many kind
masters who are tender in the exercise of their unnatural power  still
it is to be feared that this injustice is inseparable from the state of
things with which humanity and truth are called upon to deal  slavery is
not a whit the more endurable because some hearts are to be found which
can partially resist its hardening influences nor can the indignant tide
of honest wrath stand still because in its onward course it overwhelms a
few who are comparatively innocent among a host of guilty

the ground most commonly taken by these better men among the advocates of
slavery is this  it is a bad system and for myself i would willingly
get rid of it if i could most willingly  but it is not so bad as you
in england take it to be  you are deceived by the representations of the
emancipationists  the greater part of my slaves are much attached to me
you will say that i do not allow them to be severely treated but i will
put it to you whether you believe that it can be a general practice to
treat them inhumanly when it would impair their value and would be
obviously against the interests of their masters

is it the interest of any man to steal to game to waste his health and
mental faculties by drunkenness to lie forswear himself indulge
hatred seek desperate revenge or do murder?  no  all these are roads
to ruin  and why then do men tread them? because such inclinations are
among the vicious qualities of mankind  blot out ye friends of slavery
from the catalogue of human passions brutal lust cruelty and the abuse
of irresponsible power (of all earthly temptations the most difficult to
be resisted) and when ye have done so and not before we will inquire
whether it be the interest of a master to lash and maim the slaves over
whose lives and limbs he has an absolute control

but again this class together with that last one i have named the
miserable aristocracy spawned of a false republic lift up their voices
and exclaim  public opinion is all-sufficient to prevent such cruelty as
you denounce  public opinion  why public opinion in the slave states
is slavery is it not?  public opinion in the slave states has
delivered the slaves over to the gentle mercies of their masters
public opinion has made the laws and denied the slaves legislative
protection  public opinion has knotted the lash heated the
branding-iron loaded the rifle and shielded the murderer  public
opinion threatens the abolitionist with death if he venture to the
south and drags him with a rope about his middle in broad unblushing
noon through the first city in the east  public opinion has within a
few years burned a slave alive at a slow fire in the city of st louis
and public opinion has to this day maintained upon the bench that
estimable judge who charged the jury impanelled there to try his
murderers that their most horrid deed was an act of public opinion and
being so must not be punished by the laws the public sentiment had made
public opinion hailed this doctrine with a howl of wild applause and set
the prisoners free to walk the city men of mark and influence and
station as they had been before

public opinion what class of men have an immense preponderance over the
rest of the community in their power of representing public opinion in
the legislature? the slave-owners  they send from their twelve states
one hundred members while the fourteen free states with a free
population nearly double return but a hundred and forty-two  before
whom do the presidential candidates bow down the most humbly on whom do
they fawn the most fondly and for whose tastes do they cater the most
assiduously in their servile protestations?  the slave-owners always

public opinion hear the public opinion of the free south as expressed
by its own members in the house of representatives at washington   i
have a great respect for the chair quoth north carolina  i have a
great respect for the chair as an officer of the house and a great
respect for him personally nothing but that respect prevents me from
rushing to the table and tearing that petition which has just been
presented for the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia to
pieces— i warn the abolitionists says south carolina  ignorant
infuriated barbarians as they are that if chance shall throw any of them
into our hands he may expect a felons death— let an abolitionist come
within the borders of south carolina cries a third mild carolinas
colleague  and if we can catch him we will try him and notwithstanding
the interference of all the governments on earth including the federal
government we will hang him

public opinion has made this law—it has declared that in washington in
that city which takes its name from the father of american liberty any
justice of the peace may bind with fetters any negro passing down the
street and thrust him into jail no offence on the black mans part is
necessary  the justice says  i choose to think this man a runaway and
locks him up  public opinion impowers the man of law when this is done
to advertise the negro in the newspapers warning his owner to come and
claim him or he will be sold to pay the jail fees  but supposing he is
a free black and has no owner it may naturally be presumed that he is
set at liberty  no he is sold to recompense his jailer  this has been
done again and again and again  he has no means of proving his
freedom has no adviser messenger or assistance of any sort or kind no
investigation into his case is made or inquiry instituted  he a free
man who may have served for years and bought his liberty is thrown
into jail on no process for no crime and on no pretence of crime and
is sold to pay the jail fees  this seems incredible even of america
but it is the law

public opinion is deferred to in such cases as the following which is
headed in the newspapers—

                            interesting law-case

     an interesting case is now on trial in the supreme court arising
    out of the following facts  a gentleman residing in maryland had
    allowed an aged pair of his slaves substantial though not legal
    freedom for several years  while thus living a daughter was born to
    them who grew up in the same liberty until she married a free
    negro and went with him to reside in pennsylvania  they had several
    children and lived unmolested until the original owner died when
    his heir attempted to regain them but the magistrate before whom
    they were brought decided that he had no jurisdiction in the case
    the owner seized the woman and her children in the night and
    carried them to maryland

 cash for negroes  cash for negroes  cash for negroes is the
heading of advertisements in great capitals down the long columns of the
crowded journals  woodcuts of a runaway negro with manacled hands
crouching beneath a bluff pursuer in top boots who having caught him
grasps him by the throat agreeably diversify the pleasant text  the
leading article protests against  that abominable and hellish doctrine of
abolition which is repugnant alike to every law of god and nature  the
delicate mamma who smiles her acquiescence in this sprightly writing as
she reads the paper in her cool piazza quiets her youngest child who
clings about her skirts by promising the boy  a whip to beat the little
niggers with—but the negroes little and big are protected by public
opinion

let us try this public opinion by another test which is important in
three points of view first as showing how desperately timid of the
public opinion slave-owners are in their delicate descriptions of
fugitive slaves in widely circulated newspapers secondly as showing how
perfectly contented the slaves are and how very seldom they run away
thirdly as exhibiting their entire freedom from scar or blemish or any
mark of cruel infliction as their pictures are drawn not by lying
abolitionists but by their own truthful masters

the following are a few specimens of the advertisements in the public
papers  it is only four years since the oldest among them appeared and
others of the same nature continue to be published every day in shoals

    cheek by a cut  some scars on her back

     ran away the mulatto wench mary  has a cut on the left arm a scar
    on the left shoulder and two upper teeth missing

i should say perhaps in explanation of this latter piece of
description that among the other blessings which public opinion secures
to the negroes is the common practice of violently punching out their
teeth  to make them wear iron collars by day and night and to worry
them with dogs are practices almost too ordinary to deserve mention

     ran away negro boy jack  has a small crop out of his left ear

     ran away a negro man named ivory  has a small piece cut out of
    the top of each ear

while upon the subject of ears i may observe that a distinguished
abolitionist in new york once received a negros ear which had been cut
off close to the head in a general post letter  it was forwarded by the
free and independent gentleman who had caused it to be amputated with a
polite request that he would place the specimen in his  collection

i could enlarge this catalogue with broken arms and broken legs and
gashed flesh and missing teeth and lacerated backs and bites of dogs
and brands of red-hot irons innumerable but as my readers will be
sufficiently sickened and repelled already i will turn to another branch
of the subject

these advertisements of which a similar collection might be made for
every year and month and week and day and which are coolly read in
families as things of course and as a part of the current news and
small-talk will serve to show how very much the slaves profit by public
opinion and how tender it is in their behalf  but it may be worth while
to inquire how the slave-owners and the class of society to which great
numbers of them belong defer to public opinion in their conduct not to
their slaves but to each other how they are accustomed to restrain their
passions what their bearing is among themselves whether they are fierce
or gentle whether their social customs be brutal sanguinary and
violent or bear the impress of civilisation and refinement

that we may have no partial evidence from abolitionists in this inquiry
either i will once more turn to their own newspapers and i will confine
myself this time to a selection from paragraphs which appeared from day
to day during my visit to america and which refer to occurrences
happening while i was there  the italics in these extracts as in the
foregoing are my own

these cases did not all occur it will be seen in territory actually
belonging to legalised slave states though most and those the very
worst among them did as their counterparts constantly do but the
position of the scenes of action in reference to places immediately at
hand where slavery is the law and the strong resemblance between that
class of outrages and the rest lead to the just presumption that the
character of the parties concerned was formed in slave districts and
brutalised by slave customs

                              horrible tragedy

     by a slip from the southport telegraph wisconsin we learn that
    the hon charles c p arndt member of the council for brown county
    was shot dead on the floor of the council chamber by james r
    vinyard member from grant county  the affair grew out of a
    nomination for sheriff of grant county  mr e s baker was
    nominated and supported by mr arndt  this nomination was opposed by
    vinyard who wanted the appointment to vest in his own brother  in
    the course of debate the deceased made some statements which vinyard
    pronounced false and made use of violent and insulting language
    dealing largely in personalities to which mr a made no reply
    after the adjournment mr a stepped up to vinyard and requested
    him to retract which he refused to do repeating the offensive
    words  mr arndt then made a blow at vinyard who stepped back a
    pace drew a pistol and shot him dead

     the issue appears to have been provoked on the part of vinyard who
    was determined at all hazards to defeat the appointment of baker and
    who himself defeated turned his ire and revenge upon the
    unfortunate arndt

                           the wisconsin tragedy

    public indignation runs high in the territory of wisconsin in
    relation to the murder of c c p arndt in the legislative hall of
    the territory  meetings have been held in different counties of
    wisconsin denouncing the practice of secretly bearing arms in the
    legislative chambers of the country  we have seen the account of
    the expulsion of james r vinyard the perpetrator of the bloody
    deed and are amazed to hear that after this expulsion by those who
    saw vinyard kill mr arndt in the presence of his aged father who
    was on a visit to see his son little dreaming that he was to witness
    his murder judge dunn has discharged vinyard on bail  the miners
    free press speaks in terms of merited rebuke at the outrage upon
    the feelings of the people of wisconsin  vinyard was within arms
    length of mr arndt when he took such deadly aim at him that he
    never spoke  vinyard might at pleasure being so near have only
    wounded him but he chose to kill him

                                   murder

    by a letter in a st louis paper of the  4th we notice a terrible
    outrage at burlington iowa  a mr bridgman having had a difficulty
    with a citizen of the place mr ross a brother-in-law of the latter
    provided himself with one of colts revolving pistols met mr b in
    the street and discharged the contents of five of the barrels at
    him each shot taking effect  mr b though horribly wounded
    and dying returned the fire and killed ross on the spot

                      terrible death of robert potter

     from the “caddo gazette” of the 12th inst we learn the frightful
    death of colonel robert potter    he was beset in his house by an
    enemy named rose  he sprang from his couch seized his gun and in
    his night-clothes rushed from the house  for about two hundred
    yards his speed seemed to defy his pursuers but getting entangled
    in a thicket he was captured  rose told him that he intended to
    act a generous part and give him a chance for his life  he then
    told potter he might run and he should not be interrupted till he
    reached a certain distance  potter started at the word of command
    and before a gun was fired he had reached the lake  his first
    impulse was to jump in the water and dive for it which he did  rose
    was close behind him and formed his men on the bank ready to shoot
    him as he rose  in a few seconds he came up to breathe and scarce
    had his head reached the surface of the water when it was completely
    riddled with the shot of their guns and he sunk to rise no more

                             murder in arkansas

     we understand that a severe rencontre came off a few days since in
    the seneca nation between mr loose the sub-agent of the mixed band
    of the senecas quapaw and shawnees and mr james gillespie of the
    mercantile firm of thomas g allison and co of maysville benton
    county ark in which the latter was slain with a bowie-knife  some
    difficulty had for some time existed between the parties  it is said
    that major gillespie brought on the attack with a cane  a severe
    conflict ensued during which two pistols were fired by gillespie and
    one by loose  loose then stabbed gillespie with one of those
    never-failing weapons a bowie-knife  the death of major g is much
    regretted as he was a liberal-minded and energetic man  since the
    above was in type we have learned that major allison has stated to
    some of our citizens in town that mr loose gave the first blow  we
    forbear to give any particulars as the matter will be the subject
    of judicial investigation

                                 foul deed

    the steamer thames just from missouri river brought us a handbill
    offering a reward of 500 dollars for the person who assassinated
    lilburn w baggs late governor of this state at independence on
    the night of the 6th inst  governor baggs it is stated in a written
    memorandum was not dead but mortally wounded

     since the above was written we received a note from the clerk of
    the thames giving the following particulars  gov baggs was shot by
    some villain on friday 6th inst in the evening while sitting in a
    room in his own house in independence  his son a boy hearing a
    report ran into the room and found the governor sitting in his
    chair with his jaw fallen down and his head leaning back on
    discovering the injury done to his father he gave the alarm  foot
    tracks were found in the garden below the window and a pistol picked
    up supposed to have been overloaded and thrown from the hand of the
    scoundrel who fired it  three buck shots of a heavy load took
    effect one going through his mouth one into the brain and another
    probably in or near the brain all going into the back part of the
    neck and head  the governor was still alive on the morning of the
    7th but no hopes for his recovery by his friends and but slight
    hopes from his physicians

     a man was suspected and the sheriff most probably has possession of
    him by this time

     the pistol was one of a pair stolen some days previous from a baker
    in independence and the legal authorities have the description of
    the other

                                 rencontre

     an unfortunate affair took place on friday evening in chatres
    street in which one of our most respectable citizens received a
    dangerous wound from a poignard in the abdomen  from the bee (new
    orleans) of yesterday we learn the following particulars  it
    appears that an article was published in the french side of the paper
    on monday last containing some strictures on the artillery battalion
    for firing their guns on sunday morning in answer to those from the
    ontario and woodbury and thereby much alarm was caused to the
    families of those persons who were out all night preserving the peace
    of the city  major c gally commander of the battalion resenting
    this called at the office and demanded the authors name that of
    mr p arpin was given to him who was absent at the time  some
    angry words then passed with one of the proprietors and a challenge
    followed the friends of both parties tried to arrange the affair
    but failed to do so  on friday evening about seven oclock major
    gally met mr p arpin in chatres street and accosted him  “are you
    mr arpin?”

     “yes sir”

     “then i have to tell you that you are a—” (applying an appropriate
    epithet)

     “i shall remind you of your words sir”

     “but i have said i would break my cane on your shoulders”

     “i know it but i have not yet received the blow”

     at these words major gally having a cane in his hands struck mr
    arpin across the face and the latter drew a poignard from his pocket
    and stabbed major gally in the abdomen

     fears are entertained that the wound will be mortal  we understand
    that mr arpin has given security for his appearance at the criminal
    court to answer the charge

                           affray in mississippi

     on the 27th ult in an affray near carthage leake county
    mississippi between james cottingham and john wilburn the latter
    was shot by the former and so horribly wounded that there was no
    hope of his recovery  on the 2nd instant there was an affray at
    carthage between a c sharkey and george goff in which the latter
    was shot and thought mortally wounded  sharkey delivered himself up
    to the authorities but changed his mind and escaped

                             personal encounter

     an encounter took place in sparta a few days since between the
    barkeeper of an hotel and a man named bury  it appears that bury
    had become somewhat noisy and that the barkeeper determined to
    preserve order had threatened to shoot bury whereupon bury drew
    a pistol and shot the barkeeper down  he was not dead at the last
    accounts but slight hopes were entertained of his recovery

                                    duel

     the clerk of the steamboat tribune informs us that another duel
    was fought on tuesday last by mr robbins a bank officer in
    vicksburg and mr fall the editor of the vicksburg sentinel
    according to the arrangement the parties had six pistols each
    which after the word “fire” they were to discharge as fast as they
    pleased  fall fired two pistols without effect  mr robbins first
    shot took effect in falls thigh who fell and was unable to
    continue the combat

                          affray in clarke county

     an unfortunate affray occurred in clarke county (mo) near
    waterloo on tuesday the 19th ult which originated in settling the
    partnership concerns of messrs m kane and m allister who had been
    engaged in the business of distilling and resulted in the death of
    the latter who was shot down by mr m kane because of his
    attempting to take possession of seven barrels of whiskey the
    property of m kane which had been knocked off to m allister at a
    sheriffs sale at one dollar per barrel  m kane immediately fled
    and at the latest dates had not been taken

     this unfortunate affray caused considerable excitement in the
    neighbourhood as both the parties were men with large families
    depending upon them and stood well in the community

i will quote but one more paragraph which by reason of its monstrous
absurdity may be a relief to these atrocious deeds

                              affair of honour

     we have just heard the particulars of a meeting which took place on
    six mile island on tuesday between two young bloods of our city
    samuel thurston aged fifteen and william hine aged thirteen
    years  they were attended by young gentlemen of the same age  the
    weapons used on the occasion were a couple of dicksons best rifles
    the distance thirty yards  they took one fire without any damage
    being sustained by either party except the ball of thurstons gun
    passing through the crown of hines hat  through the intercession
    of the board of honour the challenge was withdrawn and the
    difference amicably adjusted

if the reader will picture to himself the kind of board of honour which
amicably adjusted the difference between these two little boys who in
any other part of the world would have been amicably adjusted on two
porters backs and soundly flogged with birchen rods he will be
possessed no doubt with as strong a sense of its ludicrous character
as that which sets me laughing whenever its image rises up before me

now i appeal to every human mind imbued with the commonest of common
sense and the commonest of common humanity to all dispassionate
reasoning creatures of any shade of opinion and ask with these
revolting evidences of the state of society which exists in and about the
slave districts of america before them can they have a doubt of the real
condition of the slave or can they for a moment make a compromise
between the institution or any of its flagrant fearful features and
their own just consciences? will they say of any tale of cruelty and
horror however aggravated in degree that it is improbable when they
can turn to the public prints and running read such signs as these
laid before them by the men who rule the slaves in their own acts and
under their own hands?

do we not know that the worst deformity and ugliness of slavery are at
once the cause and the effect of the reckless license taken by these
freeborn outlaws?  do we not know that the man who has been born and bred
among its wrongs who has seen in his childhood husbands obliged at the
word of command to flog their wives women indecently compelled to hold
up their own garments that men might lay the heavier stripes upon their
legs driven and harried by brutal overseers in their time of travail
and becoming mothers on the field of toil under the very lash itself
who has read in youth and seen his virgin sisters read descriptions of
runaway men and women and their disfigured persons which could not be
published elsewhere of so much stock upon a farm or at a show of
beasts—do we not know that that man whenever his wrath is kindled up
will be a brutal savage?  do we not know that as he is a coward in his
domestic life stalking among his shrinking men and women slaves armed
with his heavy whip so he will be a coward out of doors and carrying
cowards weapons hidden in his breast will shoot men down and stab them
when he quarrels?  and if our reason did not teach us this and much
beyond if we were such idiots as to close our eyes to that fine mode of
training which rears up such men should we not know that they who among
their equals stab and pistol in the legislative halls and in the
counting-house and on the marketplace and in all the elsewhere peaceful
pursuits of life must be to their dependants even though they were free
servants so many merciless and unrelenting tyrants?

what shall we declaim against the ignorant peasantry of ireland and
mince the matter when these american taskmasters are in question?  shall
we cry shame on the brutality of those who hamstring cattle and spare
the lights of freedom upon earth who notch the ears of men and women cut
pleasant posies in the shrinking flesh learn to write with pens of
red-hot iron on the human face rack their poetic fancies for liveries of
mutilation which their slaves shall wear for life and carry to the grave
breaking living limbs as did the soldiery who mocked and slew the saviour
of the world and set defenceless creatures up for targets shall we
whimper over legends of the tortures practised on each other by the pagan
indians and smile upon the cruelties of christian men  shall we so
long as these things last exult above the scattered remnants of that
race and triumph in the white enjoyment of their possessions?  rather
for me restore the forest and the indian village in lieu of stars and
stripes let some poor feather flutter in the breeze replace the streets
and squares by wigwams and though the death-song of a hundred haughty
warriors fill the air it will be music to the shriek of one unhappy
slave

on one theme which is commonly before our eyes and in respect of which
our national character is changing fast let the plain truth be spoken
and let us not like dastards beat about the bush by hinting at the
spaniard and the fierce italian  when knives are drawn by englishmen in
conflict let it be said and known  we owe this change to republican
slavery  these are the weapons of freedom  with sharp points and edges
such as these liberty in america hews and hacks her slaves or failing
that pursuit her sons devote them to a better use and turn them on each
other




chapter xviii
concluding remarks


there are many passages in this book where i have been at some pains to
resist the temptation of troubling my readers with my own deductions and
conclusions preferring that they should judge for themselves from such
premises as i have laid before them  my only object in the outset was
to carry them with me faithfully wheresoever i went and that task i have
discharged

but i may be pardoned if on such a theme as the general character of the
american people and the general character of their social system as
presented to a strangers eyes i desire to express my own opinions in a
few words before i bring these volumes to a close

they are by nature frank brave cordial hospitable and affectionate
cultivation and refinement seem but to enhance their warmth of heart and
ardent enthusiasm and it is the possession of these latter qualities in
a most remarkable degree which renders an educated american one of the
most endearing and most generous of friends  i never was so won upon as
by this class never yielded up my full confidence and esteem so readily
and pleasurably as to them never can make again in half a year so
many friends for whom i seem to entertain the regard of half a life

these qualities are natural i implicitly believe to the whole people
that they are however sadly sapped and blighted in their growth among
the mass and that there are influences at work which endanger them still
more and give but little present promise of their healthy restoration
is a truth that ought to be told

it is an essential part of every national character to pique itself
mightily upon its faults and to deduce tokens of its virtue or its
wisdom from their very exaggeration  one great blemish in the popular
mind of america and the prolific parent of an innumerable brood of
evils is universal distrust  yet the american citizen plumes himself
upon this spirit even when he is sufficiently dispassionate to perceive
the ruin it works and will often adduce it in spite of his own reason
as an instance of the great sagacity and acuteness of the people and
their superior shrewdness and independence

 you carry says the stranger  this jealousy and distrust into every
transaction of public life  by repelling worthy men from your
legislative assemblies it has bred up a class of candidates for the
suffrage who in their very act disgrace your institutions and your
peoples choice  it has rendered you so fickle and so given to change
that your inconstancy has passed into a proverb for you no sooner set up
an idol firmly than you are sure to pull it down and dash it into
fragments and this because directly you reward a benefactor or a
public servant you distrust him merely because he is rewarded and
immediately apply yourselves to find out either that you have been too
bountiful in your acknowledgments or he remiss in his deserts  any man
who attains a high place among you from the president downwards may
date his downfall from that moment for any printed lie that any
notorious villain pens although it militate directly against the
character and conduct of a life appeals at once to your distrust and is
believed  you will strain at a gnat in the way of trustfulness and
confidence however fairly won and well deserved but you will swallow a
whole caravan of camels if they be laden with unworthy doubts and mean
suspicions  is this well think you or likely to elevate the character
of the governors or the governed among you?

the answer is invariably the same  theres freedom of opinion here you
know  every man thinks for himself and we are not to be easily
overreached  thats how our people come to be suspicious

another prominent feature is the love of  smart dealing which gilds
over many a swindle and gross breach of trust many a defalcation public
and private and enables many a knave to hold his head up with the best
who well deserves a halter though it has not been without its
retributive operation for this smartness has done more in a few years to
impair the public credit and to cripple the public resources than dull
honesty however rash could have effected in a century  the merits of a
broken speculation or a bankruptcy or of a successful scoundrel are
not gauged by its or his observance of the golden rule  do as you would
be done by but are considered with reference to their smartness  i
recollect on both occasions of our passing that ill-fated cairo on the
mississippi remarking on the bad effects such gross deceits must have
when they exploded in generating a want of confidence abroad and
discouraging foreign investment but i was given to understand that this
was a very smart scheme by which a deal of money had been made and that
its smartest feature was that they forgot these things abroad in a very
short time and speculated again as freely as ever  the following
dialogue i have held a hundred times  is it not a very disgraceful
circumstance that such a man as so-and-so should be acquiring a large
property by the most infamous and odious means and notwithstanding all
the crimes of which he has been guilty should be tolerated and abetted
by your citizens?  he is a public nuisance is he not?   yes sir   a
convicted liar?   yes sir   he has been kicked and cuffed and
caned?   yes sir   and he is utterly dishonourable debased and
profligate?   yes sir   in the name of wonder then what is his
merit?   well sir he is a smart man

in like manner all kinds of deficient and impolitic usages are referred
to the national love of trade though oddly enough it would be a
weighty charge against a foreigner that he regarded the americans as a
trading people  the love of trade is assigned as a reason for that
comfortless custom so very prevalent in country towns of married
persons living in hotels having no fireside of their own and seldom
meeting from early morning until late at night but at the hasty public
meals  the love of trade is a reason why the literature of america is to
remain for ever unprotected  for we are a trading people and dont care
for poetry though we do by the way profess to be very proud of our
poets while healthful amusements cheerful means of recreation and
wholesome fancies must fade before the stern utilitarian joys of trade

these three characteristics are strongly presented at every turn full in
the strangers view  but the foul growth of america has a more tangled
root than this and it strikes its fibres deep in its licentious press

schools may be erected east west north and south pupils be taught
and masters reared by scores upon scores of thousands colleges may
thrive churches may be crammed temperance may be diffused and
advancing knowledge in all other forms walk through the land with giant
strides but while the newspaper press of america is in or near its
present abject state high moral improvement in that country is hopeless
year by year it must and will go back year by year the tone of public
feeling must sink lower down year by year the congress and the senate
must become of less account before all decent men and year by year the
memory of the great fathers of the revolution must be outraged more and
more in the bad life of their degenerate child

among the herd of journals which are published in the states there are
some the reader scarcely need be told of character and credit  from
personal intercourse with accomplished gentlemen connected with
publications of this class i have derived both pleasure and profit  but
the name of these is few and of the others legion and the influence of
the good is powerless to counteract the moral poison of the bad

among the gentry of america among the well-informed and moderate in the
learned professions at the bar and on the bench there is as there can
be but one opinion in reference to the vicious character of these
infamous journals  it is sometimes contended—i will not say strangely
for it is natural to seek excuses for such a disgrace—that their
influence is not so great as a visitor would suppose  i must be pardoned
for saying that there is no warrant for this plea and that every fact
and circumstance tends directly to the opposite conclusion

when any man of any grade of desert in intellect or character can climb
to any public distinction no matter what in america without first
grovelling down upon the earth and bending the knee before this monster
of depravity when any private excellence is safe from its attacks when
any social confidence is left unbroken by it or any tie of social
decency and honour is held in the least regard when any man in that free
country has freedom of opinion and presumes to think for himself and
speak for himself without humble reference to a censorship which for
its rampant ignorance and base dishonesty he utterly loathes and
despises in his heart when those who most acutely feel its infamy and
the reproach it casts upon the nation and who most denounce it to each
other dare to set their heels upon and crush it openly in the sight of
all men then i will believe that its influence is lessening and men
are returning to their manly senses  but while that press has its evil
eye in every house and its black hand in every appointment in the state
from a president to a postman while with ribald slander for its only
stock in trade it is the standard literature of an enormous class who
must find their reading in a newspaper or they will not read at all so
long must its odium be upon the countrys head and so long must the evil
it works be plainly visible in the republic

to those who are accustomed to the leading english journals or to the
respectable journals of the continent of europe to those who are
accustomed to anything else in print and paper it would be impossible
without an amount of extract for which i have neither space nor
inclination to convey an adequate idea of this frightful engine in
america  but if any man desire confirmation of my statement on this
head let him repair to any place in this city of london where scattered
numbers of these publications are to be found and there let him form
his own opinion {206}

it would be well there can be no doubt for the american people as a
whole if they loved the real less and the ideal somewhat more  it
would be well if there were greater encouragement to lightness of heart
and gaiety and a wider cultivation of what is beautiful without being
eminently and directly useful  but here i think the general
remonstrance  we are a new country which is so often advanced as an
excuse for defects which are quite unjustifiable as being of right
only the slow growth of an old one may be very reasonably urged and i
yet hope to hear of there being some other national amusement in the
united states besides newspaper politics

they certainly are not a humorous people and their temperament always
impressed me is being of a dull and gloomy character  in shrewdness of
remark and a certain cast-iron quaintness the yankees or people of new
england unquestionably take the lead as they do in most other evidences
of intelligence  but in travelling about out of the large cities—as i
have remarked in former parts of these volumes—i was quite oppressed by
the prevailing seriousness and melancholy air of business which was so
general and unvarying that at every new town i came to i seemed to meet
the very same people whom i had left behind me at the last  such
defects as are perceptible in the national manners seem to me to be
referable in a great degree to this cause which has generated a dull
sullen persistence in coarse usages and rejected the graces of life as
undeserving of attention  there is no doubt that washington who was
always most scrupulous and exact on points of ceremony perceived the
tendency towards this mistake even in his time and did his utmost to
correct it

i cannot hold with other writers on these subjects that the prevalence of
various forms of dissent in america is in any way attributable to the
non-existence there of an established church indeed i think the temper
of the people if it admitted of such an institution being founded
amongst them would lead them to desert it as a matter of course merely
because it was established  but supposing it to exist i doubt its
probable efficacy in summoning the wandering sheep to one great fold
simply because of the immense amount of dissent which prevails at home
and because i do not find in america any one form of religion with which
we in europe or even in england are unacquainted  dissenters resort
thither in great numbers as other people do simply because it is a land
of resort and great settlements of them are founded because ground can
be purchased and towns and villages reared where there were none of the
human creation before  but even the shakers emigrated from england our
country is not unknown to mr joseph smith the apostle of mormonism or
to his benighted disciples i have beheld religious scenes myself in some
of our populous towns which can hardly be surpassed by an american
camp-meeting and i am not aware that any instance of superstitious
imposture on the one hand and superstitious credulity on the other has
had its origin in the united states which we cannot more than parallel
by the precedents of mrs southcote mary tofts the rabbit-breeder or
even mr thorn of canterbury which latter case arose some time after
the dark ages had passed away

the republican institutions of america undoubtedly lead the people to
assert their self-respect and their equality but a traveller is bound to
bear those institutions in his mind and not hastily to resent the near
approach of a class of strangers who at home would keep aloof  this
characteristic when it was tinctured with no foolish pride and stopped
short of no honest service never offended me and i very seldom if
ever experienced its rude or unbecoming display  once or twice it was
comically developed as in the following case but this was an amusing
incident and not the rule or near it

i wanted a pair of boots at a certain town for i had none to travel in
but those with the memorable cork soles which were much too hot for the
fiery decks of a steamboat  i therefore sent a message to an artist in
boots importing with my compliments that i should be happy to see him
if he would do me the polite favour to call  he very kindly returned for
answer that he would  look round at six oclock that evening

i was lying on the sofa with a book and a wine-glass at about that
time when the door opened and a gentleman in a stiff cravat within a
year or two on either side of thirty entered in his hat and gloves
walked up to the looking-glass arranged his hair took off his gloves
slowly produced a measure from the uttermost depths of his coat-pocket
and requested me in a languid tone to  unfix my straps  i complied
but looked with some curiosity at his hat which was still upon his head
it might have been that or it might have been the heat—but he took it
off  then he sat himself down on a chair opposite to me rested an arm
on each knee and leaning forward very much took from the ground by a
great effort the specimen of metropolitan workmanship which i had just
pulled off whistling pleasantly as he did so  he turned it over and
over surveyed it with a contempt no language can express and inquired
if i wished him to fix me a boot like that?  i courteously replied
that provided the boots were large enough i would leave the rest to him
that if convenient and practicable i should not object to their bearing
some resemblance to the model then before him but that i would be
entirely guided by and would beg to leave the whole subject to his
judgment and discretion  you ant partickler about this scoop in the
heel i suppose then? says he  we dont foller that here  i repeated
my last observation  he looked at himself in the glass again went
closer to it to dash a grain or two of dust out of the corner of his eye
and settled his cravat  all this time my leg and foot were in the air
 nearly ready sir? i inquired   well pretty nigh he said  keep
steady  i kept as steady as i could both in foot and face and having
by this time got the dust out and found his pencil-case he measured me
and made the necessary notes  when he had finished he fell into his old
attitude and taking up the boot again mused for some time   and this
he said at last  is an english boot is it?  this is a london boot
eh?   that sir i replied  is a london boot  he mused over it
again after the manner of hamlet with yoricks skull nodded his head
as who should say  i pity the institutions that led to the production of
this boot rose put up his pencil notes and paper—glancing at
himself in the glass all the time—put on his hat—drew on his gloves very
slowly and finally walked out  when he had been gone about a minute
the door reopened and his hat and his head reappeared  he looked round
the room and at the boot again which was still lying on the floor
appeared thoughtful for a minute and then said  well good arternoon
 good afternoon sir said i and that was the end of the interview

there is but one other head on which i wish to offer a remark and that
has reference to the public health  in so vast a country where there
are thousands of millions of acres of land yet unsettled and uncleared
and on every rood of which vegetable decomposition is annually taking
place where there are so many great rivers and such opposite varieties
of climate there cannot fail to be a great amount of sickness at certain
seasons  but i may venture to say after conversing with many members of
the medical profession in america that i am not singular in the opinion
that much of the disease which does prevail might be avoided if a few
common precautions were observed  greater means of personal cleanliness
are indispensable to this end the custom of hastily swallowing large
quantities of animal food three times a-day and rushing back to
sedentary pursuits after each meal must be changed the gentler sex must
go more wisely clad and take more healthful exercise and in the latter
clause the males must be included also  above all in public
institutions and throughout the whole of every town and city the system
of ventilation and drainage and removal of impurities requires to be
thoroughly revised  there is no local legislature in america which may
not study mr chadwicks excellent report upon the sanitary condition of
our labouring classes with immense advantage

                                * * * * *

i have now arrived at the close of this book  i have little reason to
believe from certain warnings i have had since i returned to england
that it will be tenderly or favourably received by the american people
and as i have written the truth in relation to the mass of those who form
their judgments and express their opinions it will be seen that i have
no desire to court by any adventitious means the popular applause

it is enough for me to know that what i have set down in these pages
cannot cost me a single friend on the other side of the atlantic who is
in anything deserving of the name  for the rest i put my trust
implicitly in the spirit in which they have been conceived and penned
and i can bide my time

i have made no reference to my reception nor have i suffered it to
influence me in what i have written for in either case i should have
offered but a sorry acknowledgment compared with that i bear within my
breast towards those partial readers of my former books across the
water who met me with an open hand and not with one that closed upon an
iron muzzle

postscript


at a public dinner given to me on saturday the 18th of april 1868 in
the city of new york by two hundred representatives of the press of the
united states of america i made the following observations among others

 so much of my voice has lately been heard in the land that i might have
been contented with troubling you no further from my present
standing-point were it not a duty with which i henceforth charge myself
not only here but on every suitable occasion whatsoever and wheresoever
to express my high and grateful sense of my second reception in america
and to bear my honest testimony to the national generosity and
magnanimity  also to declare how astounded i have been by the amazing
changes i have seen around me on every side—changes moral changes
physical changes in the amount of land subdued and peopled changes in
the rise of vast new cities changes in the growth of older cities almost
out of recognition changes in the graces and amenities of life changes
in the press without whose advancement no advancement can take place
anywhere  nor am i believe me so arrogant as to suppose that in five
and twenty years there have been no changes in me and that i had nothing
to learn and no extreme impressions to correct when i was here first
and this brings me to a point on which i have ever since i landed in the
united states last november observed a strict silence though sometimes
tempted to break it but in reference to which i will with your good
leave take you into my confidence now  even the press being human may
be sometimes mistaken or misinformed and i rather think that i have in
one or two rare instances observed its information to be not strictly
accurate with reference to myself  indeed i have now and again been
more surprised by printed news that i have read of myself than by any
printed news that i have ever read in my present state of existence
thus the vigour and perseverance with which i have for some months past
been collecting materials for and hammering away at a new book on
america has much astonished me seeing that all that time my declaration
has been perfectly well known to my publishers on both sides of the
atlantic that no consideration on earth would induce me to write one
but what i have intended what i have resolved upon (and this is the
confidence i seek to place in you) is on my return to england in my own
person in my own journal to bear for the behoof of my countrymen such
testimony to the gigantic changes in this country as i have hinted at
to-night  also to record that wherever i have been in the smallest
places equally with the largest i have been received with unsurpassable
politeness delicacy sweet temper hospitality consideration and with
unsurpassable respect for the privacy daily enforced upon me by the
nature of my avocation here and the state of my health  this testimony
so long as i live and so long as my descendants have any legal right in
my books i shall cause to be republished as an appendix to every copy
of those two books of mine in which i have referred to america  and this
i will do and cause to be done not in mere love and thankfulness but
because i regard it as an act of plain justice and honour

i said these words with the greatest earnestness that i could lay upon
them and i repeat them in print here with equal earnestness  so long as
this book shall last i hope that they will form a part of it and will
be fairly read as inseparable from my experiences and impressions of
america﻿[illustration part i]




chapter i
the dawn of a century of discovery

slackness of discovery during the struggles of the republic and
empire seetzen's voyages in syria and palestine hauran and the
circumnavigation of the dead sea decapolis journey in arabia 
burckhardt in syria expeditions in nubia upon the two branches of the
nile pilgrimage to mecca and medina the english in india webb at the
source of the ganges narrative of a journey in the punjab christie
and pottinger in scinde the same explorers cross beluchistan into
persia elphinstone in afghanistan persia according to gardane a
dupré morier macdonald-kinneir price and ouseley guldenstædt and
klaproth in the caucasus lewis and clarke in the rocky mountains 
raffles in sumatra and java


a sensible diminution in geographical discovery marks the close of the
eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries

we have already noticed the organization of the expedition sent in
search of la pérouse by the french republic and also captain baudin's
important cruise along the australian coasts these are the only
instances in which the unrestrained passions and fratricidal struggles
of the french nation allowed the government to exhibit interest in
geography a science which is especially favoured by the french

at a later period bonaparte consulted several savants and
distinguished artists and the materials for that grand undertaking
which first gave an idea (incomplete though it was) of the ancient
civilization of the land of the pharaohs were collected together but
when bonaparte had completely given place to napoleon the egotistical
monarch sacrificing all else to his ruling passion for war would no
longer listen to explorations voyages or possible discoveries they
represented money and men stolen from him and his expenditure of those
materials was far too great to allow of such futile waste this was
clearly shown when he ceded the last remnants of french colonial rule
in america to the united states for a few millions

happily other nations were not oppressed by the same iron hand
absorbed although they might be in their struggle with france they
could still find volunteers to extend the range of geographical
science to establish archæology upon scientific bases and to
prosecute linguistic and ethnographical enterprise

the learned geographer malte-brun in an article published by him in
the "nouvelles annales des voyages" in 1817 gives a minute account of
the condition of french geographical knowledge at the beginning of the
nineteenth century and of the many desiderata of that science he
reviews the progress already made in navigation astronomy and
languages the india company far from concealing its discoveries as
jealousy had induced the hudson bay company to do founded academies
published memoirs and encouraged travellers

war itself was utilized for the french army gathered a store of
precious material in egypt we shall shortly see how emulation spread
among the various nations

from the commencement of the century one country has taken the lead in
great discoveries german explorers have worked so earnestly and have
proved themselves possessed of will so strong and instinct so sure
that they have left little for their successors to do beyond verifying
and completing their discoveries

the first in order of time was ulric jasper seetzen born in 1767 in
east friesland he completed his education at göttingen and published
some essays upon statistics and the natural sciences for which he had
a natural inclination these publications attracted the attention of
the government and he was appointed aulic councillor in the province
of tever

seetzen's ambition like that of burckhardt subsequently was an
expedition to central africa but he wished previously to make an
exploration of palestine and syria to which countries attention was
shortly to be directed by the "palestine association" founded in
london in 1805

seetzen did not wait for this period but in 1802 set out for
constantinople furnished with suitable introductions

although many pilgrims and travellers had successively visited the holy
land and syria the vaguest notions about these countries prevailed
their physical geography was not determined details were wanting and
certain regions as for example the lebanon and the dead sea had never
been explored

comparative geography did not exist it has taken the unwearied efforts
of the english association and the science of travellers in connexion
with it to erect that study into a science seetzen whose studies had
been various found himself admirably prepared to explore a country
which often visited was still in reality new

having travelled through anatolia seetzen reached aleppo in may 1802
he remained there a year devoting himself to the practical study of
the arabic tongue making extracts from eastern historians and
geographers verifying the astronomical position of aleppo prosecuting
his investigations into natural history collecting manuscripts and
translating many of those popular songs and legends which are such
valuable aids to the knowledge of a nation

seetzen left aleppo in 1805 for damascus his first expedition led him
across the provinces of hauran and jaulan situated to the se of that
town no traveller had as yet visited these two provinces which in the
days of roman dominion had played an important part in the history of
the jews under the names of auranitis and gaulonitis seetzen was the
first to give an idea of their geography

the enterprising traveller explored the lebanon and baalbek he
prosecuted his discoveries south of damascus and entered judea
exploring the eastern portion of hermon the jordan and the dead sea
this was the dwelling-place of those races well known to us in jewish
history the ammonites moabites and gileadites at the time of the
roman conquest the western portion of this country was known as perea
and was the centre of the celebrated decapolis or confederacy of ten
cities no modern traveller had visited these regions a fact
sufficient to induce seetzen to begin his exploration with them

his friends at damascus had tried to dissuade him from the journey by
picturing the difficulties and danger of a route frequented by
bedouins but nothing could stay him before visiting the decapolis
region and investigating the condition of its ruins seetzen traversed
a small district named ladscha which bore a bad reputation at
damascus on account of the bedouins who occupied it but which was said
to contain remarkable antiquities

leaving damascus on the 12th of december 1805 with an armenian guide
who misled him from the first seetzen having prudently provided
himself with a passport from the pasha proceeded from village to
village escorted by an armed attendant

in a narrative published in the earlier "annales des voyages" says the
traveller 

"that portion of ladscha which i have seen is like hauran entirely
formed of basalt often very porous and in many districts forming vast
stony deserts the villages which are mostly in ruins are built on
the sides of the rocks the black colour of the basalt the ruined
houses the churches and towers fallen into decay with the total
dearth of trees and verdure combine to give a sombre aspect to this
country which strikes one almost with dread in almost every village
are either grecian inscriptions columns or other remnants of
antiquity amongst others i copied an inscription of the emperor marcus
aurelius here as in hauran the doors were of basalt"

seetzen had scarcely arrived at the village of gerasa and enjoyed a
brief rest before he was surrounded by half a score of mounted men
who said they had come by order of the vice-governor of hauran to
arrest him their master omar aga having learned that the traveller
had been seen in the country the preceding year and imagining his
passports to be forgeries had sent them to bring him before him

resistance was useless without allowing himself to be disconcerted by
an incident which he regarded as a simple contretemps seetzen
proceeded in the direction of hauran where after a day and a half's
journey he met omar aga travelling with the mecca caravan the
travellers having received a hearty welcome departed on the morrow
but meeting upon his way with many troops of arabs upon whom his
demeanour imposed respect he came to the conclusion that it had been
omar aga's intention to have him robbed

returning to damascus seetzen had great trouble in finding a guide who
would accompany him in his expedition along the eastern shore of the
jordan and around the dead sea at last a certain yusuf-al-milky a
member of the greek church who for some thirty years had carried on
traffic with the arab tribes and travelled in the provinces which
seetzen desired to visit agreed to bear him company

the two travellers left damascus on the 19th of january 1806
seetzen's entire baggage consisted of a few clothes some indispensable
books paper for drying plants and an assortment of drugs necessary
to sustain his assumed character as a physician he wore the dress of a
sheik of secondary rank

the districts of rasheiya and hasbeiya at the foot of mount
hermon whose summit at the time was hidden by snow were the first
explored by seetzen for the reason that they were the least known in
syria

he then visited achha a village inhabited by the druses upon the
opposite side of the mountain rasheiya the residence of the emir and
hasbeiya where he paid a visit to the greek bishop of szur or szeida
to whom he carried letters of recommendation the object which chiefly
attracted his attention in this mountainous district was an
asphalt-mine whose produce is there used to protect the vines from
insects

leaving hasbeiya seetzen proceeded to bâniâs the ancient casaræa
philippi which is now a mere collection of huts even if traces of its
fortifications were discoverable not the smallest remains could be
found of the splendid temple erected by herod in honour of augustus

ancient authorities hold that the river of bâniâs is the source of the
jordan but in reality that title belongs to the river hasbany which
forms the larger branch of the jordan seetzen recognized it as he
also did the lake of merom or the ancient samachonitis

here he was deserted by his muleteers whom nothing could induce to
accompany him so far as the bridge of jisr-benat-yakûb and also by his
guide yusuf whom he was forced to send by the open road to await his
arrival at tiberias while he himself proceeded on foot towards the
celebrated bridge accompanied by a single arab attendant

he however found no one at jisr-benat-yakûb who was willing to
accompany him along the eastern shore of the jordan until a native
believing him to be a doctor begged him to go and see his sheik who
was suffering from ophthalmia and who lived upon the eastern bank of
the lake of tiberias

seetzen gladly availed himself of this opportunity and it was well he
did so for he was thus enabled to study the lake of tiberias and also
the wady zemmâk at his leisure not however without risk of being
robbed and murdered by his guide finally he reached tiberias called
by the arabs tabaria where he found yusuf who had been waiting for
him for several days

"the town of tiberias" says seetzen "is situated upon the lake of the
same name upon the land side it is surrounded by a good wall of cut
basalt rock but nevertheless it scarcely deserves to be called a
town no trace of its earlier splendour remains but the ruins of the
more ancient city which extended to the thermæ a league to the
eastward are recognizable

"the famous djezar-pasha caused a bath to be erected above the
principal spring if these baths were in europe they would rival all
those now existing the valley in which the lake is situated is so
sheltered and so warm that dates lemon-trees oranges and indigo
flourish there whilst on the high ground surrounding it the products
of more temperate climates might be grown"

south-west of the lake are the remains of the ancient city of tarichæa
there between two mountain chains lies the beautiful plain of el
ghor poorly cultivated and overrun by arab hordes no incident of
moment marked seetzen's journey to decapolis during which he was
obliged to dress as a mendicant to escape the rapacity of the native
tribes

"over my shirt" he relates "i wore an old kambas or dressing-gown
and above that a woman's ragged chemise my head was covered with rags
and my feet with old sandals i was protected from cold and wet by an
old ragged 'abbaje' which i wore across my shoulders and a stick cut
from a tree served me as a staff my guide who was a greek christian
was dressed much in the same style and together we scoured the country
for some ten days often hindered in our journey by chilling rains
which wetted us to the skin for my part i travelled an entire day in
the mud with bare feet because i could not wear my sandals upon sodden
ground"

draa which he reached a little farther on presented but a mass of
desert ruins and no trace of the monuments which rendered it famous in
earlier days were visible el-botthin the next district contains
hundreds of caverns hewn in the rocks which were occupied by the
ancient inhabitants it was much the same at seetzen's visit that mkês
was formerly a rich and important city is proved by its many ruined
tombs and monuments seetzen identified it with gadara one of the
minor towns of the decapolis some leagues beyond are the ruins of abil
or abila seetzen's guide aoser refused to go there being afraid of
the arabs the traveller was therefore obliged to go alone

"this town" he says "is entirely in ruins and abandoned not a single
building remains but its ancient splendour is sufficiently proved by
ruins traces of the old fortifications remain and also many pillars
and arches of marble basalt and granite beyond the walls i found a
great number of pillars two of them were of an extraordinary size
hence i concluded that a large temple had formerly existed there"

on leaving el-botthin seetzen entered the district of edschlun and
speedily discovered the important ruins of dscherrasch which may be
compared with those of palmyra and baalbek

"it is difficult to conjecture" says seetzen "how this town which
was formerly so celebrated has hitherto escaped the attention of
antiquarians it is situated in an open plain which is fertile and
watered by a river several tombs with fine bas-reliefs arrested my
attention before i entered it upon one of them i remarked a greek
inscription the walls which were of cut marble are entirely crumbled
away but their length over three quarters of a league is still
discernible no private house has been preserved but i remarked
several public buildings of fine architectural design i found two
magnificent amphitheatres constructed of solid marble the columns
niches &c in good condition a few palaces and three temples one
of the latter having a peristyle of twelve large corinthian pillars of
which eleven were still erect in one of these temples i found a fallen
column of the finest polished egyptian granite beside these i found
one of the city gates formed of three arches and ornamented with
pilasters in good preservation the finest of the remains is a street
adorned throughout its length with corinthian columns on either side
and terminating in a semicircle which was surrounded by sixty ionic
columns all of the choicest marble this street was crossed by
another and at the junction of the two large pedestals of wrought
stone occupied each angle probably in former times these bore statues
much of the pavement was constructed of hewn stone altogether i
counted nearly two hundred columns still in a fair state of
preservation but the number of these is far exceeded by those which
have fallen into decay for i saw only half the extent of the town and
in all probability the other half beyond this was also rich in
remarkable relics"

from seetzen's description dscherrasch would appear to be identical
with the ancient gerasa a town which up to that time had been
erroneously placed on the maps

the traveller crossed gerka the jabok of jewish history which forms
the northern boundary of the country of the ammonites and penetrated
into the district of el-belka formerly a flourishing country but
which he found uncultivated and barren with but one small town szalt
formerly known as amathus afterwards seetzen visited amman a town
which under the name of philadelphia is renowned among the
decapolitan cities and where many antiquities are to be found eleal
an ancient city of the amorites madaba called madba in the time of
moses mount nebo diban karrak the country of the moabites and the
ruins of robba (rabbath) anciently the royal residence after much
fatigue he reached the region situated at the southern extremity of
the dead sea named gor-es-sophia

the heat was extreme and great salt-plains where no watercourses
exist had to be crossed upon the 6th of april seetzen arrived in
bethlehem and soon afterwards at jerusalem having suffered greatly
from thirst but having passed through most interesting countries
hitherto unvisited by any modern traveller

[illustration jerusalem]

[illustration map of egypt nubia and part of arabia]

he had also collected much valuable information respecting the nature
of the waters of the dead sea refuted many false notions corrected
mistakes upon the most carefully constructed maps identified several
sites of the ancient peræa and established the existence of numberless
ruins which bore witness to the prosperity of all this region under
the sway of the roman empire upon the 25th of june 1806 seetzen left
jerusalem and returned to st jean d'acre by sea

in an article in the revùe germanique for 1858 m vinen speaks of
his expedition as a veritable journey of discovery seetzen however
was unwilling to leave his discoveries incomplete ten months later he
again visited the dead sea and added largely to his observations from
thence he proceeded to cairo where he remained for two years and
bought a large portion of the oriental manuscripts which now enrich the
library of gotha he collected many facts about the interior of the
country choosing instinctively those only which could be amply
substantiated

seetzen with his insatiable thirst for discovery could not remain
long in repose far removed from idleness though it was in april
1809 he finally left the capital of egypt and directed his course
towards suez and the peninsula of sinai which he resolved to explore
before proceeding to arabia at this time arabia was a little-known
country frequented only by merchants trading in mocha coffee-beans
before niebuhr's time no scientific expedition for the study of the
geography of the country or the manners and customs of the inhabitants
had been organized

this expedition owed its formation to professor michälis who was
anxious to obtain information which would throw light on certain
passages in the bible and its expenses were defrayed by the generosity
of king frederick v of denmark it comprised von hannen the
mathematician forskaal the naturalist a physician named cramer
braurenfeind the painter and niebuhr the engineer a company of
learned and scientific men who thoroughly fulfilled all expectations
founded upon their reputations

in the course of two years from 1762 to 1764 they visited egypt
mount sinai jeddah landed at loheia and advancing into arabia felix
explored the country in accordance with the speciality of each man but
the enterprising travellers succumbed to illness and fatigue and
niebuhr alone survived to utilize the observations made by himself and
his companions his work on the subject is an inexhaustible treasury
which may be drawn upon in our own day with advantage

seetzen therefore had much to achieve to eclipse the fame of his
predecessor he omitted no means of doing so after publicly professing
the faith of islam he embarked at suez for mecca and hoped to enter
that city disguised as a pilgrim tor and jeddah were the places
visited by him before he travelled to the holy city of mecca he was
much impressed by the wealth of the faithful and the peculiar
characteristics of that city which lives for and by the mahometan
cultus "i was seized" says the traveller "with an emotion which i
have never experienced elsewhere"

it is alike unnecessary to dwell upon this portion of the voyage and
upon that relating to the excursion to medina burckhardt's narrative
gives a precise and trustworthy account of those holy places and
besides there remain of seetzen's works only the extracts published in
"les annales des voyages" and in the correspondence of the baron de
zach the journal of seetzen's travels was published in german and in
a very incomplete manner only in 1858

the traveller returned from medina to mecca and devoted himself to a
secret study of the town with its religious ceremonies and to taking
astronomical observations which determined the position of the capital
of islam

seetzen returned to jeddah on the 23rd march 1810 he then
re-embarked with the arab who had been his guide to mecca for
hodeidah which is one of the principal ports of yemen passing the
mountainous district of beith-el-fakih where coffee is cultivated
after a month's delay at doran on account of illness seetzen entered
sana the capital of yemen which he calls the most beautiful city of
the east on the 2nd of june upon the 22nd of july he reached aden
and in november he was at mecca whence the last letters received from
him are dated upon re-entering yemen he like niebuhr was robbed of
his collections and baggage upon the pretext that he collected
animals in order to compose a philtre with the intention of poisoning
the springs

seetzen however would not quietly submit to be robbed he started at
once for sana intending to lay a complaint before the iman this was
in december 1811 a few days later news of his sudden death arrived at
taes and the tidings soon reached the ears of the europeans who
frequented the arabian ports

it is little to the purpose now to inquire upon whom the responsibility
of this death rests whether upon the iman or upon those who had
plundered the traveller but we may well regret that so thorough an
explorer already familiar with the habits and customs of the arabs
was unable to continue his explorations and that the greater portion
of his diaries and observations have been entirely lost

"seetzen" says m vivien de saint martin "was the first traveller
since ludovico barthema (1503) who visited mecca and before his time
no european had even seen the holy city of medina consecrated by the
tomb of the prophet"

from these remarks we gather how invaluable the trustworthy narrative
of this disinterested and well-informed traveller would have been

just as an untimely death ended seetzen's self-imposed mission
burckhardt set out upon a similar enterprise and like him commenced
his long and minute exploration of arabia by preliminary travel through
syria

"it is seldom in the history of science" says m vivien de saint
martin "that we see two men of such merit succeed each other in the
same career or rather continue it for in reality burckhardt followed
up the traces seetzen had opened out and seconded for a considerable
time by favourable circumstances which enabled him to prosecute his
explorations he was enabled to add very considerably to the known
discoveries of his predecessor"

although john lewis burckhardt was not english for he was a native of
lausanne he must none the less be classed among the travellers of
great britain it was owing to his relations with sir joseph banks the
naturalist who had accompanied cook and hamilton the secretary of the
african association who gave him ready and valuable support that
burckhardt was enabled to accomplish what he did

burckhardt was a deeply learned man he had passed through the
universities of leipzic and göttingen where he attended blumenbach's
lectures and afterwards through cambridge where he studied arabic he
started for the east in 1809 to inure himself to the hardships of a
traveller's life he imposed long fasts upon himself accustomed
himself to endure thirst and chose the pavements of london or dusty
roads for a resting-place but how trifling were these experiences in
comparison with those involved in an apostolate of science

leaving london for syria where he hoped to perfect his knowledge of
arabic burckhardt intended to proceed to cairo and to reach fezzan by
the route formerly opened up by hornemann once arrived in that
country circumstances must determine his future course

burckhardt having taken the name of ibrahim-ibn-abdallah intended to
pass as an indian mussulman in order to carry out this disguise he
had recourse to many expedients in an obituary notice of him in the
"annales des voyages" it is related that when unexpectedly called upon
to speak the indian language he immediately had recourse to german an
italian dragoman suspecting him of being a giaour pulled him by his
beard thereby offering him the greatest insult possible in his
character of mussulman but burckhardt had so thoroughly entered into
the spirit of his rôle that he responded by a vigorous blow which
sending the unfortunate dragoman spinning to a distance turned the
laugh against him and thoroughly convinced the bystanders of the
sincerity of the traveller

[illustration portrait of burckhardt (fac-simile of early
engraving)]

burckhardt remained at aleppo from september 1809 to february 1812
pursuing his studies of syrian manners and customs and of the language
of the country with but one interruption a six months' excursion to
damascus palmyra and the hauran a country which had hitherto been
visited by seetzen only

it is related that during an excursion into gor a district north of
aleppo upon the shores of the euphrates the traveller was robbed of
his baggage and stripped of his clothes by a band of robbers when
nothing remained to him but his trousers the wife of a chief who had
not received her share of the spoil wished to relieve him even of
those indispensable garments

the revue germanique says "we owe a great deal of information to
these excursions respecting a country of which we had only crude
notions gained from seetzen's incomplete communications burckhardt's
power of close observation detected a number of interesting facts even
in well-known districts which had escaped the notice of other
travellers these materials were published by colonel martin william
leake himself a geographer a man of learning and a distinguished
traveller"

burckhardt had seen palmyra and baalbek the slopes of lebanon and the
valley of the orontes lake huleh and the sources of the jordan he
had discovered many ancient sites and his observations had led
especially to the discovery of the site of the far-famed apamoea
although both he and his publisher were mistaken in their application
of the data obtained his excursions in the auranitis were equally
rich even though coming after seetzen's in those geographical and
archæological details which represent the actual condition of a
country and throw a light upon the comparative geography of every age

leaving damascus in 1813 burckhardt visited the dead sea the valley
of akâba and the ancient port of azcongater districts which in our
own day are traversed by parties of english with their murray
cook or bædeker in their hands but which then were only to be
visited at the risk of life in a lateral valley the traveller came
upon the ruins of petra the ancient capital of arabia petræa

at the end of the year burckhardt was at cairo judging it best not to
join the caravan which was just starting for fezzan he felt a great
inclination to visit nubia a country rich in attractions for the
historian geographer and archæologist nubia the cradle of egyptian
civilization had only been visited since the days of the portuguese
alvares by poncet and lenoir duroule both frenchmen at the close of
the seventeenth century at the opening of the eighteenth by bruce
whose narrative had so often been doubted and by norden who had not
penetrated beyond derr

in 1813 burckhardt explored nubia proper including mahass and
kemijour this expedition cost him only forty-two francs a very paltry
sum in comparison with the price involved in the smallest attempt at an
african journey in our own day but we must not forget that burckhardt
was content to live upon millet-seed and that his entire cortége
consisted of two dromedaries

two englishmen mr legh and mr smelt were travelling in the country
at the same time scattering gold and presents as they passed and thus
rendering the visits of their successors costly

burckhardt crossed the cataracts of the nile "a little farther on"
says the narrative "near a place called djebel-lamoule the arab
guides practise a curious extortion" this is their plan of proceeding
they halt descend from their camels and arrange a little heap of sand
and pebbles in imitation of a nubian tomb this they call "preparing
the grave for the traveller" and follow up the demonstration by an
imperious demand for money burckhardt having watched his guide
commence this operation began quietly to imitate him and then said
"here is thy grave as we are brothers it is but fair that we should
be buried together" the arab could not help laughing both graves were
simultaneously destroyed and remounting the camels the cavalcade
proceeded better friends than before the arab quoted a saying from
the koran "no human being knows in what spot of the earth he will find
his grave"

[illustration "here is thy grave"]

burckhardt had hoped to get as far as dingola but was obliged to rest
satisfied with collecting information about the country and the
mamelukes who had taken refuge there after the massacre of their army
by order of the viceroy of egypt

the attention of the traveller was frequently directed to the ruins of
temples and ancient cities than which none are more curious than those
of isambul

"the temple on the banks of the nile is approached by an avenue flanked
by six colossal figures which measure six feet and a half from the
ground to the knees they are representations of isis and osiris in
various attitudes the sides and capitals of the pillars are covered
with paintings or hieroglyphic carvings in which burckhardt thought a
very ancient style was to be traced all these are hewn out of the
rock and the faces appear to have been painted yellow with black
hair two hundred yards from this temple are the ruins of a still
larger monument consisting of four enormous figures so deeply buried
in the sand that it is impossible to say whether they are in a standing
or sitting posture"

these descriptions of antiquities which in our own day are accurately
known by drawings and photographs have however little value for us
and are merely interesting as indicating the state of the ruins when
burckhardt visited them and enabling us to judge how far the
depredations of the arabs have since changed them

burckhardt's first excursion was limited to the borders of the nile a
narrow space made up of little valleys which debouched into the river
the traveller estimated the population of the country at 100000
distributed over a surface of fertile land 450 miles in length by a
quarter of a mile in width

"the men" says the narrative "are as a rule muscular rather
shorter than the egyptians having little beard or moustache usually
merely a pointed beard under the chin they have a pleasant expression
are superior to the egyptians in courage and intelligence and
naturally inquisitive they are not thieves they occasionally pick up
a fortune by dint of hard work but they have little enterprise women
share the same physical advantages are pretty as a rule and well
made their appearance is gentle and pleasing and they are modest in
behaviour m denon has underrated the nubians but it must not be
forgotten that their physique varies in different districts where
there is much land to cultivate they are well developed but in
districts where arable land is a mere strip the people diminish in
vigour and are sometimes walking skeletons"

the whole country groaned under the yoke of the kashefs who were
descendants of the commander of the bosniacs and paid only a small
annual tribute to egypt which however was sufficient to serve as a
pretext for oppressing the unfortunate fellaheen burckhardt cites a
curious example of the insolence with which the kashefs behaved

"hassan kashef" he says was in need of barley for his horses
accompanied by his slaves he walked into the fields and there met the
owner of a fine plot of barley "how badly you cultivate your land"
said he "here you plant barley in a field where you might have reaped
an excellent crop of water-melons of double the value see here are
some melon-seeds (offering a handful to the peasant proprietor) sow
your field with these and you slaves tear up this bad barley and
bring it to me"

in march 1814 after a short rest burckhardt undertook a fresh
exploration not this time of the banks of the nile but of the nubian
desert justly conceiving poverty to be his surest safe guard he
dismissed his servant sold his camel and contenting himself with one
ass joined a caravan of poor traders the caravan started from daraou
a village inhabited partly by fellahs and partly by ababdéh arabs the
traveller had good reason to complain of the former not because they
recognized him as a european but because they imagined him to be a
syrian turk come to share the commerce in slaves of which they had the
monopoly

it would be useless to enumerate the names of the bridges hills and
valleys in this desert we will rather summarize the traveller's report
of the physical aspect of the country

bruce who had explored it paints it in too gloomy colours and
exaggerates the difficulties of the route if burckhardt is to be
credited the country is less barren than that between aleppo and
bagdad or damascus and medina the nubian desert is not merely a plain
of sand where nothing interrupts the dreary monotony it is
interspersed with rocks some not less than 300 feet in height and
shaded by thickets of acacias or date-trees the shelter of these trees
is however unavailing against the vertical rays of the sun which
explains an arabic proverb "rely upon the favour of the great and the
shade of an acacia"

at ankheyre or wady-berber the caravan reached the nile after
passing shigre one of the best mountain springs one danger only is to
be feared in crossing the desert that of finding the wells at nedjeym
dry and unless the traveller should lose his way which however
with trustworthy guides is little likely to happen no serious
obstacle arises

it would appear therefore that the sufferings experienced by bruce
must have been greatly exaggerated although the narrative of the
scotch traveller is generally trustworthy the natives of the province
of berber appear to be identical with the barbarins of bruce the
barabas mentioned by d'anville and the barauras spoken of by poncet
they are a well-made race and different in feature from the negroes
they maintain their purity of descent by marrying only with the women
of their own or of kindred tribes curious as is the picture burckhardt
draws of the character and manners of this tribe it is not at all
edifying it would be difficult to convey an idea of the corruption and
degradation of the berbers the little town of wady-berber a
commercial centre the rendezvous for caravans and a depôt for slaves
is a regular resort of banditti

burckhardt who had trusted to the protection of the merchants of
daraou found that he had made a great mistake in so doing they sought
every means of plundering him chased him out of their company and
forced him to seek refuge with the guides and donkey-drivers who
cordially welcomed him

upon the 10th of april a fine was levied upon the caravan by the mek of
damer which lies a little south of the tributary mogren (called mareb
by bruce) this is a well-kept and cleanly fakir village which
contrasts agreeably with the ruins and filth of berber the fakirs give
themselves up to the practices of sorcery magic and charlatanism one
of them it is said could even make a lamb bleat in the stomach of the
man who had stolen and eaten it these ignorant people have entire
faith in such fables and it must be reluctantly admitted that the fact
contributes not a little to the peace of the town and the prosperity of
the country

from damer burckhardt proceeded to shendy where he passed a month
during which time no one suspected him to be an infidel shendy had
grown in importance since bruce's visit and now consisted of about a
thousand houses considerable trade was carried on grass slaves and
cattle taking the place of specie the principal marketable commodities
were gum ivory gold and ostrich feathers

according to burckhardt the number of slaves sold yearly at shendy
amounts to 5000 2500 of these are for arabia 400 for egypt 1000 for
dongola and the districts of the red sea

the traveller employed his time during his stay at sennaar in
collecting information about that kingdom amongst other curious
things he was told that the king having one day invited the ambassador
of mehemet ali to a cavalry review which he considered rather
formidable the envoy in his turn begged the king to witness part of
the turkish artillery exercises but at the outset of the
performance at the discharge of two small mounted guns cavalry
infantry spectators courtiers and the king himself fled in terror

burckhardt sold his wares and then worn out by the persecutions of
the egyptian merchants who were his companions he joined the caravan
at suakin intending to traverse the unknown district between that town
and shendy from suakin he meant to set out for mecca hoping to find
the hadji useful to him in the realization of his projects

"the hadji" he says "form one powerful body and every member is
protected because if one is attacked the whole number take up arms"
the caravan which burckhardt now joined consisted of 150 merchants and
300 slaves two hundred camels were employed to convey heavy bales of
"danmour" a stuff manufactured in sennaar and cargoes of tobacco

the first object of interest to the travellers was the atbara a
tributary of the nile whose banks with their verdant trees were
grateful to the eye after the sandy desert the course of the river was
followed as far as the fertile district of taka during the journey the
white skin of the pretended sheik ibrahim (it will be remembered that
this was the name assumed by burckhardt) attracted much attention from
the female population who were little accustomed to the sight of
arabs

"one day" relates the traveller "a girl of the country of whom i had
been buying onions offered to give me an extra quantity if i would
remove my turban and show her my head i demanded eight more onions
which she immediately produced as i removed my turban and exposed my
white and close-shaven head to view she sprang back in horror and
dismay i asked her jokingly if she would not like a husband with a
similar head to which she replied with much energy and many
expressions of disgust that she would prefer the ugliest slave ever
brought from darfur"

just before goz radjeh was reached burckhardt's attention was
attracted to a building which he was told was either a church or
temple the same word having the two meanings he at once proceeded in
that direction hoping to examine it but his companions stopped him
saying "it is surrounded by bands of robbers you cannot go a hundred
steps without danger of attack"

burckhardt was unable to decide whether it was an egyptian temple or a
monument of the empire of axum

at last the caravan entered the fertile district of tak or el gasch a
wide watered plain whose soil is wonderfully fertile but which for
two months in the year is uninhabited grain is plentiful and is sold
in jeddah for twenty per cent more than the best egyptian millet

the inhabitants who are called hadendoa are treacherous dishonest
and bloodthirsty and their women are almost as degraded as those of
shendy and berber

upon leaving taka the road to suakin and the shores of the red sea lay
over a chain of chalk hills at schenterab granite is found the hills
presented few difficulties and the caravan reached suakin in safety
upon the 26th may but burckhardt's troubles were not yet at an end
the emir and aga combined to plunder him and treated him as the lowest
of slaves until he produced the firman which he had received from
mehemet ali and ibrahim pasha this changed the face of affairs
instead of being thrown into prison the traveller was invited to the
aga's who offered him a present of a young slave m vivien de saint
martin writes of this expedition "this journey of from twenty to
twenty-five days between the nile and the red sea was the first ever
undertaken by a european the observations collected as to the settled
or nomad tribes of these districts are invaluable for europe
burckhardt's narrative is of increasing interest and few can compare
with it for instruction and interest"

upon the 7th of july burckhardt succeeded in embarking in a boat and
eleven days later he reached jeddah which serves as a harbour to
mecca jeddah is built upon the sea-shore and is surrounded by a wall
which insufficient as it would be against artillery protects it
perfectly from the attacks of the wahabees who have been nicknamed the
"puritans of islamism" these people are a distinct sect who claim to
restore mahomedanism to its primitive simplicity

"the entrance to the town upon the side nearest the sea" says
burckhardt "is protected by a battery which overlooks the entire fort
and is surmounted by one enormous piece of artillery capable of
discharging a five-hundred pound shot which is so renowned throughout
the arabian gulf that its reputation alone is enough to protect
jeddah"

the greatest drawback to this city is its want of fresh water which is
brought from small wells two miles distant without gardens
vegetables or date-trees jeddah in spite of its population of twelve
or fifteen thousand (a number which is doubled in the pilgrimage
season) presents a strange appearance the population is the reverse of
autochthonous it is composed of natives of hadramaut and yemen
indians from surat and bombay and malays who come as pilgrims and
settle in the town burckhardt introduces many anecdotes of interest
into his account of the manners mode of living price of commodities
and number of traders in the place

[illustration merchant of jeddah (fac-simile of early engraving)]

speaking of the singular customs of the natives of jeddah he
says "it is the almost universal custom for everybody to swallow a
cup full of ghee or melted butter in the morning after this they take
coffee which they regard as a strong tonic and they are so accustomed
to this habit from their earliest years that they feel greatly
inconvenienced if they discontinue it the higher classes are satisfied
with drinking the cup of butter but the lower classes add another half
cup which they draw up through the nostrils imagining that they thus
prevent bad air entering the body by those apertures"

the traveller left jeddah for tayf on the 24th of august the road
winds over mountains and across valleys of romantic beauty and
luxuriant verdure burckhardt was taken for an english spy at tayf
and although he was well received by the pasha he had no liberty and
could not carry on his observations

tayf it appears is famous for the beauty of its gardens roses and
grapes are sent from it into all the districts of hedjaz this town had
a considerable trade and was very prosperous before it was plundered
by the wahabees

[illustration shores and boats of the red sea]

the surveillance to which he was subjected hastened burckhardt's
departure and upon the 7th of september he started for mecca well
versed in the study of the koran and acquainted with all the practices
of islamism he was prepared to act the part of a pilgrim his first
care was to dress himself in accordance with the law prescribed for the
faithful who enter mecca in the "ihram" or pieces of cloth without
seam one covering the loins the other thrown over the neck and
shoulders the pilgrim's first duty is to proceed to the temple
without waiting even to procure a lodging this burckhardt did not fail
to do observing at the same time the rites and ceremonies prescribed
in such cases of which he gives many interesting particulars we
cannot however dwell upon them here

"mecca" says burckhardt "may be called a pretty town as a rule the
streets are wider than in most eastern cities the houses are lofty and
built of stone and its numerous windows opening upon the street give
it a more cheerful and european aspect than the cities of egypt or
syria whose dwellings generally have few windows on the outside every
house has a terrace built of stone and sloping in such a way as to
allow water to run down the gutters into the street low walls with
parapets conceal these terraces for as everywhere else in the east
it is not thought right for a man to appear there he would be accused
of spying upon the women who spend much of their time upon the terrace
of the house engaged in domestic work drying corn hanging out linen
&c"

the only public place in the city is the large court of the grand
mosque trees are rare not a garden enlivens the view and the scene
depends for animation upon the well-stocked shops which abound during
the pilgrimage with the exception of four or five large houses
belonging to the administration two colleges which have since been
converted into warehouses for corn and the mosque with the few
buildings and colleges connected with it mecca can boast of no public
buildings and cannot compete in this respect with other cities in the
east of the same size

the streets are unpaved and as drains are unknown water collects in
puddles and the accumulation of mud is inconceivable for a water
supply the natives trust to heaven catching the rain in cisterns for
that obtained from the wells is so foul that it is impossible to drink
it

in the centre of the town where the valley widens a little the mosque
known as beithóu'llah or el haram is situated this edifice owes its
fame to the kaaba which is enclosed in it for other eastern towns can
boast of mosques equally large and more beautiful el haram is situated
in an oblong space surrounded on the eastern side by a quadruple
colonnade and by a triple one on the other the columns are connected
by pointed arches upon each four stand little domes constructed of
mortar and whitened outside some of these columns are of white marble
granite or porphyry but the greater part are of the common stone
found among the mountains of mecca

the kaaba has been so often ruined and restored that no trace of a
remote antiquity remains it was in existence before this mosque was
built

the traveller says "the kaaba is placed upon an inclined base some two
feet high and its roof being flat it presents the appearance at a
little distance of a perfect cube the only door by which it can be
entered and which is opened two or three times a year is on the north
side about seven feet above the ground for which reason one cannot
enter except by means of a wooden staircase the famous 'black stone'
is enshrined at the north-eastern corner of the kaaba near the door
and forms one of the angles of the building four or five feet above the
floor of the court it is difficult to ascertain the exact nature of
this stone as its surface has been completely worn and reduced to its
present condition by the kisses and worshipping touches bestowed upon
it by countless millions of pilgrims the kaaba is entirely covered
with black silk which envelopes its sides leaving the roof exposed
this veil or curtain is called 'the kesoua' and is renewed yearly
during the pilgrimage it is brought from cairo where it is
manufactured at the expense of the viceroy"

up to the time of burckhardt no such detailed account of mecca and her
sanctuary had been given to the world for this reason we shall insert
extracts from the original narrative extracts which might indeed be
multiplied for they include circumstantial accounts of the sacred
well called zemzem water from which is considered as an infallible
remedy for every complaint the traveller speaks also of the "gate of
salvation" of the makam ibrahim a monument containing the stone upon
which abraham sat when he was engaged in building the kaaba and where
the marks of his knees may still be seen and of all the buildings
enclosed within the temple precincts

judging from burckhardt's minute and complete description these spots
still retain their former physiognomy the same number of pilgrims
chant the same songs the men only are no longer the same his accounts
of the feast of the pilgrimage and the holy enthusiasm of the faithful
are followed by a picture which brings before us in the most sombre
colours the effects of this great gathering of men attracted from
every part of the world

"the termination of the pilgrimage" he says "lends a very different
aspect to the mosque illness and death consequent upon the great
fatigues undergone during the voyage are accelerated by the scanty
covering afforded by the ihram the unhealthy dwellings of mecca the
bad food and frequent absolute dearth of provisions the temple is
filled with corpses brought thither to receive the prayers of the iman
or with sick persons who insist upon being carried as their last hours
approach to the colonnade hoping to be saved by the sight of the
kaaba or in any case to have the consolation of expiring within the
sacred precincts one sees poor pilgrims sinking under illness and
hunger dragging their weary bodies along the colonnade and when they
no longer have the strength to stretch out a hand to the passer-by
they place a little jar beside the mat upon which they are laid to
receive what charity may bestow upon them as they feel the last moment
approach they cover themselves with their ragged clothes and very
often a day passes before it is ascertained that they are dead"

we will conclude our extracts from burckhardt's account of mecca with
his opinion of the inhabitants

"although the natives of mecca possess grand qualities although they
are pleasant hospitable cheerful and proud they openly transgress
the koran by drinking gambling and smoking deceit and perjury are no
longer looked upon as crimes by them they do not ignore the scandal
such vices bring upon them but while each individually exclaims
against the corruption of manners none reform themselves"

upon the 15th of january 1815 burckhardt left mecca with a caravan of
pilgrims on their way to visit the tomb of the prophet the journey to
medina like that between mecca and jeddah was accomplished at night
and afforded little opportunity for observation in the winter
night-travelling is less comfortable than travelling by day a valley
called wady-fatme but generally known as el-wadi was crossed it
abounded in shrubs and date-trees and was well cultivated in the
eastern portion a little beyond it lies the valley of es-ssafra the
market of the neighbouring tribes and celebrated for its plantations of
dates

the traveller relates that "the groves of date-trees extend for nearly
four miles and belong to the natives of ssafra as well as to the
bedouins of the neighbourhood who employ labourers to water the
ground and come themselves to reap the harvest the date-trees pass
from one person to another in the course of trade they are sold
separately a father often receives three date-trees as the price of
the daughter he gives in marriage they are all planted in deep sand
brought from the middle of the valley and piled up over their roots
they ought to be renewed every year and they are generally swept away
by the torrents each little plot is surrounded by a wall of mud or
stone and the cultivators live in hamlets or isolated cabins among the
trees the principal stream flows through a grove near the market
beside it rises a little mosque shaded by large chestnuts i had seen
none before in the hedjaz"

burckhardt was thirteen days in reaching medina but this rather long
journey was not lost time to him he collected much information about
the arabs and the wahabees at medina as at mecca the pilgrim's first
duty is to visit the tomb and mosque of mahomet but the ceremonies
attending the visit are much easier and shorter and the traveller
performed them in a quarter of an hour

burckhardt's stay at mecca had already been prejudicial to him at
medina he was attacked by intermittent fever which increased in
violence and was accompanied by violent sickness this soon so reduced
him that he could no longer rise from his carpet without the
assistance of his slave "a poor fellow who by nature and habit was
more fit to tend camels than to take care of his worn-out and enfeebled
master"

burckhardt being detained at medina for more than three months by a
fever due to bad climate the detestable quality of the water and the
prevalence of infectious illnesses was forced to relinquish his
project of crossing the desert to akabah in order to reach yanibo as
quickly as possible and from thence embark for egypt

"next to aleppo" he says "medina is the best-built town i have seen
in the east it is entirely of stone the houses being generally three
stories high with flat tops as they are not whitewashed and the
stone is brown in colour the streets which are very narrow have
usually a sombre appearance they are often only two or three paces
wide at the present time medina looks desolate enough the houses are
falling into ruins their owners who formerly derived a considerable
profit from the inroad of pilgrims find their revenues diminishing as
the wahabees forbid visitors to the tomb of the prophet alleging that
he was but a mere mortal the possession which places medina on a par
with mecca is the grand mosque containing the tomb of mahomet this is
smaller than that at mecca but is built upon the same plan in a large
square courtyard surrounded on all sides by covered galleries and
having a small building in the centre the famous tomb surrounded by
an iron railing painted green is near the eastern corner it is of
good workmanship in imitation of filagree and interlaced with
inscriptions in copper four doors of which three lead into this
enclosure are kept constantly shut permission to enter is freely
accorded to persons of rank and others can purchase permission of the
principal eunuchs for about fifteen piasters in the interior are
hangings which surround the tomb and are only a few feet from it"
according to the historian of medina these hangings cover a square
edifice built of black stones and supported upon two columns in the
interior of which are the sepulchres of mahomet and his two eldest
disciples abou-bekr and omar he also states that these sepulchres are
deep holes and that the coffin which contains the ashes of mahomet is
covered with silver and surmounted by a marble slab with the
inscription "in the name of god give him thy pity" the fables which
were spread throughout europe as to the tomb of the prophet being
suspended in mid air are unknown in the hedjaz the mosque was robbed
of a great part of its treasures by the wahabees but there is some
ground for believing that they had been forestalled by the successive
guardians of the tomb

many other interesting details of medina and its inhabitants
surroundings and the haunts of pilgrims are to be found in
burckhardt's narrative but we have given sufficient extracts to induce
the reader who desires further information respecting the manners and
customs of the arabs which have not changed to refer to the book
itself

upon the 21st of april 1815 burckhardt joined a caravan which
conducted him to yembo where the plague was raging the traveller at
once fell ill and became so weak that it was impossible for him to
resort to a country place to embark was equally impossible all the
vessels which were ready to start were crowded with soldiers he was
compelled to remain eighteen days in the unhealthy little town before
he could obtain a passage in a small vessel which took him to cosseir
and thence to egypt

upon his return to cairo burckhardt heard of his father's death the
traveller's constitution had been sorely tried by illness and he was
unable to attempt the ascent of mount sinai until 1816 the study of
natural history the publication of his diary and his correspondence
occupied him until 1817 at which time he expected to go with a caravan
to fezzan unfortunately he succumbed to a sudden attack of fever his
last words being "write and tell my mother that my last thought was of
her"

burckhardt was an accomplished traveller well-informed exact to
minuteness patient courageous and endowed with an upright and
energetic character his writings are of great value the narrative of
his voyage in arabia of which he unfortunately could not explore the
interior is so complete and precise that owing to it that country was
then better known than many in europe

in writing to his father from cairo on the 13th of march 1817 he
says "i have never said a word about what i have seen and met with
that my conscience did not entirely justify i did not expose myself to
so much danger in order to write a romance"

the explorers who have succeeded him in the same countries unanimously
testify to his exactness and agree in praising his fidelity
knowledge and sagacity

"few travellers" says the revue germanique "have enjoyed in a like
degree the faculty of observation that is a rare gift of nature like
all eminent qualities he possessed a sort of intuition which discerned
the truth apart from his own observations and thus information given
by him from hearsay has a value that seldom attaches to statements of
that nature his mind early ripened by reflection and study (he was
but in his thirty-third year at the time of his death) invariably went
straight to the point his narrative always sober is filled one may
say rather with things than words yet his narratives possess infinite
charm one admires the man in them as much as the savant and observer"

while the biblical countries occupied the attention of seetzen and
burckhardt india the birthplace of most of the european languages
was about to command the attention of students of language literature
and religion as well as of geography for the present our concern is
with those problems of physical geography which the conquests and
studies of the india company were about to solve by degrees

in a preceding volume we have related how the portuguese rule was
established in india the union of portugal with spain in 1599 led to
the fall of the portuguese colonies which came into the possession of
the english and dutch england soon afterwards granted a monopoly of
the commerce of india to a company which was destined to play an
important part in history

at this time akbar the great mogul emperor the seventh descendant of
timour leng had established a vast empire in hindustan and bengal
upon the ruins of the rajpoot kingdoms owing to the personal qualities
of akbar which had gained for him the surname of the benefactor of
man that empire was at the height of its glory the same brilliant
course was pursued by shah jehan but akbar's grandson aurung zeb
inspired by an insatiable ambition assassinated his brothers
imprisoned his father and seized the reins of government while the
mogul empire was in the enjoyment of profound peace a clever
adventurer laid the foundations of the mahratta empire the religious
intolerance of aurung zeb and his crafty policy led to the
insurrection of the rajpoots and a struggle which by draining the
resources of the empire shook his power the death of the great
usurper was followed by the decadence of the empire

up to this period the india company had been unable to add to the
narrow strip of territory which they possessed at the ports but it was
now to benefit by the conflict between the nabobs and rajahs of
hindustan it was not however until after the taking of madras in
1746 by la bourdonnais and the struggle against dupleix that the
influence and dominion of the english company was materially increased

the crafty policy of clive and hastings the english governors who
successively employed force stratagem and bribery to attain their
ends laid the foundation of british greatness in india and at the
close of the last century the company were possessors of an immense
extent of country with no less than sixty millions of inhabitants
their territory included bengal behar the provinces of benares
madras and the sircars tippoo saib alone the sultan of mysore
struggled against the english encroachments but he was unable to hold
out against the coalition formed against him by the skill of colonel
wellesley when rid of their formidable enemies the company overcame
such opposition as remained by pensions and under the pretext of
protection imposed upon the rajahs an english garrison which was
maintained at their expense

one would imagine from all this that the english rule was detested but
that is not the case the company recognizing the rights of
individuals did not attempt to change the religion laws or customs
of their subjects neither is it surprising that travellers even when
they ventured into districts which properly speaking did not belong
to great britain incurred but little danger in fact so soon as the
east india company was free from political embarrassments it
encouraged explorers throughout its vast domains at the same time
travellers were despatched to the neighbouring territories to collect
observations and we propose rapidly to review those expeditions

morieu]

one of the first and most curious was that of webb to the sources of
the ganges a river concerning which uncertain and contradictory
opinions prevailed the government of bengal recognizing the great
importance of the ganges in the interests of commerce organized an
expedition of which messrs webb roper and hearsay formed part
they were to be accompanied by sepoys native servants and
interpreters

the expedition reached herdouar a small village on the left of the
river upon the 1st of april 1808 the situation of this village at
the entrance of the fertile plains of hindustan had caused it to be
much frequented by pilgrims and it was at this spot that purifications
in the waters of the holy river took place during the hot season

as every pilgrimage implies the sale of relics herdouar was the centre
of an important market where horses camels antimony asafoetida
dried fruits shawls arrows muslins cotton and woollen goods from
the punjab cabulistan and cashmere were to be had slaves too were
to be bought there from three to thirty years of age at prices varying
from 10 to 150 rupees this fair where such different races
languages and costumes were to be met with presented a curious
spectacle

upon the 12th of april the english expedition set out for gangautri
following a road planted with white mulberries and figs as far as
gourondar a little farther on water-mills of simple construction were
at work upon the banks of streams shaded with willows and
raspberry-trees the soil was fertile but the tyranny of the
government prevented the natives from making the best of it

the route soon became mountainous but peach apricot nut and other
european trees abounded and at length the expedition found themselves
in the midst of a chain of mountains which appeared to belong to the
himalaya range

the baghirati which is known further on as the ganges was met with at
the end of a pass to the left the river is bounded by high almost
barren mountains to the right stretches a fertile valley at the
village of tchiavli the poppy is largely cultivated for the
preparation of opium here owing probably to the bad quality of the
water all the peasants suffer from wens

at djosvara the travellers had to cross a bridge of rope called a
"djorila" this was a strange and perilous structure

"on either side of the river" says webb "two strong poles are driven
in at a distance of two feet from each other and across them is
placed another piece of wood to this is attached a dozen or more thick
ropes which are held down upon the ground by large heaps of wood they
are divided into two packets about a foot apart blow hangs a ladder
of rope knotted to one of these which answers instead of a parapet
the flooring of the bridge is composed of small branches of trees
placed at intervals of two and a half or three feet from each other
as these are generally slender they seem as if they were on the point
of breaking every moment which naturally induces the traveller to
depend upon the support of the ropes which form the parapet and to
keep them constantly under their arms the first step taken upon so
shaky a structure is sufficient to cause giddiness for the action of
walking makes it swing to either side and the noise of the torrent
over which it is suspended is not reassuring moreover the bridge is so
narrow that if two persons meet upon it one must draw completely to
the side to make room for the other"

[illustration bridge of rope]

the expedition afterwards passed through the town of baharat where but
few of the houses have been rebuilt since the earthquake of 1803 this
locality has always enjoyed a certain importance from the fact that a
market is held there and also on account of the difficulty of
obtaining provisions in the towns higher up as well as from its
central position the routes to jemauhi kedar nath and sirinagur all
meet there

beyond batheri the road became so bad that the travellers were obliged
to abandon their baggage there was a mere path-track by the edge of
precipices amid débris of stones and rocks and the attempt to proceed
was soon relinquished

devaprayaga is situated at the junction of the baghirati and the
aluknanda the first coming from the north hurries along with noise
and impetuosity the second broader deeper and more tranquil rises
no less than forty-six feet above its ordinary level in the rainy
season the junction of these two rivers forms the ganges and is a
sacred spot from which the brahmins draw considerable profit as they
have arranged pools there where for a certain price pilgrims can
perform their ablutions without danger of being carried away by the
current

the aluknanda was crossed by means of a running bridge or "dindla"
which is thus described 

"this bridge consists of three or four large ropes fixed upon either
bank and upon these a small seat some eighteen inches square is slung
by means of hoops at either end upon this seat the traveller takes his
place and is drawn from one side of the river to the other by a rope
pulled by the man upon the opposite bank"

the expedition reached sirinagur upon the 13th of may the curiosity of
the inhabitants had been so much excited that the magistrates sent a
message to the english begging them to march through the town

sirinagur which had been visited by colonel hardwick in 1796 had been
almost completely destroyed by the earthquake of 1803 and had in the
same year been conquered by the gorkhalis here webb was joined by the
emissaries whom he had sent to gangautri by the route which he himself
had been unable to follow and who had visited the source of the
ganges

"a large rock" he says "on either side of which water flows and
which is very shallow roughly resembles the body and mouth of a cow a
cavity at one end of its surface gave rise to its name of gaoumokhi
the mouth of the cow who by its fancied resemblance is popularly
supposed to vomit the water of the sacred river a little farther on
advance is impossible a mountain as steep as a wall rises in front
the ganges appeared to issue from the snow which lay at its feet the
valley terminated here no one has ever gone any farther"

the expedition returned by a different route it met with the
tributaries of the ganges and of the keli ganga or mandacni rivers
rising in the mountains of kerdar immense flocks of goats and sheep
laden with grain were met with numbers of defiles crossed and after
passing the towns of badrinath and manah the expedition finally reached
the cascade of barson in the midst of heavy snow and intense cold

"this" says webb's narrative "is the goal of the devotions of the
pilgrims some of them come here to be sprinkled by the sacred spray of
the cascade at this spot the course of the aluknanda may be traced as
far as the south-western extremity of the valley but its source is
hidden under heaps of snow which have probably been accumulating for
centuries"

webb furnishes some details respecting the women of manah they wore
necklaces earrings and gold and silver ornaments which were scarcely
in keeping with their coarse attire some of the children wore
necklaces and bracelets of silver to the value of six hundred rupees

in winter this town which does a great trade with thibet is
completely buried in snow and the natives take refuge in neighbouring
towns

the expedition visited the temple at badrinath which is far-famed for
its sanctity neither its internal nor external structure or appearance
give any idea of the immense sums which are expended upon it it is one
of the oldest and most venerated sanctuaries of india ablutions are
performed there in reservoirs fed with very warm sulphureous water

"there are" says the narrative "a great number of hot springs each
having their special name and virtue and from all of them doubtless
the brahmins derive profit for this reason the poor pilgrim as he
gets through the requisite ablutions finds his purse diminish with the
number of his sins and the many tolls exacted from him upon the road
to paradise might induce him to consider the narrow way by no means the
least expensive one this temple possesses seven hundred villages
which have either been ceded to it by government given as security for
loans or bought by private individuals and given as offerings"

the expedition reached djosimah on the 1st of june there the brahmin
who acted as guide received orders from the government of nepaul to
conduct the travellers back immediately to the territories of the
company the government had discovered a little late it must be
admitted that the english explorations had a political as well as a
geographical significance a month afterwards webb and his companions
entered delhi having definitely settled the course of the ganges and
ascertained the sources of the baghirati and aluknanda in fact having
attained the object which the company had had in view

in 1808 the english government decided upon sending a new mission to
the punjab then under the dominion of runjeet sing the anonymous
narrative of this expedition published in the "annales des voyages"
offers some particulars of interest from which we will extract a few

upon the 6th of april 1808 an english officer in charge of the
expedition reached herdonai which he represents as the rendezvous of
a million individuals at the time of the yearly fair at boria which
is situated between the jumna and the sutlej the traveller was an
object of much curiosity to the women who begged permission to come
and see him

"their looks and gestures" says the narrative "sufficiently expressed
their surprise they approached me laughing heartily the colour of my
face amused them extremely they addressed many questions to me asking
me whether i never wore a hat whether i exposed my face to the sun
whether i remained continually shut up or only walked out under
shelter and whether i slept upon the table placed in my tent although
my bed occupied one side of it the curtains were however closed
they then examined it in detail together with the lining of my tent
and everything belonging to it these women were all good-looking with
mild and regular features their complexion was olive and contrasted
agreeably with their white and even teeth which are a distinguishing
feature of all the inhabitants of the punjab"

mustafabad mulana and umballa were visited in succession by the
british officer the country through which he passed was inhabited by
sikhs a race remarkable for benevolence hospitality and
truthfulness the author of the narrative is of opinion that they are
the finest race of men in india puttiala makeonara fegonara
oudamitta which lord lake entered in 1805 in his pursuit of a mahratta
chief and finally amritsur were stages easily passed

amritsur is better built than the generality of towns in hindustan it
is the largest depôt of shawls and saffron as well as other articles of
deccan merchandise the traveller says 

"upon the 14th having put white shoes on my feet i paid a visit to
the amritsur or reservoir of the elixir of immortality from whence the
city derives its name it is a reservoir of about 135 feet square
built of brick and in the centre is a pretty temple dedicated to
gourogovind sing a footpath leads to it it is decorated both within
and without and the rajah often adds to its stores by gifts of
ornaments in this sacred receptacle the book of the laws written by
gouron in the 'gourou moukhtis' character is placed this temple is
called hermendel or the dwelling of god some 600 priests are attached
to its service and comfortable dwellings are provided for them out of
the voluntary contributions of the devotees who visit the temple
although the priests are regarded with infinite respect they are not
absolutely free from vice when they have money they spend it as
freely as they have gained it the number of pretty women who daily
repair to the temple is very great they far excel the women of the
inferior classes in hindustan in the elegance of their manners their
fine proportions and handsome features"

lahore was next visited by the officer it is interesting to know what
remained of that fine city at the commencement of the present century
the narrative says 

"its very high walls are ornamented externally with all the profusion
of eastern taste but they are falling into ruins as are also the
mosques and houses inside the town time has laid its destructive hand
upon this city as upon delhi and agra the ruins of lahore are already
as extensive as those of that ancient capital"

three days after his arrival the traveller was received with great
politeness by runjeet sing who conversed with him principally upon
military topics the rajah was then twenty-seven years of age his
countenance would have been pleasant had not the small-pox deprived
him of one eye his manners were simple affable and yet kingly after
paying visits to the tomb of shah jehan to the schalamar and other
monuments at lahore the officer returned to delhi and the possessions
of the company to his visit was due that better knowledge of the
country which could not fail to tempt the ambition of the english
government

the following year (1809) an embassy consisting of messrs nicholas
hankey smith henry ellis robert taylor and henry pottinger was sent
to the emirs of scinde the escort was commanded by captain charles
christie

the mission was transported to keratchy by boat the governor of that
fort refused to allow the embassy to disembark without instructions
from the emirs an interchange of correspondence ensued as a result of
which the envoy smith drew attention to certain improprieties
relating to the title and respective rank of the governor-general and
the emirs the governor excused himself upon the ground of his
ignorance of the persian language and said that not wishing a cause
of misunderstanding to exist he was quite ready to kill or put out the
eyes (as the envoy pleased) of the person who had written the letter
this declaration appeared sufficient to the english who deprecated the
execution of the guilty person

in their letters the emirs affected a tone of contemptuous superiority
at the same time they brought a body of 8000 men within reach and put
every possible difficulty in the way of the english efforts to procure
information after tedious negotiations in the course of which british
pride was humbled more than once the embassy received permission to
start for hyderabad

above keratchy which is the principal export harbour of scinde a vast
plain without trees or vegetation extends along the coast five days
are necessary to cross this and reach tatah the ancient capital of
scinde then ruined and deserted formerly it was brought into
communication by means of canals with the sind an immense river
which is at its mouth in reality an arm of the sea pottinger
collected the most precise complete and useful details respecting the
sind which were then known

it had been arranged beforehand that the embassy should find a
plausible excuse for separating and reaching hyderabad by two different
routes in order to obtain geographical information on the country the
city was soon reached and the same difficult negotiations about the
reception of the embassy who refused to submit to the humiliating
exactions of the emirs had to be gone through pottinger thus
describes the arrival at hyderabad "the precipice upon which the
eastern façade of the fortress of hyderabad is situated the roofs of
the houses and even the fortifications were thronged by a multitude
of both sexes who testified friendly feeling towards us by acclamation
and applause upon reaching the palace where they were to dismount
the english were met by ouli mahommed khan and other eminent officers
who walked before us towards a covered platform at the extremity of
which the emirs were seated this platform being covered with the
richest persian carpet we took off our shoes from the moment the
envoy took the first step towards the princes they all three rose and
remained standing until he reached the place pointed out to him an
embroidered cloth which distinguished him from the rest of the
embassy the princes addressed to each of us polite questions
respecting our health as it was a purely ceremonial reception
everything went off well with compliments and polite expressions

"the emirs wore a great number of precious stones in addition to those
which ornamented the hilts and scabbards of their swords and daggers
and emeralds and rubies of extraordinary size shone at their girdles
they were seated according to age the eldest in the centre the second
to his right the youngest on the left a carpet of light felt covered
the entire circle and over this was a mattress of silk about an inch
thick exactly large enough to accommodate the three princes"

[illustration "they were seated according to age"]

the narrative concludes with a description of hyderabad a fortress
which would have scarcely been able to offer any resistance to a
european enemy and with various reflections upon the nature of the
embassy which had amongst other aims the closing of the entrance of
scinde against the french the treaty concluded the english returned
to bombay

by this expedition the east india company gained a better knowledge of
one of the neighbouring kingdoms and collected precious documents
relating to the resources and productions of a country traversed by an
immense river the indus of the ancients which rises in the himalayas
and might readily serve to transport the products of an immense
territory the end gained was perhaps rather political than
geographical but science profited once more by political needs

hitherto the little knowledge that had been gained of the regions lying
between cabulistan india and persia had been as incomplete as it was
defective

the company thoroughly satisfied with the manner in which captain
christie and lieutenant pottinger had accomplished their embassy
resolved to confide to them a delicate and difficult mission they were
to rejoin general malcolm ambassador to persia by crossing
beluchistan and in so doing to collect more accurate and precise
details of that vast extent of country than had hitherto been acquired

it was useless to think of crossing beluchistan with its fanatic
population in european dress christie and pottinger therefore had
recourse to a hindu merchant who provided horses on behalf of the
governments of madras and bombay and accredited them as his agents to
kelat the capital of beluchistan

upon the 2nd of january 1810 the two officers embarked at bombay for
someany the sole sea-port of the province of lhossa which they
reached after a stay at poorbunder on the coast of guzerat

the entire country traversed by the travellers before they arrived at
bela was a morass interspersed with jungle the "djam" or governor of
that town was an intelligent man he put numerous questions to the
english by which he showed a desire to learn and then confided the
task of conducting the travellers to kelat to the chief of the tribe
of bezendjos who are belutchis

[illustration beluchistan warriors (fac-simile of early engraving)]

the climate had changed since they left bombay and in the mountains
pottinger and christie experienced cold sufficiently keen to freeze the
water in the leather bottles

"kelat" says pottinger "the capital of the whole of beluchistan
whence it derives its name kelat or the city is situated upon a
height to the west of a well-cultivated plain or valley eight miles
long and three wide the greater portion of this is laid out in
gardens the town forms a square it is surrounded on three sides by a
mud wall about twenty feet high flanked at distances of 250 feet by
bastions which like the walls are pierced with a large number of
barbicans for musketry i had no opportunity of visiting the interior
of the palace but it consists merely of a confused mass of mud
buildings with flat roofs like terraces the whole is defended by low
walls furnished with parapets and pierced with barbicans there are
about 2500 houses in the town and nearly half as many in the suburbs
they are built of half-baked bricks and wood the whole smeared over
with mud the streets as a rule are larger than those in towns
inhabited by asiatics they usually have a raised footway on either
side for pedestrians in the centre an open stream which is rendered
very unpleasant by the filth and rubbish thrown into it and by the
stagnant rainwater which collects for there is no regulation insisting
upon it being cleaned another obstacle to the cleanliness and comfort
of the town exists in the projection of the upper stories of the
houses which makes the under buildings damp and dark the bazaar of
kelat is very large and well stocked with every kind of merchandize
every day it is supplied with provisions vegetables and all kinds of
food which are cheap"

according to pottinger's account the population is divided into two
distinct classes the belutchis and the brahouis and each of these is
subdivided into a number of tribes the first is related to the modern
persian both in appearance and speech the brahoui on the contrary
retains a great number of hindu words intermarriage between the two
has given rise to a third

the belutchis coming from the mountains of mekram are "tunnites"
that is to say they consider the first four imans as the legitimate
successors of mahomet

they are a pastoral people and have the faults and virtues of their
class if they are hospitable they are also indolent and pass their
time in gambling and smoking as a rule they content themselves with
one or two wives and are less jealous of their being seen by strangers
than are other mussulmen they have a large number of slaves of both
sexes whom they treat humanely they are excellent marksmen and
passionately fond of hunting brave under all circumstances they take
pleasure in "razzias" which they call "tchépaos" as a rule these
expeditions are undertaken by the nherouis the wildest and most
thievish of the belutchis

the brahouis carry their wandering habits still farther few men are
more active and strong they endure the glacial cold of the mountains
equally with the burning heat of the plains they are of small stature
but as brave as skilful in shooting as faithful to their promises as
the belutchis and have not so pronounced a taste for plunder

pottinger says "i have seen no asiatic people whom they resemble for
a large number have brown hair and beards"

after a short stay at kelat the two travellers who still passed as
horse-dealers resolved to continue their journey but instead of
following the high road to kandahar they crossed a dreary and barren
country ill-populated watered by the caisser a river which dries up
during the summer and they reached a little town called noschky or
nouchky on the frontier of afghanistan

at this place the belutchis who appeared friendly represented to
them the great difficulty of reaching khorassan and its capital herat
by way of sedjistan they advised the travellers to try to reach kerman
by way of kedje and benpor or by serhed a village on the western
frontier of beluchistan and from thence to enter nermanchir at the
same moment the idea of following two distinct routes presented itself
to both christie and pottinger this course was contrary to their
instructions "but" said pottinger "we found a ready excuse in the
unquestionable advantage which would result from our procuring more
extensive geographical and statistical knowledge of the country we were
sent to explore than we could hope to do by travelling together"

christie set out first by way of douchak we shall follow his fortunes
hereafter

a few days later while still at noutch pottinger received letters
from his correspondent at kelat telling him that the emirs of scinde
were searching for them as they had been recognized and that his best
plan for safety was to set out immediately

upon the 25th of march pottinger started for serawan a very small town
near the afghan frontier upon his way thither pottinger met with some
singular altars or tombs the construction of which was attributed to
the ghebers or fire-worshippers who are known in our day as parsees

serawan is six miles from the serawani mountains in a sterile and bare
district this town owes its existence to the constant supply of water
it derives from the beli an inestimable advantage in a country
constantly exposed to drought scarcity and famine

pottinger afterwards visited the kharan celebrated for the strength
and activity of its camels and crossed the desert which forms the
southern extremity of afghanistan the sand of this desert is so fine
that its particles are almost impalpable and the action of the wind
causes it to accumulate into heaps ten or twenty feet high divided by
deep valleys even in calm weather a great number of particles float in
the air giving rise to a mirage of a peculiar kind and getting into
the traveller's eyes mouth and nostrils cause an excessive
irritation with an insatiable thirst

in all this territory pottinger personated a "pyrzadeh" or holy man
for the natives are of a very thievish disposition and in the
character of a merchant he might have been involved in unpleasant
adventures after leaving the village of goul in the district of
daizouk the traveller passed through the ruined towns of asmanabad
hefter and pourah where pottinger was forced to admit that he was a
"feringhi" to the great scandal of the guide who during the two
months they had been together had never doubted him and to whom he had
given many proofs of sanctity

at last worn out by fatigue and at the end of his resources
pottinger reached benpor a locality which had been visited in 1808 by
mr grant a captain in the bengal sepoy infantry encouraged by the
excellent account given by that officer pottinger presented himself to
the serdar but instead of affording him the necessary help for the
prosecution of his journey that functionary discontented with the
small present pottinger offered him found means to extort from him a
pair of pistols which would have been of great use to him

basman is the last inhabited town of beluchistan at this spot there is
a hot sulphureous spring which the belutchis consider a certain cure
for cutaneous diseases

the frontiers of persia are far from "scientific" hence a large tract
of country remains not neutral but a subject of dispute and is the
scene of sanguinary contests

the little town of regan in nermanchir is very pretty it is a fort
or rather a fortified village surrounded by high walls in good
repair and furnished with bastions

further on in persia proper lies benn a town which was formerly of
importance as the ruins which surround it sufficiently prove here
pottinger was cordially received by the governor

"on approaching" says pottinger "he turned to one of his suite and
asked where the 'feringhi' was i was pointed out to him making me a
sign to follow him his fixed look at me which took me in from head to
foot proclaimed his astonishment at my costume which in truth was
strange enough to serve as an excuse for the impoliteness of his
staring i was wearing the long shirt of a belutchi and a pair of
trousers which had once been white but which in the six weeks i had
worn them had become brown and were all but in rags in addition to
this i had on a blue turban a piece of rope served me as a girdle and
i carried in my hand a thick stick which had assisted me greatly in my
walking and protected me from dogs"

in spite of the dilapidated appearance of the tatterdemalion who thus
presented himself before him the governor received pottinger with as
much cordiality as was to be expected from a mussulman and provided
him with a guide to kerman the traveller reached that town upon the
3rd of may feeling that he had accomplished the most difficult portion
of his journey and was almost in safety

kerman is the capital of ancient karamania under the afghan rule it
was a flourishing town and manufactured shawls which rivalled those of
cashmere

here pottinger witnessed one of those spectacles which common enough
to countries where human life is of little value always fill europeans
with horror and disgust the governor of this town was both son-in-law
and nephew of the shah and also the son of the shah's wife "upon the
15th of may" says pottinger "the prince himself judged certain
persons who were accused of killing one of their servants it is
difficult to estimate the state of restlessness and alarm which
prevailed in the village during the entire day the gates of the town
were shut that no one might pass out the government officials did not
transact any business people were cited as witnesses without previous
notice i saw two or three taken to the palace in a state of agitation
which could scarcely have been greater had they been going to the
scaffold about three in the afternoon the prince passed sentence upon
those who had been convicted some had their eyes put out some the
tongue split some had the ears nose and lips cut off others were
deprived of their hands fingers or toes i learned that whilst these
horrible punishments were inflicted the prince remained seated at the
window where i had seen him and gave his orders without the least sign
of compassion or of horror at the scene which took place before him"

leaving kerman pottinger reached cheré bebig which is equally distant
from yezd shiraz and kerman and thence proceeded to ispahan where
he had the pleasure of finding his companion christie at meragha he
met general malcolm it was now seven months since they had left
bombay christie had traversed 2250 miles and pottinger 2412
meanwhile christie had accomplished his perilous journey much better
than he had anticipated

leaving noutch upon the 22nd of march he crossed the vachouty
mountains and some uncultivated country to the banks of the helmend a
river which flows into lake hamoun

christie in his report to the company says 

"the helmend after passing near kandahar flows south-west and west
and enters sedjestan some four days march from douchak making a détour
around the mountains it finally forms a lake at peldalek which we
visited it is about 1200 feet in width and very deep the water is
very good the country is cultivated by irrigation for half a mile on
either side then the desert begins and rises in perpendicular cliffs
the banks of the river abound in tamarind-trees and provide pasturage
for cattle"

sedjestan which is watered by this river comprises only 500 square
miles the portions of this district which are inhabited are those upon
the river helmend whose bed deepens every year

at elemdar christie sent for a hindu to whom he had an introduction
this man advised him to dismiss his belutchi attendants and to
personate a pilgrim a few days later he penetrated to douchak now
known as jellalabad he says 

"the ruins of the ancient city cover quite as large a space of ground
as ispahan it was built like all the towns of sedjistan of
half-burned bricks the houses being two stories high with vaulted
roofs the modern town of jellalabad is clean pretty and growing it
contains nearly 2000 houses and a fair bazaar" the road from douchak
to herat was easy christie's sole difficulty was in carrying out his
personation of a pilgrim herat lies in a valley surrounded by high
mountains and watered by a river to which it is due that gardens and
orchards abound the town covers an area of about four square miles it
is surrounded by a wall flanked with towers and a moat full of water
large bazaars containing numerous shops and the mechedé djouna or
mosque of friday are its chief ornaments

no town has less waste land or a denser population christie estimates
it at 100000 herat is the most commercial of all asiatic towns under
the dominion of native princes it is the depôt for all the traffic
between cabul candahar hindustan cashmere and persia and itself
produces choice merchandize silks saffron horses and asafoetida

"this plant" says christie "grows to a height of two or three feet
the stalk is two inches thick it finishes off in an umbel which at
maturity is yellow and not unlike a cauliflower it is much relished
by hindus and belutchis they prepare it for eating by cooking the
stalks in ashes and boiling the head like other vegetables but it
always retains its pungent smell and taste" herat like so many other
eastern towns possesses beautiful public gardens but they are only
cultivated for the sake of the produce which is sold in the bazaar
after a stay of a month at herat disguised as a horse-dealer
christie announcing that he would return after a pilgrimage to meshid
which he contemplated left the town he directed his course to yezd
across a country ravaged by the osbeks who had destroyed the tanks
intended to receive the rain-water

yezd is a large and populous town on the skirts of a desert of sand it
is called "dar-oul-ehabet" or "the seat of adoration" it is celebrated
for the security to be enjoyed there which contributes largely to the
development of its trade with hindustan khorassan persia and bagdad
christie describes the bazaar as large and well stocked the town
contains 20000 houses apart from those belonging to the ghebers who
are estimated at 4000 they are an active and laborious people
although cruelly oppressed from yezd to ispahan where he alighted at
the palace of the emir oud-daoulé christie had travelled a distance of
170 miles upon a good road

at yezd as we have seen he met his companion pottinger the two
friends could but exchange mutual congratulations at the accomplishment
of their mission and their escape from the dangers of a fanatical
country

pottinger's narrative as may perhaps be gathered from the sketch we
have given was very curious more exact than most of his predecessors
he had collected and offered to the public a mass of most interesting
historical facts anecdotes and geographical descriptions

cabulistan had been from the middle of the eighteenth century the
scene of a succession of ruinous civil wars competitors with more or
less right to the throne had carried fire and sword everywhere and
converted that rich and fertile province into a desert where the
remains of ruined cities alone bore witness to former prosperity

about the year 1808 the throne of cabul was occupied by
soojah-oul-moulk england uneasy at the projects formed by napoleon
with a view of attacking her possessions in india and at the offers of
alliance made by him through general gardane to the shah of persia
resolved to send an embassy to the court of cabul hoping to gain the
king over to the interests of the east india company

mountstuart elphinstone was selected as envoy and has left an
interesting account of his mission he collected much novel information
concerning this region and the tribes by which it is peopled his book
acquires a new interest in our own day and we turn with pleasure to
pages devoted to the khyberis and other mountain tribes amid the
events which are now taking place

leaving delhi in october 1808 elphinstone reached kanun where the
desert commences and then the shekhawuttée a district inhabited by
rajpoots at the end of october the embassy arrived at singuana a
pretty town the rajah of which was an inveterate opium-smoker he is
described as a small man with large eyes much inflamed by the use of
opium his beard which was curled up to his ears on each side gave
him a ferocious appearance

djounjounka whose gardens give freshness in the midst of these desert
regions is not now a dependency of the rajah of bekaneer whose
revenues do not exceed 1250000 francs how is it possible for that
prince to collect such revenues from a desert and uncultivated
territory overrun by myriads of rats flocks of gazelles and herds of
wild asses?

the path across the sand-hills was so narrow that two camels abreast
could scarcely pass it at the least deviation from the path those
animals would sink in the sand as if it had been snow so that the
smallest difficulty with the head of the column delayed the entire
caravan those in front could not advance if those in the rear were
delayed and lest they should lose sight of the guides trumpets and
drums were employed as signals to prevent separation

one could almost fancy it the march of an army the warlike sounds the
brilliant uniforms and arms were scarcely calculated to convey the
idea of a peaceful embassy the envoy speaks of the want of water and
the bad quality of that which was procurable was unbearable to the
soldiers and servants although they quenched their thirst with the
abundant water-melons they could not do so without ill results to
their health most of the natives of india who accompanied the embassy
suffered from low fever and dysentery forty persons died during the
first week's stay at bekaneer la fontaine's description of the
floating sticks might be aptly applied to bekaneer "from afar off it
is something near at hand it is nought" the external appearance of
the town is pleasant but it is a mere disorderly collection of cabins
enclosed by mud walls

at that time the country was invaded by five armies and the
belligerents sent a succession of envoys to the english ambassador
hoping to obtain if not substantial assistance at least moral
support elphinstone was received by the rajah of bekaneer "this
court" he says "was different from all i had seen elsewhere in india
the men were whiter than the hindus resembled jews in feature and
wore magnificent turbans the rajah and his relatives wore caps of
various colours adorned with precious stones

"the rajah leant upon a steel buckler the centre of which was raised
and the border encrusted with diamonds and rubies shortly after our
entrance the rajah proposed that we should retire from the heat and
importunity of the crowd we took our seats on the ground according to
indian custom and the rajah delivered a discourse in which he said he
was the vassal of the sovereign of delhi and that as delhi was in the
possession of the british he honoured the sovereignty of my government
in my person

"he caused the keys of the fort to be brought to him and handed them to
me but having received no instructions regarding such an event i
refused them after much persuasion the rajah consented to keep his
keys shortly afterwards a troop of bayadères came in and dancing and
singing continued until we took our leave"

[illustration "a troop of bayadères came in"]

upon leaving bekaneer the travellers entered a desert in the middle of
which stand the cities of monyghur and bahawulpore where a compact
crowd awaited the embassy the hyphases upon which alexander's fleet
sailed scarcely answered to the idea such a reminiscence inspires
upon the morrow bahaweel-khan governor of one of the eastern provinces
of cabul arrived bringing magnificent presents for the english
ambassador whom he conducted by the river hyphases as far as moultan
a town famous for its silk manufactures the governor of the town had
been terror-struck at hearing of the approach of the english and there
had been a discussion as to the attitude it was to assume and whether
the latter intended to take the town by stratagem or to demand its
surrender when these fears were allayed a cordial welcome followed

elphinstone's description if somewhat exaggerated is not the less
curious after describing how the governor saluted mr strachey the
secretary to the embassy after the persian custom he adds "they
took their way together towards the tent and the disorder increased
some were wrestling others on horseback mixed with the pedestrians
mr strachey's horse was nearly thrown to the ground and the secretary
regained his equilibrium with difficulty the khan and his suite
mistook the road in approaching the tent and threw themselves upon the
cavalry with such impetuosity that the latter had scarcely time to face
about and let them pass the disordered troops fell back upon the tent
the servants of the khan fled the barriers were torn up and trampled
under foot even the ropes of the tent broke and the cloth covering
very nearly fell on our heads the tents were crowded immediately and
all was in darkness the governor and six of his suite seated
themselves the others stood at arms the visit was of short duration
the governor took refuge in repeating his rosary with great fervour
and in saying to me in agitated tones 'you are welcome you are
welcome' then on the pretext that the crowd inconvenienced me he
retired"

the account is amusing but are all its details accurate? that
however is of little moment on the 31st december the embassy passed
the indus and entered a country cultivated with a care and method
unlike anything to be seen in hindustan the natives of this country
had never heard of the english and took them for moguls afghans or
hindus the strangest reports were current among these lovers of the
marvellous

it was necessary to remain a month at déra to await the arrival of a
"mehnandar" a functionary whose duty it was to introduce ambassadors
two persons attached to the embassy availed themselves of that
opportunity to ascend the peak of tukhte soleiman or the crown of
solomon upon which according to the legend the ark of noah rested
after the deluge

the departure from déra took place upon the 7th of february and after
travelling through delightful countries the embassy arrived at
peshawur the king had come to meet them for peshawur was not the
usual residence of the court the narrative says "upon the day of our
arrival our dinner was furnished from the royal kitchen the dishes
were excellent afterwards we had the meat prepared in our own way but
the king continued to provide us with breakfast dinner and supper
more than sufficient for 2000 persons 200 horses and a large number
of elephants our suite was large and much of this was needed still i
had great trouble at the end of a month in persuading his majesty to
allow some retrenchment of this useless profusion"

as might have been expected the negotiations preceding presentation at
court were long and difficult finally however all was arranged and
the reception was as cordial as diplomatic customs permitted the king
was loaded with diamonds and precious stones he wore a magnificent
crown and the koh-i-noor sparkled upon one of his bracelets this is
the largest diamond in existence a drawing of it may be seen in
tavernier's travels[1]

[footnote 1 the koh-i-noor is now in the possession of the queen of
england]

elphinstone after describing the ceremonies says "i must admit that
if certain things especially the extraordinary richness of the royal
costume excited my astonishment there was also much that fell below
my expectations taking it as a whole one saw less indication of the
prosperity of a powerful state than symptoms of the decay of a monarchy
which had formerly been flourishing"

the ambassador goes on to speak of the rapacity with which the king's
suite quarrelled about the presents offered by the english and gives
other details which struck him unpleasantly

elphinstone was more agreeably impressed with the king at his second
interview he says "it is difficult to believe that an eastern
monarch can possess such a good manner and so perfectly preserve his
dignity while trying to please"

the plain of peshawur which is surrounded on all but the eastern side
by high mountains is watered by three branches of the cabul river
which meet here and by many smaller rivers hence it is singularly
fertile plums peaches pears quinces pomegranates dates grow in
profusion the population so sparsely sprinkled throughout the arid
countries which the ambassador had come through were collected here
and lieut macartney counted no less than thirty-two villages

at peshawur there are 100000 inhabitants living in brick houses three
stories high various mosques not in any way remarkable for
architecture a fine caravanserai and the fortified castle in which
the king received the embassy are the only buildings of importance
the varieties of races with different costumes present a constantly
changing picture a human kaleidoscope which appears made especially
for the astonishment of a stranger persians afghans kyberis
hazaurehs douranis &c with horses dromedaries and bactrian
camels afford the naturalist much both to observe and to describe
respecting bipeds and quadrupeds but the charm of this town as of
every other throughout india is to be found in its gardens with their
abundant and fragrant flowers especially roses

[illustration afghan costumes (fac-simile of early engraving)]

the king's situation at this time was far from pleasant his brother
whom he had dethroned after a popular insurrection had now taken arms
and just seized cabul a longer stay was impossible for the embassy
they had to return to india by way of attock and the valley of hussoun
abdoul which is celebrated for its beauty there elphinstone was to
await the result of the struggle between the brothers which would
decide the fate of the throne of cabul but he had received letters of
recall moreover fate was against soojah who after being completely
worsted had been forced to seek safety in flight

the embassy proceeded on its way and crossed the country of the
sikhs a rude mountain race half-naked and semi-barbarous

"the sikhs who a few years later were to make themselves terribly
famous" says elphinstone "are tall thin men and very strong their
garments consist of trousers which reach only half way down the thigh
they wear cloaks of skins which hang negligently from the shoulder
their turbans are not large but are very high and flattened in front
no scissors ever touch either hair or beard their arms are bows and
arrows or muskets men of rank have very handsome bows and never pay a
visit without being armed with them almost the whole punjab belongs to
runjeet sing who in 1805 was only one among many chiefs in the
country at the time of our expedition he had acquired the sovereignty
of the whole country occupied by the sikhs and had taken the title of
king"

no incident of any moment marked the return of the embassy to delhi in
addition to the narrative of events which had taken place before their
eyes its members brought back invaluable documents concerning the
geography of afghanistan and cabulistan the climate animals and
vegetable and mineral productions of that vast country

elphinstone devotes several chapters of his narrative to the origin
history government legislation condition of the women language and
commerce of these countries facts that were largely appropriated by
the best informed newspapers when the recent english expedition to
afghanistan was undertaken

his work ends with an exhaustive treatise upon the tribes who form the
population of afghanistan and a summary of invaluable information
respecting the neighbouring countries

elphinstone's narrative is curious interesting and valuable for many
reasons and may be consulted in our own day with advantage

[illustration persian costumes (fac-simile of early engraving)]

the zeal of the east india company was indefatigable one expedition
had no sooner returned than another was started with different
instructions it was highly important to be thoroughly au fait of the
ever-changing asiatic policy and to prevent coalition between the
various native tribes against the conquerors of the soil in 1812 a
new idea and a more peaceful one gave rise to the journey of
moorcroft and captain hearsay to lake manasarowar in the province of
the un-dés which is a portion of little thibet

this time the object was to bring back a flock of cashmere goats whose
long silk hair is used in the manufacture of the world-famed shawls in
addition it was proposed to disprove the assertion of the hindus that
the source of the ganges is beyond the himalayas in lake manasarowar
a difficult and perilous task it was first of all necessary to
penetrate into nepaul whilst the government of that country made such
an attempt very difficult and thence to enter a region from which the
natives of nepaul are excluded and with still greater reason the
english

the explorers disguised themselves as hindu pilgrims their suite
consisted of twenty-five persons one of whom pledged himself to walk
in strides of four feet this was certainly a rough method of
ascertaining the distance traversed

messrs moorcroft and hearsay passed through bareilly and followed
webb's route as far as djosimath which place they left on the 26th of
may 1812 they soon had to cross the last chain of the himalayas with
increasing difficulties owing to the rarity of the villages which
caused a scarcity of provisions and service and the bad roads at so
great a height above the level of the sea

nevertheless they saw daba where there is an important lamasery
gortope maisar and a quarter of a mile from tirthapuri curious hot
springs

the original narrative which appeared in the "annales des voyages"
speaks of this water as flowing from two openings six inches in
diameter in a calcareous plain some three miles in extent and which is
raised in almost every direction from ten to twelve feet above the
surrounding country it is formed of the earthy deposits left by the
water in cooling the water rises four inches above the level of the
plain it is clear and so warm that one cannot keep a hand in it
longer than a few minutes it is surrounded by a thick cloud of smoke
the water flowing over a horizontal surface hollows out basins of
various shapes which as they receive the earthy deposits contract
again when they are filled up the flow of the water again hollows out
a new reservoir which in its turn becomes full flowing thus from one
to the other it finally reaches the plain below the deposit left by
the water is as white as the purest stucco close to the opening a
little further it becomes pale yellow and further still
saffron-coloured at the other spring it is first rose-coloured and
then dark red these different colours are to be found in the
calcareous plain and are no doubt the work of centuries

tirthapuri the residence of a lama is of great antiquity and is a
favourite rendezvous for the faithful as a wall more than 400 feet
long and four wide formed of stones upon which prayers are inscribed
sufficiently testifies

upon the 1st of august the travellers left this place hoping to reach
lake manasarowar and leaving on the right lake rawan-rhad which is
supposed to be the source of the largest branch of the sutlej

lake manasarowar lies at the foot of immense sloping prairies to the
south of the gigantic mountains this is the most venerated of all the
sacred places of the hindus which is no doubt owing to its distance
from hindustan the dangers and fatigues of the journey and the
necessity of pilgrims providing themselves with money and provisions
hindu geographers regard this lake as the source of the ganges the
sutlej and the kali rivers moorcroft had no doubt as to the error of
this assertion as regards the ganges desiring to ascertain the truth
as to the other rivers he explored the steep banks of the lake and
found a number of streams which flowed into it but none flowing out of
it it is possible that before the earthquake which destroyed srinagar
the lake had an outlet but moorcroft found no trace of it the lake is
situated between the himalayas and the cailas chain and is of
irregular oblong shape five leagues long by four wide

the end of the expedition was attained moorcroft and hearsay returned
towards india passed by kangri and saw rawan-rhad but moorcroft was
too weak and could not continue the tour he regained tirthapuri and
daba and suffered a great deal in crossing the ghat which separates
hindustan from thibet

the narrative describes the wind which comes from the snow-covered
mountains of bhutan as cold and piercing and the ascent of the
mountain as long and painful its descent slippery and steep making
precautions necessary "we suffered greatly" says the writer "our
goats escaped by the negligence of their drivers and climbed up to the
edge of a precipice some hundred feet in height a mountaineer
disturbing them from their perilous position they began the descent
running down a very steep incline the hinder ones kicked up the
stones which falling with violence threatened to strike the
foremost it was curious to note how cleverly they managed to run and
avoid the falling stones"

very soon the gorkhalis who had hitherto been content to place
obstacles in the way of the travellers approached them with intent to
stop them for some time the firmness displayed by the english kept
them at bay but at last gaining courage from their numbers they
began an attack

"twenty men" says moorcroft "threw themselves upon me one seized me
by my neck and pressing his knees against me tried to strangle me by
tightening my cravat another passed a cord round my legs and pulled me
from behind i was on the point of fainting my gun upon which i was
leaning escaped my hold i fell they dragged me up by my feet until i
was nearly garotted when at last i rose nothing could exceed the
expression of fierce delight on the faces of my conquerors fearing
that i should attempt to escape two soldiers held me by a rope and
gave me a blow from time to time no doubt to remind me of my position
mr hearsay had not supposed that he should be attacked so soon he was
rinsing out his mouth when the hubbub began and did not hear my cries
for help our men could not find the few arms we possessed some
escaped i know not how the others were seized amongst them mr
hearsay he was not bound as i was they contented themselves with
holding his arms"

[illustration "two soldiers held me"]

the chief of this band of savages informed the two englishmen that they
had been recognized and were arrested for having travelled in the
country in the disguise of hindu pilgrims a fakir whom moorcroft had
engaged as a goat-herd succeeded in escaping and took two letters to
the english authorities aid was sent and on the 1st of november the
prisoners were released not only were excuses offered for their
treatment but what had been taken from them was returned and the
rajah of nepaul gave them permission to leave his dominions all's well
that ends well

to complete our sketch we must give an account of mr fraser's
expedition to the himalayas and hodgson's exploration to the source of
the ganges in 1817

captain webb as we have seen had traced the course of that river past
the valley of dhoun to cadjani near reital leaving this spot upon
the 28th of may 1817 captain hodgson reached the source of the ganges
in three days and proceeded to gangautri he found that the river
issues from a low arch in the midst of an enormous mass of frozen snow
more than 300 feet high the stream was already of considerable size
being no less than twenty-seven feet wide and eighteen inches deep in
all probability the ganges first emerged into the light at this spot

captain hodgson wished to solve various questions for example what
was the length of the river under the frozen snow? is it the product of
the melting of these snows? or did it spring from the ground? but
wishing to explore further upwards than his guides advised the
traveller sank into the snow up to his neck and had to retrace his
steps with great difficulty the spot from which the ganges issues is
situated 12914 feet above the level of the sea in the himalayas

hodgson also explored the source of the jumna at djemautri the mass of
snow from which the river makes its escape is no less than 180 feet
wide and more than forty feet deep between two perpendicular walls of
granite this source is situated on the south-east slope of the
himalayas

the extension of the british power in india was necessarily attended by
considerable danger the various native states many of which could
boast of a glorious past had only yielded in obedience to the
well-known political principle "divide and govern" ascribed to
machiavelli but the day might come when they would merge their
rivalries and enmities to make common cause against the invader

this was anything but a cheering prospect for the company whose policy
it was to maintain the system that had hitherto worked so well certain
neighbouring states still powerful enough to regard the growth of the
british power with jealousy might serve as harbours of refuge to the
discontented and become the centres of dangerous intrigues of all
these neighbouring states that which demanded the strictest
surveillance was persia not only on account of its contiguity to
russia but because napoleon was known to have designs in connexion
with it which nothing but his european wars prevented him from putting
into execution

in february 1807 general gardane who had gained his promotion in the
wars of the republic and had distinguished himself at austerlitz
jena and eylau was appointed minister plenipotentiary to persia with
instructions to ally himself with shah feth-ali against england and
russia the selection was fortunate for the grandfather of general
gardane had held a similar post at the court of the shah gardane
crossed hungary and reached constantinople and asia minor but when he
entered persia abbas mirza had succeeded his father feth-ali

the new shah received the french ambassador with respect loaded him
with presents and granted certain privileges to catholics and french
merchants these were however the only results of the mission which
was thwarted by the english general malcolm whose influence was then
paramount and gardane disheartened by finding all his efforts
frustrated and recognizing that success was hopeless returned to
france the following year

his brother ange de gardane who had acted as his secretary published
a brief narrative of the journey containing several curious details
respecting the antiquities of persia which have been however largely
supplemented by works brought out by englishmen

the french consul adrien dupré attached to gardane's mission also
published a work under the title of "voyage en perse fait dans les
années 1807 à 1809 en traversant l'anatolie la mésopotamie depuis
constantinople jusqu'à l'extremité du golfe persique et de là à irwan
suivi de détails sur les moeurs les usages et le commerce des persans
sur la cour de téhéran et d'une notice des tribus de la perse" the
book bears out the assertions of its title and is a valuable
contribution to the geography and ethnography of persia

the english who made a much longer stay in the country than the
french were better able to collect the abundant materials at hand and
to make a judicious selection from them

two works were long held to be the chief authorities on the subject
one of these was by james morier who availed himself of the leisure he
enjoyed as secretary to the embassy to acquaint himself with every
detail of persian manners and on his return to england published
several oriental romances which obtained a signal success owing to
the variety and novelty of the scenes described and the fidelity to
nature of every feature however minute

the second of the two volumes alluded to above was the large quarto
work by john macdonald kinneir on the geography of persia this book
which made its mark and left far behind it everything previously
published on the subject not only gives as its title implies very
valuable information on the boundaries of the country its mountains
rivers and climate but also contains interesting and trustworthy
details respecting its government constitution army commerce
animal vegetable and mineral productions population and revenue

after giving an exhaustive and brilliant picture of the material and
moral resources of the persian empire kinneir goes on to describe its
different provinces quoting from the mass of valuable documents
accumulated by himself thus making his work the most complete and
impartial yet issued

kinneir passed the years 1808 to 1814 in travelling about asia minor
armenia and kurdistan and the different posts held by him during that
period were such as to give him exceptional opportunities for making
observations and comparing their results in his several capacities as
captain in the service of the company political agent to the nawab of
the carnatic or private traveller his critical acumen was never at
fault and his wide knowledge of oriental character and oriental
manners enabled him to recognize the true significance of many an
event and many a revolution which would have escaped the notice of less
experienced observers

at the same time william price also a captain in the east india
company's service who had been attached as interpreter and secretary
to sir william gore ouseley's embassy to persia in 1810 devoted
himself to the study of the cuneiform character many had previously
attempted to decipher it with results as various as they were
ridiculous and like those of his predecessors and contemporaries
price's opinions were mere guess-work but he succeeded in interesting
a certain class of students in this obscure branch of research and may
be said to have perpetuated the theories of niebuhr and other
orientalists

to price we owe an account of the journey of the english embassy to the
persian court after which he published two essays on the antiquities
of persepolis and babylon

mr ouseley who had accompanied his brother sir william as secretary
availed himself of his sojourn at the court of teheran to study
persian his works do not however bear upon geography or political
economy but treat only of inscriptions coins manuscripts and
literature in a word of everything connected with the intellectual
and material history of the country to him we owe an edition of
firdusi and many other volumes which came out at just the right time
to supplement the knowledge already acquired of the country of the
shah

another semi-asiatic semi-european country was also now becoming known
this was the mountainous district of the caucasus as early as the
second half of the eighteenth century john anthony guldenstædt a
russian doctor had visited astrakhan and kisliar on the terek at the
most remote boundary of the russian possessions entered georgia where
the czar heraclius received him with great respect and penetrated to
tiflis and the country of the truchmenes finally arriving at imeritia
the next year 1773 he visited the great kabardia the oriental
kumania examined the ruins of madjary visited tscherkask and asov
discovered the mouth of the don and was about to extend his researches
to the crimea when he was recalled to st petersburg

guldenstædt's travels have not been translated into french their
author's career was cut short by death before he had completed their
revision for the press and they were edited at st petersburg by henry
julius von klaproth a young prussian who afterwards explored the same
countries

klaproth who was born at berlin on the 11th october 1783 gave proof
at a very early age of a special aptitude for the study of oriental
languages at fifteen years old he taught himself chinese and he had
scarcely finished his studies at the universities of halle and dresden
when he began the publication of his "asiatic magazine" invited to
russia by count potoki he was at once named professor of oriental
languages at the academy of st petersburg

klaproth did not belong to the worthy race of book-worms who shut
themselves up in their own studies he took a wider view of the nature
of true knowledge feeling that the surest way to attain a thorough
acquaintance with the languages of asia and of oriental manners and
customs was to study them on the spot he therefore asked permission to
accompany the ambassador golowkin who was going to china overland and
the necessary credentials obtained he started alone for siberia
making acquaintance with the samoyèdes the tongouses bashkirs
yakontes kirghizes and other of the finnic and tartar hordes which
frequent these vast steppes finally arriving at yakutsk where he was
soon joined by golowkin after a halt at kiakta the embassy crossed
the chinese frontier on the 1st january 1806

the viceroy of mongolia however insisted upon the observance by the
ambassador of certain ceremonies which were considered by the latter
degrading to his dignity and neither being disposed to yield golowkin
set out with his suite to return to st petersburg klaproth not
caring to retrace his steps preferred to visit hordes still unknown to
him and he therefore crossed the southern districts of siberia and
collected during a journey extending over twenty months a large number
of chinese mandchoorian thibetan and mongolian books which were of
service to him in his great work "asia polyglotta"

on his return to st petersburg he was invested with all the honours of
the academy and a little later at the suggestion of count potoki he
was appointed to the command of an historical archæological and
geographical expedition to the caucasus klaproth now passed a whole
year in journeys often full of peril amongst thievish tribes through
rugged districts and penetrated to the country traversed by
guldenstædt at the end of the previous century

klaproth's description of tiflis is curious as compared with that of
contemporary authors "tiflis" he says "so called on account of its
mineral springs is divided into three parts tiflis properly so
called or the ancient town kala or the citadel and the suburb of
issni this town is built on the kur and the greater part of its outer
walls is now in ruins its streets are so narrow that 'arbas' as the
lofty carriages so characteristic of oriental places are called could
only pass with difficulty down the widest whilst in the others a
horseman would barely find room to ride the houses badly built of
flints and bricks cemented with mud never last longer than about
fifteen years" in klaproth's time tiflis boasted of two markets but
everything was extremely dear shawls and silk scarves manufactured in
the neighbouring asiatic countries bringing higher prices than in st
petersburg

tiflis must not be dismissed without a few words concerning its hot
springs klaproth tells us that the famous hot baths were formerly
magnificent but they are falling into ruins although some few remain
the floors of which are cased in marble the waters contain very little
sulphur and are most salutary in their effects the natives especially
the women use them to excess the latter remaining in them several
days and even taking their meals in the bath

the chief food of the people of tiflis at least in the mountainous
districts is the bhouri a kind of hard bread with a very disagreeable
taste prepared in a way repugnant to our sybarite notions

when the dough is sufficiently kneaded a bright clear fire of dry wood
is made in earthen vessels four feet high by two wide which are sunk
in the ground when the fire is burning fiercely the georgians shake
into it the vermin by which their shirts and red-silk breeches are
infested not until this ceremony has been performed do they throw the
dough which is divided into pieces of the size of two clenched fists
into the pots the dough once in the vessels are covered with lids
over which rags are placed to make sure of all the heat being kept in
and the bread being thoroughly baked it is however always badly
done and very difficult of digestion

having thus assisted at the preparation of the food of the poor
mountaineer let us join klaproth at the table of a prince a long
striped cloth about a yard and a half wide and very dirty was spread
for his party on this was placed for each guest an oval-shaped wheaten
cake three spans long by two wide and scarcely as thick as a finger
a number of little brass bowls filled with mutton and boiled rice
roast fowls and cheese cut in slices were then brought in as it was
a fast day smoked salmon with uncooked green vegetables was served to
the prince and his subjects spoons forks and knives are unknown in
georgia soup is eaten from the bowl meat is taken in the hands and
torn with the fingers into pieces the size of a mouthful to throw a
tid-bit to another guest is a mark of great friendship the repast
over grapes and dried fruits are eaten during the meal a good red
native wine called traktir by the tartars and ghwino by the
georgians is very freely circulated it is drunk from flat silver
bowls greatly resembling saucers

klaproth's account of the different incidents of his journey is no less
interesting and vivid than this description of the manners of the
people take for instance what he says of his trip to the sources of
the terek the site of which had been pretty accurately indicated by
guldenstædt although he had not visited them

"i left the village of utzfars-kan on the 17th march on a bright but
cold morning fifteen ossetes accompanied me after half an hour's
march we began to climb the steep and rugged ascent leading to the
junction of the utzfars-don with the terek this was succeeded by a
still worse road running for a league alongside of the river which is
scarcely ten paces wide here although it was then swollen by the
melting of the snow this part of the river banks is inhabited we
continued to ascend and reached the foot of the khoki also called
istir-khoki finally arriving at a spot where an accumulation of large
stones in the bed of the river rendered it possible to cross over to
the village of tsiwratté-kan where we breakfasted here the small
streams forming the terek meet i was so glad to have reached the end
of my journey that i poured a glass of hungarian wine into the river
and made a second libation to the genius of the mountain in which the
terek rises the ossetes who thought i was performing a religious
ceremony observed me gravely on the smooth sides of an enormous block
of schist i engraved in red the date of my journey together with my
name and those of my companions after which i climbed up to the
village of ressi"

[illustration "fifteen ossetes accompanied me"]

after this account of his journey from which we might multiply
extracts klaproth sums up all the information he has collected on the
tribes of the caucasus dwelling specially on the marked resemblances
which exist between the different georgian dialects and those of the
finns and lapps this was a new and useful suggestion

speaking of the lesghians who occupy the eastern caucasus known as
daghestan or lezghistan klaproth says their name is a misnomer just
as scythian or tartar was used to indicate the natives of northern
asia adding that they do not form one nation as is proved by the
number of dialects in use which however would seem to have been
derived from a common source though time has greatly modified them
this is a contradiction in terms implying either that the lesghians
speaking one language form one nation or that forming one nation the
lesghians speak various dialects derived from the same source

according to klaproth lesghian words have a considerable affinity with
the other languages of the caucasus and with those of western asia
especially the dialects of the samoyedes and siberian finns

west and north-west of the lesghians dwell the metzdjeghis or
tchetchentses who are probably the most ancient inhabitants of the
caucasus this is not however the opinion of pallas who looks upon
them as a separate tribe of the alain family the tchetchentse language
greatly resembles the samoyede and other siberian dialects as well as
those of the slavs

the tcherkesses or circassians are the sykhes of the greeks they
formerly inhabited the eastern caucasus and the crimea their language
differs much from other caucasian idioms although the tcherkesses
proceed with the wogouls and the ostiakes we have just seen that the
lesghian and tchetchentse dialects resemble the siberian from one
common stock which at some remote date separated into several
branches of which the huns probably formed one the tcherkesse dialect
is one of the most difficult to pronounce some of the consonants being
produced in a manner so loud and guttural that no european has yet been
able to acquire it

in the caucasus also dwell the abazes who have never left the shores
of the black sea where they have been settled from time
immemorial and the ossetes or as who belong to the indo-germanic
stock they call their country ironistan and themselves the irons
klaproth takes them to be sarmatic medes not only on account of their
name which resembles iran but because of the structure of their
language which proves more satisfactorily than historical documents
and in a most conclusive manner that they spring from the same stock
as the medes and persians this opinion however appears to us mere
conjecture as in the time of klaproth the interpretation of cuneiform
inscriptions had not been accomplished and too little was known of the
language of the medes for any one to judge of its resemblance to the
ossete idiom

"however" continues klaproth "after meeting again the sarmatic medes
of the ancients in this people it is still more surprising also to
recognize the alains who occupied the districts north of the
caucasus"

he adds "it follows from all we have said that the ossetes who call
themselves irons are the medes who assumed the name of irans and
whom herodotus styles the arioi they are moreover the sarmatic medes
of the ancients and belong to the median colony founded in the
caucasus by the scythians they are the as or alains of the middle
ages and lastly they are the iasses of russian chronicles from whom
some of the caucasus range took their name of the iassic mountains"
this is not the place to discuss identifications belonging to the realm
of criticism we will content ourselves with adding to these remarks of
klaproth on the ossete language that its pronunciation resembles that
of the low-german and slavonic dialects

the georgians differ essentially from the neighbouring nations alike
in their language and in their physical and moral qualities they are
divided into four principal tribes the karthalinians mingrelians and
shvans (or swanians) inhabiting the southern range of the caucasus
and the lazes a wild robber tribe

as we have seen the facts collected by klaproth are very curious and
throw an unexpected light on the migration of ancient races the
penetration and sagacity of the traveller were marvellous and his
memory was extraordinary the scholar of berlin rendered signal
services to the science of philology it is to be regretted that his
qualities as a man his principles and his temper were not on a level
with his knowledge and acumen as a professor

we must now leave the old world for the new and give an account of the
explorations of the young republic of the united states so soon as the
federal government was free from the anxieties of war and its position
was alike established and recognized public attention was directed to
the "fur country" which had in turn attracted the english the
spanish and the french nootka sound and the neighbouring coasts
discovered by the great cook and the talented quadra vancouver and
marchand were american moreover the monroe doctrine destined later
to excite so much discussion already existed in embryo in the minds of
the statesmen of the day

in accordance with an act of congress captain merryweather lewis and
lieutenant william clarke were commissioned to trace the missouri
from its junction with the mississippi to its source and to cross the
rocky mountains by the easiest and shortest route thus opening up
communication between the gulf of mexico and the pacific ocean the
officers were also to trade with any indian tribes they might meet

the expedition was composed of regular troops and volunteers numbering
altogether including the leaders forty-three men one boat and two
canoes completed the equipment

on the 14th may 1804 the americans left wood river which flows into
the mississippi and embarked on the missouri from what cass had said
in his journal the explorers expected to have to contend with natural
dangers of a very formidable description and also to fight their way
amongst natives of gigantic stature whose hostility to the white man
was invincible

during the first days of this long canoe voyage only to be compared to
those of orellana and condamine on the amazon the americans were
fortunate enough to meet with some sioux indians an old frenchman a
canadian coureur des bois or trapper who spoke the languages of
most of the missouri tribes and consented to accompany the expedition
as interpreter

they passed the mouths of the osage kansas platte or nebraska and
white river all tributaries of the missouri successively and met
various parties of osage and sioux or maha indians who all appeared
to be in a state of utter degradation one tribe of sioux had suffered
so much from smallpox that the male survivors in a fit of rage and
misery had killed the women and children spared by the terrible
malady and fled from the infected neighbourhood

a little farther north dwelt the ricaris or recs at first supposed to
be the cleanest most polite and most industrious of the tribes the
expedition met with but a few thefts soon modified that favourable
judgment it is curious that these people do not depend entirely on
hunting but cultivate corn peas and tobacco

this is not however the case with the mandans who are a more robust
race a custom obtains among them also characteristic of
polynesia they do not bury their dead but expose them on a scaffold

clarke's narrative gives us a few details relating to this strange
tribe the mandans look upon the supreme being only as an embodiment of
the power of healing as a result they worship two gods whom they call
the great medicine or the physician and the great spirit it would
seem that life is so precious to them that they are impelled to worship
all that can prolong it

their origin is strange they originally lived in a large subterranean
village hollowed out under the ground on the borders of a lake a vine
however struck its roots so deeply in the earth as to reach their
habitations and some of them ascended to the surface by the aid of
this impromptu ladder the descriptions given by them on their return
of the vast hunting-grounds rich in game and fruit which they had
seen led the rest of the tribe to resolve to reach so favoured a land
half of them had gained the surface when the vine bending beneath the
weight of a fat woman gave way and rendered the ascent of the rest
impossible after death the mandans expect to return to their
subterranean home but only those who die with a clear conscience can
reach it the guilty will be flung into a lake

the explorers took up their quarters for the winter amongst the
mandans on the 1st of november they built huts as comfortable as
possible with the materials at their command and in spite of the
extreme cold gave themselves up to the pleasures of hunting which
soon became a positive necessity of their existence

when the ice should break up on the missouri the explorers hoped to
continue their voyage but on their sending the boat down to st louis
laden with the skins and furs already obtained only thirty men were
found willing to carry the expedition through to the end

the travellers soon passed the mouth of the yellowstone river with a
current nearly as strong as that of the missouri flowing through
districts abounding in game

cruel was their perplexity when they arrived at a fork where the
missouri divided into two rivers of nearly equal volume for which was
the main stream? captain lewis with a party of scouts ascended the
southern branch and soon came in sight of the rocky mountains
completely covered with snow guided to the spot by a terrific uproar
he beheld the missouri fling itself in one broad sheet of water over a
rocky precipice beyond which it formed a broken series of rapids
extending for several miles

[illustration "he beheld the missouri"]

the detachment now followed this branch which led them into the heart
of the mountains and for three or four miles dashed along between two
perpendicular walls of rock finally dividing itself into three parts
to which were given the names of jefferson madison and galatin after
celebrated american statesmen

the last heights were soon crossed and then the expedition descended
the slopes overlooking the pacific the americans had brought with them
a soshone woman who had been protected as a girl by the indians of the
east and not only did she serve the explorers faithfully as an
interpreter but also through her recognition of a brother in the
chief of a tribe disposed to be hostile she from that moment secured
cordial treatment for the white men unfortunately the country was
poor the people living entirely on wild berries bark and the little
game they were able to obtain

the americans little accustomed to this frugal fare had to eke it out
by eating their horses which had grown very thin and buying all the
dogs the natives would consent to sell hence they obtained the
nickname of dog-eaters

as the temperature became milder so did the character of the natives
whilst food grew more abundant and as they came down the oregon also
known as the columbia the salmon formed a seasonable addition to the
bill of fare when the columbia which is dangerous for navigation
approaches the sea it forms a vast estuary where the waves from the
offing meet the current of the river the americans more than once
incurred considerable risk of being swallowed up with their frail
canoe before they reached the shores of the ocean

glad to have accomplished the aim of their expedition the explorers
wintered at the mouth of the river and when the fine weather set in
they made their way back to st louis arriving there in may 1806
after an absence of two years four months and ten days they had in
that time according to their own estimate traversed less than 1378
leagues

the impulse was now given and reconnoitring expeditions in the
interior of the new continent rapidly succeeded each other assuming a
little later a scientific character which gives them a position of
their own in the history of discovery

a few years later one of the greatest colonizers of whom england can
boast sir stamford raffles organizer of the expedition which took
possession of the dutch colonies was appointed military governor of
java during an administration extending over five years raffles
brought about numerous reforms and abolished slavery absorbing as was
this work however it did not prevent him from publishing two huge
quarto volumes which are as interesting as they are curious they
contain in addition to the history of java a vast number of details
about the natives of the interior until then little known together
with much circumstantial information respecting the geology and natural
history of the country it is no wonder therefore that in honour of
the man who did so much to make java known the name of rafflesia
should have been given to an immense flower native to it and of which
some specimens measure over three feet in diameter and weigh some ten
pounds

[illustration warrior of java (fac-simile of early engraving)]

raffles was also the first to penetrate to the interior of sumatra of
which the coast only was previously known he visited the districts
occupied by the passoumahs sturdy tillers of the soil the northern
provinces with memang-kabou the celebrated malayan capital and
crossed the southern half of the island from bencoulen to palimbang

sir stamford raffles' fame however rests principally upon his having
drawn the attention of the indian government to the exceptionally
favourable position of singapore which was converted by him into an
open port and grew rapidly into a prosperous settlement

the exploration and colonization of africa

oudney kano sackatoo sultan bello return to europe


the power of napoleon and with it the supremacy of france was
scarcely overthrown the titanic contests to gratify the ambition of
one man at the expense of the intellectual progress of humanity were
scarcely at an end before an honourable rivalry awoke once more and
new scientific and commercial expeditions were set on foot a new era
had commenced

foremost in the ranks of the governments which organized and encouraged
exploring expeditions we find as usual that of england it was in
central africa the vast riches of which had been hinted at in the
accounts given of their travels by hornemann and burckhardt that the
attention of the english was now concentrated

as early as 1816 major peddie starting from senegal reached kakondy
on the river nuñez succumbing however to the fatigue of the journey
and unhealthiness of the climate soon after his arrival in that town
major campbell succeeded him in the command of the expedition and
crossed the lofty mountains of foota-djalion losing in a few days
several men and part of the baggage animals

arrived at the headquarters of the almamy as most of the kings of this
part of africa are called the expedition was detained for a long time
and only obtained permission to depart on payment of a large sum

most disastrous was the return journey for the explorers had not only
to recross the streams they had before forded with such difficulty but
they were subjected to so many insults annoyances and exactions that
to put an end to them campbell was obliged to burn his merchandize
break his guns and sink his powder

against so much fatigue and mortification added to the complete
failure of his expedition major campbell failed to bear up and he
died with several of his officers in the very place where major
peddie had closed his career the few survivors of the party reached
sierra leone after an arduous march

a little later ritchie and captain george francis lyon availing
themselves of the prestige which the siege of algiers had brought to
the british flag and of the cordial relations which the english consul
at tripoli had succeeded in establishing with the principal moorish
authorities determined to follow hornemann's route and penetrate to
the very heart of africa

on the 25th march 1819 the travellers left tripoli with mahommed el
moukni bey of fezzan who is called sultan by his subjects protected
by this escort ritchie and lyon reached murzuk without molestation
but there the former died on the 2nd november worn out by the fatigue
and privations of the journey across the desert lyon who was ill for
some time from the same causes recovered soon enough to foil the
designs of the sultan who counting on his death had already begun to
take possession of his property and also of ritchie's the captain
could not penetrate beyond the southern boundaries of fezzan but he
had time to collect a good deal of valuable information about the chief
towns of that province and the language of its inhabitants to him we
likewise owe the first authentic details of the religion customs
language and extraordinary costumes of the tuarick arabs a wild tribe
inhabiting the great sahara desert

captain lyon's narrative also contains a good deal of interesting
information collected by himself on bornou wadai and the soudan
although he was unable to visit those places in person

the results obtained did not by any means satisfy the english
government which was most eager to open up the riches of the interior
to its merchants consequently the authorities received favourably the
proposals made by dr walter oudney a scotchman whose enthusiasm had
been aroused by the travels of mungo park this dr oudney was a friend
of hugh clapperton a lieutenant in the navy three years his senior
who had distinguished himself in canada and elsewhere but had been
thrown out of employment and reduced to half-pay by the peace of 1815

hearing of oudney's scheme clapperton at once determined to join him
in it and oudney begged the minister to allow him the aid of that
enterprising officer whose special knowledge would be of great
assistance lord bathurst made no objection and the two friends after
receiving minute instructions embarked for tripoli where they
ascertained that major denham was to take the command of their
expedition

denham was born in london on the 31st december 1783 and began life as
an articled pupil to a country lawyer as an attorney's clerk he found
his duties so irksome and so little suited to his daring spirit that
his longing for adventure soon led him to enlist in a regiment bound
for spain until 1815 he remained with the army but after the peace he
employed his leisure in visiting france and italy

denham eager to obtain distinction had chosen the career which would
best enable him to achieve it even at the risk of his life and he now
resolved to become an explorer with him to think was to act he had
asked the minister to commission him to go to timbuctoo by the route
laing afterwards took when he heard of the expedition under clapperton
and oudney and he now begged to be allowed to join them

without any delay denham obtained the necessary equipment and
accompanied by a carpenter named william hillman he embarked for
malta joining his future travelling companions at tripoli on the 21st
november 1821 the english at this time enjoyed very great prestige
not only in the states of barbary on account of the bombardment of
algiers but also because the british consul at tripoli had by his
clever diplomacy established friendly relations with the government to
which he was accredited

this prestige extended beyond the narrow range of the northern states
the nationality of certain travellers the protection accorded by
england to the porte the british victories in india had all been
vaguely rumoured even in the heart of africa and the name of
englishman was familiar without any particular meaning being attached
to it according to the english consul the route from tripoli to
bornou was as safe as that from london to edinburgh this was
therefore the moment to seize opportunities which might not occur
again

the three travellers after a cordial reception from the bey who
placed all his resources at their disposal lost no time in leaving
tripoli and with an escort provided by the moorish governor they
reached murzuk the capital of fezzan on the 8th april 1822 without
difficulty having indeed been received with great enthusiasm in some
of the places through which they passed

at sockna denham tells us the governor came out to meet them
accompanied by the principal inhabitants and hundreds of the country
people who crowded round their horses kissing their hands with every
appearance of cordiality and delight and shouting inglesi
inglesi as the visitors entered the town this welcome was the more
gratifying from the fact that the travellers were the first europeans
to penetrate into africa without wearing a disguise denham adds that
he feels sure their reception would have been far less cordial had they
stooped to play the part of impostors by attempting to pass for
mahommedans

at murzuk they were harassed by annoyances similar to those which had
paralyzed hornemann in their case however circumstances and
character were alike different and without allowing themselves to be
blinded by the compliments paid them by the sultan the english who
were thoroughly in earnest demanded the necessary escort for the
journey to bornou

it was impossible they were told to start before the following
spring on account of the difficulty of collecting a kafila or caravan
and the troops necessary for its escort across the desert

a rich merchant however boo-bucker-boo-khaloum by name a great
friend of the pacha gave the explorers a hint that if he received
certain presents he would smooth away all difficulties he even offered
to escort them himself to bornou for which province he was bound if he
could obtain the necessary permission from the pacha of tripoli

denham believing boo-khaloum to be acting honestly went off to
tripoli to obtain the governor's sanction but on his arrival there he
obtained only evasive answers and finally threatened to embark for
england where he said he would report the obstacles thrown in his way
by the pacha in the carrying out of the objects of the exploring
expedition

these menaces produced no effect and denham actually set sail and was
about to land at marseilles when he received a satisfactory message
from the bey begging him to return and authorizing boo-khaloum to
accompany him and his companions

on the 30th october denham rejoined oudney and clapperton at murzuk
finding them considerably weakened by fever and the effects of the
climate

denham convinced that change of air would restore them to health
persuaded them to start and begin the journey by easy stages he
himself set out on the 20th of november with a caravan of merchants
from mesurata tripoli sockna and murzuk escorted by 210 arab
warriors chosen from the most intelligent and docile of the tribes and
commanded by boo-khaloum

the expedition took the route followed by lyon and soon reached
tegerry which is the most southerly town of fezzan and the last
before the traveller enters the desert of bilma

denham made a sketch of the castle of tegerry from the southern bank of
a salt lake near the town tegerry is entered by a low narrow vaulted
passage leading to a gate in a second rampart the wall is pierced with
apertures which render the entrance by the narrow passage very
difficult above the second gate there is also an aperture through
which darts and fire-brands may be hurled upon the besiegers a mode
of warfare once largely indulged in by the arabs inside the town there
are wells of fairly good water denham is of opinion that tegerry
restored well-garrisoned and provisioned could sustain a long siege
its situation is delightful it is surrounded by date-trees and the
water in the neighbourhood is excellent a chain of low hills stretches
away to the east snipes ducks and wild geese frequent the salt lakes
near the town

leaving tegerry the travellers entered a sandy desert across which it
would not have been easy to find the way had it not been marked out by
the skeletons of men and animals strewn along it especially about the
wells

"one of the skeletons we saw to-day" says denham "still looked quite
fresh the beard was on the chin the features could be recognized 'it
is my slave' exclaimed one of the merchants of the kafila 'i left him
near here four months ago' 'make haste and take him to the market'
cried a facetious slave merchant 'lest some one else should claim
him'"

[illustration a kafila of slaves (fac-simile of early engraving)]

here and there in the desert are oases containing towns of greater or
less importance at which the caravans halt kishi is one of the most
frequented of these places and there the money for the right of
crossing the desert is paid the sultan of kishi the ruler of a good
many of these petty principalities and who takes the title of
commander of the faithful was remarkable for a complete disregard of
cleanliness a peculiarity in which according to denham his court
fully equalled him

this sultan paid boo-khaloum a visit in his tent accompanied by half a
dozen tibboos some of whom were positively hideous their teeth were
of a dark yellow colour the result of chewing tobacco of which they
are so fond that they use it as snuff as well as to chew their noses
looked like little round bits of flesh stuck on to their faces with
nostrils so wide that they could push their fingers right up them
denham's watch compass and musical snuffbox astonished them not a
little he defines these people as brutes with human faces

a little further on the travellers reached the town of kirby situated
in a wâdy near a low range of hills of which the highest are not more
than 400 feet above the sea level and between two salt lakes produced
by the excavations made for building from the centre of these lakes
rise islets consisting of masses of muriate and carbonate of soda the
salt produced by these wâdys or depressions of the soil form an
important article of commerce with bornou and the whole of the soudan

it would be impossible to imagine a more wretched place than kirby its
houses are empty containing not so much as a mat how could it be
otherwise with a place liable to incessant raids from the tuaricks?

the caravan now crossed the tibboo country inhabited by a peaceful
hospitable people to whom as keepers of the wells and reservoirs of
the desert the leaders of caravans pay passage-money the tibboos are
a strong active race and when mounted on their nimble steeds they
display marvellous skill in throwing the lance which the most vigorous
of their warriors can hurl to a distance of 145 yards bilma is their
chief city and the residence of their sultan

on the arrival of the travellers at bilma the sultan escorted by a
number of men and women came out to meet the strangers the women were
much better-looking than those in the smaller towns some of them had
indeed very pleasant faces their white regular teeth contrasting
admirably with their shining black skins and the three "triangular
flaps of hair streaming with oil" coral ornaments in their noses and
large amber necklaces round their throats gave them what denham calls
a "seductive appearance" some of them carried fans made of grass or
hair with which to keep off the flies others were provided with
branches of trees all in fact carried something in their hands
which they waved above their heads their costume consisted of a loose
piece of soudan cloth fastened on the left shoulder and leaving the
right uncovered with a smaller piece wound about the head and falling
on the shoulders or flung back in spite of this paucity of clothing
there was not the least immodesty in their bearing

a mile from bilma and beyond a limpid spring which appears to have
been placed there by nature to afford a supply of water to travellers
lies a desert which it takes no less than ten days to cross this was
probably once a huge salt lake

on the 4th february 1823 the caravan reached lari a town on the
northern boundary of bornou in lat 14 degrees 40 minutes n the
inhabitants astonished at the size of the "kafila" fled in terror at
its approach

"beyond however" says denham "was an object full of interest to us
and the sight of it produced a sensation so gratifying and inspiring
that it would be difficult for language to convey an idea of its force
or pleasure the great lake tchad glowing with the golden rays of the
sun in its strength appeared to be within a mile of the spot on which
we stood"

on leaving lari the appearance of the country changed completely the
sandy desert was succeeded by a clay soil clothed with grass and
dotted with acacias and other trees of various species amongst which
grazed herds of antelopes whilst guinea fowls and the turtle-doves of
barbary flew hither and thither above them towns took the place of
villages with huts of the shape of bells thatched with durra straw

the travellers continued their journey southwards rounding lake tchad
which they had first touched at its most northerly point

the districts bordering on this sheet of water were of a black firm
but muddy soil the waters rise to a considerable height in winter and
sink in proportion in the summer the lake is of fresh water rich in
fish and frequented by hippopotami and aquatic birds near its centre
on the south-east are the islands inhabited by the biddomahs a race
who live by pillaging the people of the mainland

the explorers had sent a messenger to sheikh el khanemy to ask
permission to enter his capital and an envoy speedily arrived to
invite boo-khaloum and his companions to kouka

on their way thither the travellers passed through burwha a fortified
town which had thus far resisted the inroads of the tuaricks and
crossed the yeou a large river in some parts more than 500 feet in
width which rising in the soudan flows into lake tchad

on the southern shores of this river rises a little town of the same
name about half the size of burwha

the caravan soon reached the gates of kouka where after a journey
extending over two months and a half they were received by a body of
cavalry 4000 strong under perfect discipline amongst these troops was
a corps of blacks forming the body-guard of the sheikh whose
equipments resembled those of ancient chivalry

[illustration member of the body-guard of the sheikh of bornou
(fac-simile of early engraving)]

they wore denham tells us suits of chain armour covering the neck and
shoulders these were fastened above the head and fell in two
portions one in front and one behind so as to protect the flanks of
the horse and the thighs of the rider a sort of casque or iron coif
kept in its place by red white or yellow turbans tied under the chin
completed the costume the horses' heads were also guarded by iron
plates their saddles were small and light and their steel stirrups
held only the point of the feet which were clad in leather shoes
ornamented with crocodile skin the horsemen managed their steeds
admirably as advancing at full gallop brandishing their spears they
wheeled right and left of their guests shouting "barca barca"
(blessing blessing)

surrounded by this brilliant and fantastic escort the english and
arabs entered the town where a similar military display had been
prepared in their honour

they were presently admitted to the presence of sheikh el-khanemy who
appeared to be about forty-five years old and whose face was
prepossessing with a happy intelligent and benevolent expression

the english presented the letters of the pacha and when the sheikh had
read them he asked denham what had brought him and his companions to
bornou

"we came merely to see the country" replied denham "to study the
character of its people its scenery and its productions"

"you are welcome" was the reply "it will be a pleasure to me to show
you everything i have ordered huts to be built for you in the town
you may go and see them accompanied by one of my people and when you
are recovered from the fatigue of your long journey i shall be happy
to see you"

[illustration reception of the mission (fac-simile of early
engraving)]

the travellers soon afterwards obtained permission to make collections
of such animals and plants as appeared to them curious and to make
notes of all their observations they were thus enabled to collect a
good deal of information about the towns near kouka

kouka then the capital of bornou boasted of a market for the sale of
slaves sheep oxen cheese rice earth-nuts beans indigo and other
productions of the country there 100000 people might sometimes be
seen haggling about the price of fish poultry meat the last sold
both raw and cooked or that of brass copper amber and coral linen
was so cheap in these parts that some of the men wore shirts and
trousers made of it

beggars have a peculiar mode of exciting compassion they station
themselves at the entrance to the market and holding up the rags of
an old pair of trousers they whine out to the passers-by "see i have
no pantaloons" the novelty of this mode of proceeding and the request
for a garment which seemed to them even more necessary than food made
our travellers laugh heartily until they became accustomed to it

hitherto the english had had nothing to do with any one but the sheikh
who content with wielding all real power left the nominal sovereignty
to the sultan an eccentric monarch who never showed himself except
through the bars of a wicker cage near the gate of his garden as if he
were some rare wild beast curious indeed were some of the customs of
this court not the least so the fancy for obesity no one was
considered elegant unless he had attained to a bulk generally looked
upon as very inconvenient

some exquisites had stomachs so distended and prominent that they
seemed literally to hang over the pommel of the saddle and in addition
to this fashion prescribed a turban of such length and weight that its
wearer had to carry his head on one side

these uncouth peculiarities rivalled those of the turks of a masked
ball and the travellers had often hard work to preserve their gravity
to compensate however for the grotesque solemnity of the various
receptions a new field for observation was open and much valuable
information might now be acquired

denham wished to proceed to the south at once but the sheikh was
unwilling to risk the lives of the travellers entrusted to him by the
bey of tripoli on their entry into bornou the responsibility of
boo-khaloum for their safety was transferred to him

so earnest however were the entreaties of denham that el-khanemy at
last sanctioned his accompanying boo-khaloum in a "ghrazzie" or
plundering expedition against the kaffirs or infidels

the sheikh's army and the arab troops passed in succession yeddie a
large walled city twenty miles from angoumou badagry and several
other towns built on an alluvial soil which has a dark clay-like
appearance

they entered mandara at the frontier town of delow beyond which the
sultan of the province with five hundred horsemen met his guests

denham describes mahommed becker as a man of short stature about fifty
years old wearing a beard painted of a most delicate azure blue the
presentations over the sultan at once turned to denham and asked who
he was whence he came what he wanted and lastly if he were a
mahommedan on boo-khaloum's hesitating to reply the sultan turned
away his head with the words "so the pacha numbers infidels amongst
his friends"

this incident had a very bad effect and denham was not again admitted
to the presence of the sultan

[illustration lancer of the army of the sultan of begharmi
(fac-simile of early engraving)]

the enemies of the pacha of bornou and the sultan of mandara were
called fellatahs their vast settlements extended far beyond timbuctoo
they are a handsome set of men with skins of a dark bronze colour
which shows them to be of a race quite distinct from the negroes they
are professors of mahommedanism and mix but little with the blacks we
shall presently have to speak more particularly of the fellatahs
foulahs or fans as they are called throughout the soudan

south of the town of mora rises a chain of mountains of which the
loftiest peaks are not more than 2500 feet high but which according
to the natives extend for more than "two months' journey"

the most salient point noticed by denham in his description of the
country is a vast and apparently interminable chain of mountains
shutting in the view on every side this though in his opinion
inferior to the alps apennines jura and sierra morena in rugged
magnificence and gigantic grandeur are yet equal to them in
picturesque effect the lofty peaks of valhmy savah djoggiday
munday &c with clustering villages on their stony sides rise on the
east and west while horza exceeding any of them in height and beauty
rises on the south with its ravines and precipices

derkulla one of the chief fellatah towns was reduced to ashes by the
invaders who lost no time in pressing on to musfeia a position which
naturally very strong was further defended by palisades manned by a
numerous body of archers the english traveller had to take part in the
assault the first onslaught of the arabs appeared to carry all before
it the noise of the fire-arms with the reputation for bravery and
cruelty enjoyed by boo-khaloum and his men threw the fellatahs into
momentary confusion and if the men of mandara and bornou had followed
up their advantage and stormed the hill the town would probably have
fallen

the besieged however noticing the hesitation of their assailants in
their turn assumed the defensive and rallying their archers discharged
a shower of poisoned arrows to which many an arab fell a victim and
before which the forces of bornou and mandara gave way

barca the bornou general had three horses killed under him
boo-khaloum and his steed were both wounded and denham was in a
similar plight with the skin of his face grazed by one arrow and two
others lodged in his burnoos

the retreat soon became a rout denham's horse fell under him and the
major had hardly regained his feet when he was surrounded by fellatahs
two fled on the presentation of the englishman's pistols a third
received the charge in his shoulder

denham thought he was safe when his horse fell a second time flinging
his master violently against a tree this time when the major rose he
found himself with neither horse nor weapons and the next moment he
was surrounded by enemies who stripped him and wounded him in both
hands and the right side leaving him half dead at last to fight over
his clothes which seemed to them of great value

availing himself of this lucky quarrel denham slipped under a horse
standing by and disappeared in the thicket naked bleeding wild with
pain he reached the edge of a ravine with a mountain stream flowing
through it his strength was all but gone and he was clutching at a
bough of a tree overhanging the water with a view to dropping himself
into it as the banks were very steep and the branches were actually
bending beneath his weight when from beneath his hand a gigantic
liffa the most venomous kind of serpent in the country rose from its
coil in the very act of striking horror-struck denham let slip the
branch and tumbled headlong into the water but fortunately the shock
revived him he struck out almost unconsciously swam to the opposite
bank and climbing it found himself safe from his pursuers

fortunately the fugitive soon saw a group of horsemen amongst the
trees and in spite of the noise of the pursuit he managed to shout
loud enough to make them hear him they turned out to be barca gana and
boo-khaloum with some arabs mounted on a sorry steed with no other
clothing than an old blanket swarming with vermin denham travelled
thirty-seven miles the pain of his wounds was greatly aggravated by
the heat the thermometer being at 32 degrees

the only results of the expedition which was to have brought in such
quantities of booty and numerous slaves were the deaths of boo-khaloum
and thirty-six of his arabs the wounding of nearly all the rest and
the loss or destruction of all the horses

the eighty miles between mora and kouka were traversed in six days
denham was kindly received in the latter town by the sultan who sent
him a native garment to replace his lost wardrobe the major had hardly
recovered from his wounds and fatigue before he took part in a new
expedition sent to munga a province on the west of bornou by the
sheikh whose authority had never been fully recognized there and
whose claim for tribute had been refused by the inhabitants

[illustration map of denham and clapperton's journey gravé par e
morieu]

denham and oudney left kouka on the 22nd may and crossed the yeou
then nearly dried up but an important stream in the rainy season and
visited birnie with the ruins of the capital of the same name which
was capable of containing two hundred thousand inhabitants the
travellers also passed through the ruins of gambarou with its
magnificent buildings the favourite residence of the former sultan
destroyed by the fellatahs kabshary bassecour bately and many other
towns or villages whose numerous populations submitted without a
struggle to the sultan of bornou

the rainy season was disastrous to the members of the expedition
clapperton fell dangerously ill of fever and oudney whose chest was
delicate even before he left england grew weaker every day denham
alone kept up on the 14th of december when the rainy season was
drawing to a close clapperton and oudney started for kano we shall
presently relate the particulars of this interesting part of their
expedition

seven days later an ensign named toole arrived at kouka after a
journey from tripoli which had occupied only three months and fourteen
days

in february 1824 denham and toole made a trip into luggun on the
south of lake tchad all the districts near the lake and its tributary
the shari are marshy and flooded during the rainy season the
unhealthiness of the climate was fatal to young toole who died at
angala on the 26th of february at the early age of twenty-two
persevering enterprising bright and obliging with plenty of pluck
and prudence toole was a model explorer

luggun was then very little known its capital kernok contained no
less than 15000 inhabitants the people of luggun especially the
women who are very industrious and manufacture the finest linens and
fabrics of the closest texture are handsomer and more intelligent than
those of bornou

the necessary interview with the sultan ended after an exchange of
complimentary speeches and handsome presents in this strange proposal
from his majesty to the travellers "if you have come to buy female
slaves you need not be at the trouble to go further as i will sell
them to you as cheap as possible" denham had great trouble in
convincing the merchant prince that such traffic was not the aim of his
journey but that the love of science alone had brought him to luggun

on the 2nd of march denham returned to kouka and on the 20th of may
he was witness to the arrival of lieutenant tyrwhitt who had come to
take up his residence as consul at the court of bornou bearing costly
presents for the sultan

[illustration portrait of clapperton (fac-simile of early
engraving)]

after a final excursion in the direction of manou the capital of
kanem and a visit to the dogganah who formerly occupied all the
districts about lake fitri the major joined clapperton in his return
journey to tripoli starting on the 16th of april and arriving there
in safety at the close of a long and arduous journey whose
geographical results important in any case had been greatly enhanced
by the labours of clapperton to the adventures and discoveries of the
latter we must now turn clapperton and oudney started for kano a
large fellatah town on the west of lake tchad on the 14th of december
1823 followed the yeou as far as damasak and visited the ruins of
birnie and those of bera on the shores of a lake formed by the
overflowing of the yeou dogamou and bekidarfi all towns of houssa
the people of this province who were very numerous before the invasion
of the fellatahs are armed with bows and arrows and trade in tobacco
nuts gouro antimony tanned hares' skins and cotton stuffs in the
piece and made into clothes

the caravan soon left the banks of the yeou or gambarou and entered a
wooded country which was evidently under water in the rainy season

the travellers then entered the province of katagoum where the
governor received them with great cordiality assuring them that their
arrival was quite an event to him as it would be to the sultan of the
fellatahs who like himself had never before seen an englishman he
also assured them that they would find all they required in his
district just as at kouka

the only thing which seemed to surprise him much was the fact that his
visitors wanted neither slaves horses nor silver and that the sole
proof of his friendship they required was permission to collect flowers
and plants and to travel in his country

according to clapperton's observations katagoum is situated in lat 12
degrees 17 minutes 11 seconds n and about 12 degrees e long before
the fellatahs were conquered it was on the borders of the province of
bornou it can send into the field 4000 cavalry and 2000 foot
soldiers armed with bows and arrows swords and lances wheat and
oxen with slaves are its chief articles of commerce the citadel is
the strongest the english had seen except that of tripoli entered by
gates which are shut at night it is defended by two parallel walls
and three dry moats one inside one out and the third between the two
walls which are twenty feet high and ten feet wide at the base a
ruined mosque is the only other object of interest in the town which
consists of mud houses and contains some seven or eight hundred
inhabitants

there the english for the first time saw cowries used as money
hitherto native cloth had been the sole medium of exchange

south of katagoum is the yacoba country called mouchy by the
mahommedans according to accounts received by clapperton the people
of yacoba which is shut in by limestone mountains are cannibals the
mahommedans however who have an intense horror of the "kaffirs" give
no other proof of this accusation than the statement that they have
seen human heads and limbs hanging against the walls of the houses

in yacoba rises the yeou a river which dries up completely in the
summer but according to the people who live on its banks rises and
falls regularly every week throughout the rainy season

on the 11th of january the journey was resumed but a halt had to be
made at murmur at noon of the same day as oudney showed signs of such
extreme weakness and exhaustion that clapperton feared he could not
last through another day he had been gradually failing ever since they
left the mountains of obarri in fezzan where he had inflammation of
the throat from sitting in a draught when over-heated

on the 12th of january oudney took a cup of coffee at daybreak and at
his request clapperton changed camels with him he then helped him to
dress and leaning on his servant the doctor left the tent he was
about to attempt to mount his camel when clapperton saw death in his
face he supported him back to the tent where to his intense grief he
expired at once without a groan or any sign of suffering clapperton
lost no time in asking the governor's permission to bury his comrade
and this being obtained he dug a grave for him himself under an old
mimosa-tree near one of the gates of the town after the body had been
washed according to the custom of the country it was wrapped in some
of the turban shawls which were to have served as presents on the
further journey the servants carried it to its last resting-place and
clapperton read the english burial service at the grave when the
ceremony was over he surrounded the modest resting-place with a wall
of earth to keep off beasts of prey and had two sheep killed which
he divided amongst the poor

thus closed the career of the young naturalist and ship's doctor
oudney his terrible malady whose germs he had brought with him from
england had prevented him from rendering so much service to the
expedition as the government had expected from him although he never
spared himself declaring that he felt better on the march than when
resting knowing that his weakened constitution would not admit of any
sustained exertion on his part he would never damp the ardour of his
companions

after this sad event clapperton resumed his journey to kano halting
successively at digou situated in a well-cultivated district rich in
flocks katoungora beyond the province of katagoum zangeia
once judging from its extent and the ruined walls still standing an
important place near the end of the douchi chain of hills girkoua
with a finer market-place than that of tripoli and souchwa surrounded
by an imposing earthwork

kano the chana of edrisi and other arab geographers and the great
emporium of the kingdom of houssa was reached on the 20th january

clapperton tells us that he had hardly entered the gates before his
expectations were disappointed after the brilliant description of the
arabs he had expected to see a town of vast extent the houses were a
quarter of a mile from the walls and stood here and there in little
groups separated by large pools of stagnant water "i might have
dispensed with the care i had bestowed on my dress" (he had donned his
naval uniform) "for the inhabitants absorbed in their own affairs
let me pass without remark and never so much as looked at me"

kano the capital of the province of that name and one of the chief
towns of the soudan is situated in n lat 12 degrees 0 minutes 19
seconds and e long 9 degrees 20 minutes it contains between thirty
and forty thousand inhabitants of whom the greater number are slaves

the market bounded on the east and west by vast reedy swamps is the
haunt of numerous flocks of ducks storks and vultures which act as
scavengers to the town in this market stocked with all the provisions
in use in africa beef mutton goats' and sometimes even camels'
flesh are sold

writing paper of french manufacture scissors and knives antimony
tin red silk copper bracelets glass beads coral amber steel
rings silver ornaments turban shawls cotton cloths calico moorish
habiliments and many other articles are exposed for sale in large
quantities in the market-place of kano

there clapperton bought for three piastres an english cotton umbrella
from ghadames he also visited the slave-market where the unfortunate
human chattels are as carefully examined as volunteers for the navy are
by our own inspectors

the town is very unhealthy the swamps cutting it in two and the holes
produced by the removal of the earth for building produce permanent
malaria

it is the fashion at kano to stain the teeth and limbs with the juice
of a plant called gourgi and with tobacco which produces a bright
red colour gouro nuts are chewed and sometimes even swallowed when
mixed with trona a habit not peculiar to houssa for it extends to
bornou where it is strictly forbidden to women the people of houssa
smoke a native tobacco

on the 23rd of february clapperton started for sackatoo he crossed a
picturesque well-cultivated country whose wooded hills gave it the
appearance of an english park herds of beautiful white or dun-coloured
oxen gave animation to the scenery

the most important places passed en route by clapperton were gadania a
densely populated town the inhabitants of which had been sold as
slaves by the fellatahs doncami zirmia the capital of gambra
kagaria kouari and the wells of kamoun where he met an escort sent
by the sultan

sackatoo was the most thickly populated city that the explorer had seen
in africa its well-built houses form regular streets instead of
clustering in groups as in the other towns of houssa it is surrounded
by a wall between twenty and thirty feet high pierced by twelve gates
which are closed every evening at sunset and it boasts of two mosques
with a market and a large square opposite to the sultan's residence

the inhabitants most of whom are fellatahs own many slaves and the
latter those at least who are not in domestic service work at some
trade for their masters' profit they are weavers masons blacksmiths
shoemakers or husbandmen

to do honour to his host and also to give him an exalted notion of the
power and wealth of england clapperton assumed a dazzling costume when
he paid his first visit to sultan bello he covered his uniform with
gold lace donned white trousers and silk stockings and completed this
holiday attire by a turkish turban and slippers bello received him
seated on a cushion in a thatched hut like an english cottage the
sultan a handsome man about forty-five years old wore a blue cotton
tobe and a white cotton turban one end of which fell over his nose
and mouth in turkish fashion

bello accepted the traveller's presents with childish glee the watch
telescope and thermometer which he naively called a "heat watch"
especially delighted him but he wondered more at his visitor than at
any of his gifts he was unwearied in his questions as to the manners
customs and trade of england and after receiving several replies he
expressed a wish to open commercial relations with that power he would
like an english consul and a doctor to reside in a port he called raka
and finally he requested that certain articles of english manufacture
should be sent to funda a very thriving sea-port of his after a good
many talks on the different religions of europe bello gave back to
clapperton the books journals and clothes which had been taken from
denham at the time of the unfortunate excursion in which boo-khaloum
lost his life

on the 3rd may clapperton took leave of the sultan this time there
was a good deal of delay before he was admitted to an audience bello
was alone and gave the traveller a letter for the king of england
with many expressions of friendship towards the country of his visitor
reiterating his wish to open commercial relations with it and begging
him to let him have a letter to say when the english expedition
promised by clapperton would arrive on the coast of africa

clapperton returned by the route by which he had come arriving on the
8th of july at kouka where he rejoined denham he had brought with him
an arab manuscript containing a geographical and historical picture of
the kingdom of takrour governed by mahommed bello of houssa author of
the manuscript he himself had not only collected much valuable
information on the geology and botany of bornou and houssa but also
drawn up a vocabulary of the languages of begharmi mandara bornou
houssa and timbuctoo

the results of the expedition were therefore considerable the
fellatahs had been heard of for the first time and their identity with
the fans had been ascertained by clapperton in his second journey it
had been proved that these fellatahs had created a vast empire in the
north and west of africa and also that beyond a doubt they did not
belong to the negro race the study of their language and its
resemblance to certain idioms not of african origin will some day
throw a light on the migration of races lastly lake tchad had been
discovered and though not entirely examined the greater part of its
shores had been explored it had been ascertained to have two
tributaries the yeou part of whose course had been traced whilst its
source had been pointed out by the natives and the shari the mouth
and lower portion of which had been carefully examined by denham with
regard to the niger the information collected by clapperton from the
natives was still very contradictory but the balance of evidence was
in favour of its flowing into the gulf of benin however clapperton
intended after a short rest in england to return to africa and
landing on the western coast make his way up the kouara or djoliba as
the natives call the niger to set at rest once for all the dispute as
to whether that river was or was not identical with the nile to
connect his new discoveries with those of denham and lastly to cross
africa taking a diagonal course from tripoli to the gulf of benin

clapperton's second journey arrival at badagry yariba and its capital
katunga boussa attempts to get at the truth about mungo park's
fate "nyffé" yaourie and zegzeg arrival at kano disappointments 
death of clapperton return of lander to the coast tuckey on the
congo bowditch in ashantee mollien at the sources of the senegal and
gambia major grey caillié at timbuctoo laing at the sources of the
niger richard and john lander at the mouth of the niger cailliaud and
letorzec in egypt nubia and the oasis of siwâh


so soon as clapperton arrived in england he submitted to lord bathurst
his scheme for going to kouka viâ the bight of benin in other words
by the shortest way a route not attempted by his predecessors and
ascending the niger from its mouth to timbuctoo

in this expedition three others were associated with clapperton who
took the command these three were a surgeon named dickson pearce a
ship's captain and dr morrison also in the merchant service the
last-named well up in every branch of natural history

on the 26th november 1825 the expedition arrived in the bight of
benin for some reason unexplained dickson had asked permission to
make his way to sockatoo alone and he landed for that purpose at
whydah a portuguese named songa and colombus denham's servant
accompanied him as far as dahomey seventeen days after he left that
town dickson reached char and a little later yaourie beyond which
place he was never traced[1]

[footnote 1 dickson quarrelled with a native chief and was murdered
by his followers see clapperton's "last journey in africa" trans]

the other explorers sailed up the bight of benin and were warned by an
english merchant named houtson not to attempt the ascent of the
quorra as the king of the districts watered by it had conceived an
intense hatred of the english on account of their interference with
the slave-trade the most remunerative branch of his commerce

it would be much better urged houtson to go to badagry no great
distance from sackatoo the chief of which well-disposed as he was to
travellers would doubtless give them an escort as far as the frontiers
of yariba houtson had lived in the country many years and was well
acquainted with the language and habits of its people clapperton
therefore thought it desirable to attach him to the expedition as far
as katunga the capital of yariba

the expedition disembarked at badagry on the 29th november 1825
ascended an arm of the lagos and then for a distance of two miles
the gazie creek which traverses part of dahomey descending the left
bank the explorers began their march into the interior of the country
through districts consisting partly of swamps and partly of yam
plantations everything indicated fertility the negroes were very
averse to work and it would be impossible to relate the numerous
"palavers" and negotiations which had to be gone through and the
exactions which were submitted to before porters could be obtained

the explorers succeeded in spite of these difficulties in reaching
jenneh sixty miles from the coast here clapperton tells us he saw
several looms at work as many as eight or nine in one house a regular
manufactory in fact the people of jenneh also make earthenware but
they prefer that which they get from europe often putting the foreign
produce to uses for which it was never intended

at jenneh the travellers were all attacked with fever the result of
the great heat and the unhealthiness of the climate pearce and
morrison both died on the 27th december the former soon after he left
jenneh with clapperton the latter at that town to which he had
returned to rest

at assondo a town of no less than 10000 inhabitants daffou
containing some 5000 and other places visited by clapperton on his way
through the country he found that an extraordinary rumour had preceded
him to the effect that he had come to restore peace to the districts
distracted by war and to do good to the lands he explored

at tchow the caravan met a messenger with a numerous escort sent by
the king of yariba to meet the explorers and shortly afterwards
katunga was entered this town is built round the base of a rugged
granite mountain it is about three miles in extent and is both framed
in and planted with bushy trees presenting a most picturesque
appearance

[illustration "the caravan met a messenger"]

clapperton remained at katunga from the 24th january to the 7th march
1826 he was entertained there with great hospitality by the sultan
who however refused to give him permission to go to houssa and bornou
by way of nyffé or toppa urging as reasons that nyffé was distracted
by civil war and one of the pretenders to the throne had called in the
aid of the fellatahs it would be more prudent to go through yaourie
whether these excuses were true or not clapperton had to submit

the explorer availed himself of his detention at katunga to make
several interesting observations this town contains no less than seven
markets in which are exposed for sale yams cereals bananas figs
the seeds of gourds hares poultry sheep lambs linen cloth and
various implements of husbandry

the houses of the king and those of his wives are situated in two large
parks the doors and the pillars of the verandahs are adorned with
fairly well executed carvings representing such scenes as a boa
killing an antelope or a pig or a group of warriors and drummers

according to clapperton the people of yariba have fewer of the
characteristics of the negro race than any natives of africa with whom
he was brought in contact their lips are not so thick and their noses
are of a more aquiline shape the men are well made and carry
themselves with an ease which cannot fail to be remarked the women are
less refined-looking than the men the result probably of exposure to
the sun and the fatigue they endure compelled as they are to do all
the work of the fields

soon after leaving katunga clapperton crossed the mousa a tributary
of the quorra and entered kiama one of the halting-places of the
caravans trading between houssa and borghoo and gandja on the
frontiers of ashantee kiama contains no less than 13000 inhabitants
who are considered the greatest thieves in africa to say a man is from
borghoo is to brand him as a blackguard at once

outside kiama the traveller met the houssa caravan some thousands of
men and women oxen asses and horses marching in single file formed
an interminable line presenting a singular and grotesque appearance a
motley assemblage truly naked girls alternating with men bending
beneath their loads or with gandja merchants in the most outlandish
and ridiculous costumes mounted on bony steeds which stumbled at every
step

clapperton now made for boussa on the niger where mungo park was
drowned before reaching it he had to cross the oli a tributary of the
quorra and to pass through wow-wow a district of borghoo the capital
of which also called wow-wow contained some 18000 inhabitants it
was one of the cleanest and best built towns the traveller had entered
since he left badagry the streets are wide and well kept and the
houses are round with conical thatched roofs drunkenness is a
prevalent vice in wow-wow governor priests laymen men and women
indulge to excess in palm wine in rum brought from the coast and in
"bouza" the latter beverage is a mixture made of dhurra honey
cayenne pepper and the root of a coarse grass eaten by cattle with
the addition of a certain quantity of water

clapperton tells us that the people of wow-wow are famous for their
cleanliness they are cheerful benevolent and hospitable no other
people whom he had met with had been so ready to give him information
about their country and more extraordinary still did not meet with a
single beggar the natives say they are not aborigines of borghoo but
that they are descendants of the natives of houssa and nyffé they
speak a yariba dialect but the wow-wow women are pretty which those
of yariba are not the men are muscular and well-made but have a
dissipated look their religion is a lax kind of mahommedanism
tinctured with paganism

since leaving the coast clapperton had met tribes of unconverted
fellatahs speaking the same language and resembling in feature and
complexion others who had adopted mahommedanism a significant fact
which points to their belonging to one race

boussa which the traveller reached at last is not a regular town but
consists of groups of scattered houses on an island of the quorra
situated in lat 10 degrees 14 minutes n and long 6 degrees 11
minutes e the province of which it is the capital is the most densely
populated of borghoo the inhabitants are all pagans even the sultan
although his name is mahommed they live upon monkeys dogs cats
rats beef and mutton

breakfast was served to the sultan whilst he was giving audience to
clapperton whom he invited to join him the meal consisted of a large
water-rat grilled without skinning a dish of fine boiled rice some
dried fish stewed in palm oil fried alligators' eggs washed down with
fresh water from the quorra clapperton took some stewed fish and rice
but was much laughed at because he would eat neither the rat nor the
alligators' eggs

the sultan received him very courteously and told him that the sultan
of yaourie had had boats ready to take him to that town for the last
seven days clapperton replied that as the war had prevented all exit
from bornou and yaourie he should prefer going by way of coulfo and
nyffé "you are right" answered the sultan "you did well to come and
see me and you can take which ever route you prefer"

at a later audience clapperton made inquiries about the englishmen who
had perished in the quorra twenty years before this subject evidently
made the sultan feel very ill at ease and he evaded the questions put
to him by saying he was too young at the time to remember what
happened

clapperton explained that he only wanted to recover their books and
papers and to visit the scene of their death and the sultan in reply
denied having anything belonging to them adding a warning against his
guest's going to the place where they died for it was a "very bad
place"

"but i understood" urged clapperton "that part of the boat they were
in could still be seen"

"no it was a false report" replied the sultan "the boat had long
since been carried down by the stream it was somewhere amongst the
rocks he didn't know where"

to a fresh demand for park's papers and journals the sultan replied
that he had none of them they were in the hands of some learned men
but as clapperton seemed to set such store by them he would have them
looked for thanking him for this promise clapperton begged permission
to question the old men of the place some of whom must have witnessed
the catastrophe no answer whatever was returned to this appeal by
which the sultan was evidently much embarrassed it was useless to
press him further

this was a check to clapperton's further inquiries on every side he
was met with embarrassed silence or such replies as "the affair
happened so long ago i can't remember it" or "i was not witness to
it" the place where the boat had been stopped and its crew drowned was
pointed out to him but even that was done cautiously a few days
later clapperton found out that the former imaun who was a fellatah
had had mungo park's books and papers in his possession unfortunately
however this imaun had long since left boussa finally when at
coulfo the explorer ascertained beyond a doubt that mungo park had
been murdered

before leaving borghoo clapperton recorded his conviction of the
baselessness of the bad reputation of the inhabitants who had been
branded everywhere as thieves and robbers he had completely explored
their country travelled and hunted amongst them alone and never had
the slightest reason to complain

the traveller now endeavoured to reach kano by way of zouari and
zegzeg first crossing the quorra he soon arrived at fabra on the
mayarrow the residence of the queen-mother of nyffé and then went to
visit the king in camp at a short distance from the town this king
clapperton tells us was the most insolent rogue imaginable asking for
everything he saw and quite unabashed by any refusal his ambition and
his calling in of the fellatahs who would throw him over as soon as he
had answered their purpose had been the ruin of his country thanks
indeed to him nearly the whole of the industrial population of nyffé
had been killed sold into slavery or had fled the country

clapperton was detained by illness much longer than he had intended to
remain at coulfo a commercial town on the northern banks of the
mayarrow containing from twelve to fifteen thousand inhabitants
exposed for the last twenty years to the raids of the fellatahs coulfo
had been burnt twice in six years clapperton was witness when there of
the feast of the new moon on that festival every one exchanged visits
the women wear their woolly hair plaited and stained with indigo their
eyebrows are dyed the same colour their eyelids are painted with kohl
their lips are stained yellow their teeth red and their hands and
feet are coloured with henna on the day of the feast of the moon they
don their gayest garments with their glass beads bracelets copper
silver steel or brass they also turn the occasion to account by
drinking as much bouza as the men joining in all their songs and
dances

after passing through katunga clapperton entered the province of
gouari the people of which though conquered with the rest of houssa by
the fellatahs had rebelled against them on the death of bello i and
since then maintained their independence in spite of all the efforts of
their invaders gouari capital of the province of the same name is
situated in lat 10 degrees 54 minutes n and long 8 degrees 1 minute
e

at fatika clapperton entered zegzeg subject to the fellatahs after
which he visited zariyah a singular-looking town laid out with
plantations of millet woods of bushy trees vegetable gardens &c
alternating with marshes lawns and houses the population was very
numerous exceeding even that of kano being estimated indeed at some
forty or fifty thousand nearly all fellatahs

on the 19th september after a long and weary journey clapperton at
last entered kano he at once discovered that he would have been more
welcome if he had come from the east for the war with bornou had
broken off all communication with fezzan and tripoli leaving his
luggage under the care of his servant lander clapperton almost
immediately started in quest of sultan bello who they said was near
sackatoo this was an extremely arduous journey and on it clapperton
lost his camels and horses and was compelled to put up with a
miserable ox to carry part of his baggage he and his servants
dividing the rest amongst them

bello received clapperton kindly and sent him camels and provisions
but as he was then engaged in subjugating the rebellious province of
gouber he could not at once give the explorer the personal audience so
important to the many interests entrusted by the english government to
clapperton

bello advanced to the attack of counia the capital of gouber at the
head of an army of 60000 soldiers nine-tenths of whom were on foot
and wore padded armour the struggle was contemptible in the extreme
and this abortive attempt closed the war clapperton whose health was
completely broken up managed to make his way from sackatoo to magaria
where he saw the sultan

after he had received the presents brought for him bello became less
friendly he presently pretended to have received a letter from sheikh
el khanemy warning him against the traveller whom his correspondent
characterized as a spy and urging him to defy the english who meant
after finding out all about the country to settle in it raise up
sedition and profit by the disturbances they should create to take
possession of houssa as they had done of india

the most patent of all the motives of bello in creating difficulties
for clapperton was his wish to appropriate the presents intended for
the sultan of bornou a pretext being necessary he spread a rumour
that the traveller was taking cannons and ammunition to kouka it was
out of all reason bello should allow a stranger to cross his dominions
with a view to enabling his implacable enemy to make war upon him
finally bello made an effort to induce clapperton to read to him the
letter of lord bathurst to the sultan of bornou

clapperton told him he could take it if he liked but that he would not
give it to him adding that everything was of course possible to him
as he had force on his side but that he would bring dishonour upon
himself by using it "to open the letter myself" said clapperton "is
more than my head is worth" he had come he urged bringing bello a
letter and presents from the king of england relying upon the
confidence inspired by the sultan's letter of the previous year and he
hoped his host would not forfeit that confidence by tampering with
another person's letter

on this the sultan made a gesture of dismissal and clapperton retired

this was not however the last attempt of a similar kind and things
grew much worse later a few days afterwards another messenger was sent
to demand the presents reserved for el khanemy and on clapperton's
refusing to give them up they were taken from him

"i told the gadado" says clapperton "that they were acting like
robbers towards me in defiance of all good faith that no people in
the world would act the same and they had far better have cut my head
off than done such an act but i suppose they would do that also when
they had taken everything from me"

an attempt was now made to obtain his arms and ammunition but this he
resisted sturdily his terrified servants ran away but soon returned
to share the dangers of their master for whom they entertained the
warmest affection

at this critical moment the entries in clapperton's journal ceased he
had now been six months in sackatoo without being able to undertake
any explorations or to bring to a satisfactory conclusion the mission
which had brought him from the coast sick at heart weary and ill he
could take no rest and his illness suddenly increased upon him to an
alarming degree his servant richard lander who had now joined him
tried in vain to be all things at once on the 12th march 1827
clapperton was seized with dysentery nothing could check the progress
of the malady and he sank rapidly it being the time of the feast of
the rhamadan lander could get no help not even servants fever soon
set in and after twenty days of great suffering clapperton feeling
his end approaching gave his last instructions to lander and died in
that faithful servant's arms on the 11th of april

"i put a large clean mat" says lander "over the whole [the corpse]
and sent a messenger to sultan bello to acquaint him with the mournful
event and ask his permission to bury the body after the manner of my
own country and also to know in what particular place his remains were
to be interred the messenger soon returned with the sultan's consent
to the former part of my request and about twelve o'clock at noon of
the same day a person came into my hut accompanied by four slaves
sent by bello to dig the grave i was desired to follow them with the
corpse accordingly i saddled my camel and putting the body on its
back and throwing a union jack over it i bade them proceed
travelling at a slow pace we halted at jungavie a small village
built on a rising ground about five miles to the south-east of
sackatoo the body was then taken from the camel's back and placed in
a shed whilst the slaves were digging the grave which being quickly
done it was conveyed close to it i then opened a prayer-book and
amid showers of tears read the funeral service over the remains of my
valued master not a single person listened to this peculiarly
distressing ceremony the slaves being at some distance quarrelling
and making a most indecent noise the whole time it lasted this being
done the union jack was then taken off and the body was slowly
lowered into the earth and i wept bitterly as i gazed for the last
time upon all that remained of my generous and intrepid master"

[illustration "travelling at a slow pace"]

overcome by heat fatigue and grief poor lander himself now broke
down and for more than ten days was unable to leave his hut

bello sent several times to inquire after the unfortunate servant's
health but he was not deceived by these demonstrations of interest
for he knew they were only dictated by a wish to get possession of the
traveller's baggage which was supposed to be full of gold and silver
the sultan's astonishment may therefore be imagined when it came out
that lander had not even money enough to defray the expenses of his
journey to the coast he never found out that the servant had taken the
precaution of hiding his own gold watch and those of pearce and
clapperton about his person

lander saw that he must at any cost get back to the coast as quickly as
possible by dint of the judicious distribution of a few presents he
won over some of the sultan's advisers who represented to their master
that should lander die he would be accused of having murdered him as
well as clapperton although clapperton had advised lander to join an
arab caravan for fezzan the latter fearing that his papers and
journals might be taken from him resolved to go back to the coast

on the 3rd may lander at last left sackatoo en route for kano during
the first part of this journey he nearly died of thirst but he
suffered less in the second half as the king of djacoba who had
joined him was very kind to him and begged him to visit his country
this king told him that the niam-niams were his neighbours that they
had once joined him against the sultan of bornou and that after the
battle they had roasted and eaten the corpses of the slain this i
believe is the first mention since the publication of hornemann's
travels of this cannibal race who were to become the subjects of so
many absurd fables

lander entered kano on the 25th may and after a short stay there
started for funda on the niger whose course he proposed following to
benin this route had much to recommend it being not only safe but
new so that lander was enabled to supplement the discoveries of his
master

kanfoo carifo gowgie and gatas were visited in turns by lander who
says that the people of these towns belong to the houssa race and pay
tribute to the fellatahs he also saw damoy drammalik and coudonia
passed a wide river flowing towards the quorra and visited kottop a
huge slave and cattle market coudgi and dunrora with a long chain of
lofty mountains running in an easterly direction beyond

at dunrora just as lander was superintending the loading of his beasts
of burden four horsemen their steeds covered with foam dashed up to
the chief and with his aid forced lander to retrace his steps to visit
the king of zegzeg who they said was very anxious to see him this
was by no means agreeable to lander who wanted to get to the niger
from which he was not very far distant and down it to the sea he was
however obliged to yield to force his guides did not follow exactly
the same route as he had taken on his way to dunrora and thus he had
an opportunity of seeing the village of eggebi governed by one of the
chief of the warriors of the sovereign of zegzeg he paid his respects
as required excusing the small value of the presents he had to give on
the ground of his merchandise having been stolen and soon obtained
permission to leave the place

yaourie womba coulfo boussa and wow-wow were the halting-places on
lander's return journey to badagry where he arrived on the 22nd
november 1827 two months later he embarked for england

although the commercial project which had been the chief aim of
clapperton's journey had fallen through owing to the jealousy of the
arabs who opposed it in their fear that the opening of a new route
might ruin their trade a good deal of scientific information had
rewarded the efforts of the english explorer

in his "history of maritime and inland discovery" desborough cooley
thus sums up the results obtained by the travellers whose work we have
just described 

"the additions to our geographical knowledge of the interior of africa
which we owe to captain clapperton far exceed in extent and importance
those made by any preceding traveller the limit of captain lyon's
journey southward across the desert was in lat 24 degrees while major
denham in his expedition to mandara reached lat 9 degrees 15
minutes thus adding 14-3/4 degrees or 900 miles to the extent
explored by europeans hornemann it is true had previously crossed
the desert and had proceeded as far southwards as niffé in lat 10
degrees 30 minutes but no account was ever received of his journey
park in his first expedition reached silla in long 1 degree 34
minutes west a distance of 1100 miles from the mouth of the gambia
denham and clapperton on the other hand from the east side of lake
tchad in long 17 degrees to sackatoo in long 5 degrees 30 minutes
explored a distance of 700 miles from east to west in the heart of
africa a line of only 400 miles remaining unknown between silla and
sackatoo the second journey of captain clapperton added ten-fold value
to these discoveries for he had the good fortune to detect the
shortest and most easy road to the populous countries of the interior
and he could boast of being the first who had completed an itinerary
across the continent of africa from tripoli to benin"

we need add but little to so skilful and sensible a summary of the work
done the information given by arab geographers especially by leo
africanus had been verified and much had been learnt about a large
portion of the soudan although the course of the niger had not yet
been actually traced that was reserved for the expeditions of which we
are now to write it had been pretty fairly guessed at it had been
finally ascertained that the quorra or djoliba or niger or whatever
else the great river of north-west africa might be called and the nile
were totally different rivers with totally different sources in a
word a great step had been gained

in 1816 it was still an open question whether the congo was not
identical with the niger to ascertain the truth on this point an
expedition was sent out under captain tuckey an english naval officer
who had given proof of intelligence and courage james kingston tuckey
was made prisoner in 1805 and was not exchanged until 1814 when he
heard that an expedition was to be organized for the exploration of the
zaire he begged to be allowed to join it and was appointed to the
command two able officers and some scientific men were associated with
him

tuckey left england on the 19th march 1816 with two vessels the
congo and the dorothea a transport vessel under his orders on
the 20th june he cast anchor off malembé on the shores of the congo
in lat 4 degrees 39 minutes s the king of that country was much
annoyed when he found that the english had not come to buy slaves and
spread all manner of injurious reports against the europeans who had
come to ruin his trade

on the 18th july tuckey entered the vast estuary formed by the mouths
of the zaire on board the congo but when the height of the
river-banks rendered it impossible to sail farther he embarked with
some of his people in his boats on the 10th august he decided on
account of the rapidity of the current and the huge rocks bordering the
stream to make his way partly by land and partly by water ten days
later the boats were brought to a final stand by an impassable fall
the explorers therefore landed and continued their journey on foot
but the difficulties increased every day the europeans falling ill
and the negroes refusing to carry the baggage at last when he was
some 280 miles from the sea tuckey was compelled to retrace his steps
the rainy season had set in the number of sick increased and the
commander miserable at the lamentable result of the trip himself
succumbed to fever and only got back to his vessel to die on the 4th
october 1816

[illustration view on the banks of the congo (fac-simile of early

an exact survey of the mouth of the congo and the rectification of the
coast-line in which there had previously been a considerable error
were the only results of this unlucky expedition

in 1807 not far from the scene of clapperton's landing a few years
later a brave but fierce people appeared on the gold coast the
ashantees coming none knew exactly whence flung themselves upon the
fantees and after horrible massacres in 1811 and 1816 established
themselves in the whole of the country between the kong mountains and
the sea

[illustration ashantee warrior (fac-simile of early engraving)]

as a necessary result this led to a disturbance in the relations
between the fantees and the english who owned some factories and
counting-houses on the coast

in 1816 the ashantee king ravaged the fantee territories in which the
english had settled reducing the latter to famine the governor of
cape coast castle therefore sent a petition home for aid against the
fierce and savage conqueror the bearer of the governor's despatches
was thomas edward bowditch a young man who actuated by a passion for
travelling had left the parental roof thrown up his business and
having married against the wishes of his family had finally accepted a
humble post at cape coast castle where his uncle was second in
command

the english minister at once acceded to the governor's request and
sent bowditch back in command of an expedition but the authorities at
cape coast considered him too young for the post and superseded him by
a man whose long experience and thorough knowledge of the country and
its people seemed to fit him for the important task to be accomplished
the result showed that this was an error bowditch was attached to the
mission as scientific observer his chief duty being to take the
latitude and longitude of the different places visited

frederick james and bowditch left the english settlement on the 22nd
august 1817 and arrived at coomassie the ashantee capital without
meeting with any other obstacle than the insubordination of the
bearers the negotiations with a view to the conclusion of a treaty of
commerce and the opening of a road between coomassie and the coast
were brought to something of a successful issue by bowditch but james
proved himself altogether wanting in either the power of making or
enforcing suggestions the wisdom of bowditch's conduct was fully
recognized and james was recalled

it would seem that geographical science had little to expect from a
diplomatic mission to a country already visited by bosman loyer des
marchais and many others and on which meredith and dalzel had
written but bowditch turned to account his stay of five months at
coomassie which is but ten days' march from the atlantic to study the
country manners customs and institutions of one of the most
interesting races of africa

we will now briefly describe the pompous entry of the english mission
into coomassie the whole population turned out on the occasion and
all the troops whose numbers bowditch estimated at 30000 at least
were under arms

before they were admitted to the presence of the king the english
witnessed a scene well calculated to impress upon them the cruelty and
barbarity of the ashantees a man with his hands tied behind him his
cheeks pierced with wire one ear cut off the other hanging by a bit
of skin his shoulders bleeding from cuts and slashes and a knife run
through the skin above each shoulder-blade was dragged by a cord
fastened to his nose through the town to the music of bamboos he was
on his way to be sacrificed in honour of the white men

"our observations en passant" says bowditch "had taught us to
conceive a spectacle far exceeding our original expectations but they
had not prepared us for the extent and display of the scene which here
burst upon us an area of nearly a mile in circumference was crowded
with magnificence and novelty the king his tributaries and captains
were resplendent in the distance surrounded by attendants of every
description fronted by a mass of warriors which seemed to make our
approach impervious the sun was reflected with a glare scarcely more
supportable than the heat from the massive gold ornaments which
glistened in every direction more than a hundred bands burst at once
on our arrival into the peculiar airs of their several chiefs the
horns flourished their defiances with the beating of innumerable drums
and metal instruments and then yielded for a while to the soft
harmonious breathings of their long flutes with which a pleasing
instrument like a bagpipe without the drone was happily blended at
least a hundred large umbrellas or canopies which could shelter thirty
persons were sprung up and down by the bearers with brilliant effect
being made of scarlet yellow and the most showy cloths and silks and
crowned on the top with crescents pelicans elephants barrels and
arms and swords of gold

"the king's messengers with gold breastplates made way for us and we
commenced our round preceded by the canes and the english flag we
stopped to take the hand of every caboceer (which as their household
suites occupied several spaces in advance delayed us long enough to
distinguish some of the ornaments in the general blaze of splendour and
ostentation) the caboceers as did their superior captains and
attendants wore ashantee cloths of extravagant price from the costly
foreign silks which had been unravelled to weave them in all the
varieties of colour as well as pattern they were of an incredible size
and weight and thrown over the shoulder exactly like the roman toga a
small silk fillet generally encircled their temples and massy gold
necklaces intricately wrought suspended moorish charms inclosed in
small square cases of gold silver and curious embroidery some wore
necklaces reaching to the navel entirely of aggry beads a band of
gold and beads encircled the knee from which several strings of the
same depended small circles of gold like guineas rings and casts of
animals were strung round their ancles their sandals were of green
red and delicate white leather manillas and rude lumps of rock gold
hung from their left wrists which were so heavily laden as to be
supported on the head of one of their handsomest boys gold and silver
pipes and canes dazzled the eye in every direction wolves' and rams'
heads as large as life cast in gold were suspended from their
gold-handled swords which were held around them in great numbers the
blades were shaped like round bills and rusted in blood the sheaths
were of leopard skin or the shell of a fish like shagreen the large
drums supported on the head of one man and beaten by two others were
braced around with the thigh-bones of their enemies and ornamented
with their skulls the kettle-drums resting on the ground were
scraped with wet fingers and covered with leopard skin the wrists of
the drummers were hung with bells and curiously-shaped pieces of iron
which jingled loudly as they were beating the smaller drums were
suspended from the neck by scarves of red cloth the horns (the teeth
of young elephants) were ornamented at the mouth-piece with gold and
the jaw-bones of human victims the war-caps of eagles' feathers nodded
in the rear and large fans of the wing feathers of the ostrich
played around the dignitaries immediately behind their chairs (which
were of a black wood almost covered by inlays of ivory and gold
embossment) stood their handsomest youths with corslets of leopard's
skin covered with gold cockle-shells and stuck full of small knives
sheathed in gold and silver and the handles of blue agate
cartouch-boxes of elephant's hide hung below ornamented in the same
manner a large gold-handled sword was fixed behind the left shoulder
and silk scarves and horses' tails (generally white) streamed from the
arms and waist cloth their long danish muskets had broad rims of gold
at small distances and the stocks were ornamented with shells
finely-grown girls stood behind the chairs of some with silver basins
their stools (of the most laborious carved work and generally with two
large bells attached to them) were conspicuously placed on the heads of
favourites and crowds of small boys were seated around flourishing
elephants' tails curiously mounted the warriors sat on the ground
close to these and so thickly as not to admit of our passing without
treading on their feet to which they were perfectly indifferent their
caps were of the skin of the pangolin and leopard the tails hanging
down behind their cartouch-belts (composed of small gourds which hold
the charges and covered with leopard's or pig's skin) were embossed
with red shells and small brass bells thickly hung to them on their
hips and shoulders was a cluster of knives iron chains and collars
dignified the most daring who were prouder of them than of gold their
muskets had rests affixed of leopard's skin and the locks a covering
of the same the sides of their faces were curiously painted in long
white streaks and their arms also striped having the appearance of
armour

"we were suddenly surprised by the sight of moors who afforded the
first general diversity of dress there were seventeen superiors
arrayed in large cloaks of white satin richly trimmed with spangled
embroidery their shirts and trousers were of silk and a very large
turban of white muslin was studded with a border of different coloured
stones their attendants wore red caps and turbans and long white
shirts which hung over their trousers those of the inferiors were of
dark blue cloth they slowly raised their eyes from the ground as we
passed and with a most malignant scowl

"the prolonged flourishes of the horns a deafening tumult of drums
and the fuller concert at the intervals announced that we were
approaching the king we were already passing the principal officers of
his household the chamberlain the gold horn blower the captain of
the messengers the captain for royal executions the captain of the
market the keeper of the royal burying-ground and the master of the
bands sat surrounded by a retinue and splendour which bespoke the
dignity and importance of their offices the cook had a number of small
services covered with leopard's skin held behind him and a large
quantity of massy silver plate was displayed before him punch-bowls
waiters coffee-pots tankards and a very large vessel with heavy
handles and clawed feet which seemed to have been made to hold
incense i observed a portuguese inscription on one piece and they
seemed generally of that manufacture the executioner a man of immense
size wore a massy gold hatchet on his breast and the execution stool
was held before him clotted in blood and partly covered with a cawl
of fat the king's four linguists were encircled by a splendour
inferior to none and their peculiar insignia gold canes were
elevated in all directions tied in bundles like fasces the keeper of
the treasury added to his own magnificence by the ostentatious display
of his service the blow pan boxes scales and weights were of solid
gold

"a delay of some minutes whilst we severally approached to receive the
king's hand afforded us a thorough view of him his deportment first
excited my attention native dignity in princes we are pleased to call
barbarous was a curious spectacle his manners were majestic yet
courteous and he did not allow his surprise to beguile him for a
moment of the composure of the monarch he appeared to be about
thirty-eight years of age inclined to corpulence and of a benevolent
countenance"

this account is followed by a description extending over several
pages of the costume of the king the filing past of the chiefs and
troops the dispersing of the crowd and the ceremonies of reception
which lasted far on into the night

reading bowditch's extraordinary narrative we are tempted to ask if it
be not the outcome of the traveller's imagination for we can scarcely
credit what he says of the wonderful luxury of this barbarous court
the sacrifice of thousands of persons at certain seasons of the year
the curious customs of this warlike and cruel people this mixture of
barbarism and civilization hitherto unknown in africa we could not
acquit bowditch of great exaggeration had not later travellers as well
as contemporary explorers confirmed his statements we can therefore
only express our astonishment that such a government founded on terror
alone could have endured so long

it is a pleasure to us frenchmen when we can quote the name of a
fellow-countryman amongst the many travellers who have risked their
lives in the cause of geographical science without abating our
critical acumen we feel our pulse quicken when we read of the dangers
and struggles of such travellers as mollien caillié de cailliaud and
letorzec

gaspar mollien was nephew to napoleon's minister of the treasury he
was on board the medusa but was fortunate enough to escape when that
vessel was shipwrecked and to reach the coast of the sahara in a boat
whence he made his way to senegal

the dangers from which mollien had just escaped would have destroyed
the love of adventure and exploration in a less ardent spirit they had
no such effect upon him he left st louis as soon as ever he obtained
the assent of the governor fleuriau to his proposal to explore the
sources of the great rivers of senegambia and especially those of the
djoliba

mollien started from djeddeh on the 29th january 1818 and taking an
easterly course between the 15th and 16th parallels of north latitude
crossed the kingdom of domel and entered the districts peopled by the
yaloofs unable to go by way of woolli he decided in favour of the
fouta toro route and in spite of the jealousy of the natives and their
love of pillage he reached bondou without accident it took him three
days to traverse the desert between bondou and the districts beyond the
gambia after which he penetrated into niokolo a mountainous country
inhabited by the all but wild peuls and djallons

leaving bandeia mollien entered fouta djallon and reached the sources
of the gambia and the rio grande which are in close proximity a few
days later he came to those of the falemé and in spite of the
repugnance and fear of his guide he made his way into timbo the
capital of fouta the absence of the king and most of the inhabitants
probably spared him from a long captivity abbreviated only by torture
fouta is a fortified town the king owns houses with mud walls between
three and four feet thick and fifteen high

at a short distance from timbo mollien discovered the sources of the
senegal at least what were pointed out to him as such by the blacks
but it was impossible for him to take astronomical observations

the explorer did not however look upon his work as done he had ever
before him the still more important discovery of the sources of the
niger but the feeble state of his health the setting in of the rainy
season the swelling of the rivers the fears of his guides who
refused to accompany him into kooranko and soolimano though he offered
them guns amber beads and even his horse compelled him to give up
the idea of crossing the kong mountains and to return to st louis
mollien had however opened several new lines in a part of senegambia
not before visited by any european

"it is to be regretted" says m de la renaudière "that worn out with
fatigue scarcely able to drag himself along in a state of positive
destitution mollien was unable to cross the lofty mountains separating
the basin of the senegal from that of the djoliba and that he was
compelled to rely upon native information respecting the most important
objects of his expedition it is on the faith of the assertions of the
natives that he claims to have visited the sources of the rio grande
falemé gambia and senegal if he had been able to follow the course
of those rivers to their fountainhead his discoveries would have
acquired certainty which is unfortunately now wanting to them
however when we compare the accounts of other travellers with what he
says of the position of the source of the ba-fing or senegal which
cannot be that of any other great stream we are convinced of the
reality of this discovery at least it also seems certain that the two
last springs are higher up than was supposed and that the djoliba
rises in a yet loftier locality the country rises gradually to the
south and south-east in parallel terraces these mountain chains
increase in height towards the east attaining their greatest elevation
between lat 8 degrees and 10 degrees n"

such were the results of mollien's interesting journey in the french
colony of senegal the same country was the starting-point of another
explorer réné caillié

caillié who was born in 1800 in the department of the seine et oise
had only an elementary education but reading robinson crusoe had fired
his youthful imagination with a zeal for adventure and he never rested
until in spite of his scanty resources he had obtained maps and books
of travel in 1816 when only sixteen years old he embarked for
senegal in the transport-ship la loire

at this time the english government was organizing an inland exploring
expedition under the command of major gray to avoid the terrible
almamy of timbo who had been so fatal to peddie the english made for
the mouth of the gambia by sea woolli and the gaboon were crossed and
the explorers penetrated into bondou which mollien was to visit a few
years later a district inhabited by a people as fanatic and fierce as
those of fouta djallon the extortions of the almamy were such that
under pretext of there being an old debt left unpaid by the english
government major gray was mulcted of nearly all his baggage and had
to send an officer to the senegal for a fresh supply

caillié knowing nothing of this disastrous beginning and aware that
gray was glad to receive new recruits left st louis with two negroes
and reached goree but there some people who took an interest in him
persuaded him not to take service with gray and got him an appointment
at guadaloupe he remained however but six months in that island and
then returned to bordeaux whence he started for the senegal once more

partarieu one of gray's officers was just going back to his chief
with the merchandise he had procured and caillié asked and obtained
leave to accompany him without either pay or a fixed engagement

[illustration réné caillié (fac-simile of early engraving)]

the caravan consisted of seventy persons black and white and
thirty-two richly-laden camels it left gandiolle in cayor on the 5th
february 1819 and before entering jaloof a desert was crossed where
great suffering was endured from thirst the leader in order to carry
more merchandise had neglected to take a sufficient supply of water

at boolibaba a village inhabited by foulah shepherds the travellers
were enabled to recruit and to fill their leathern bottles for a
journey across a second desert

avoiding fouta toro whose inhabitants are fanatics and thieves
partarieu entered bondou he would gladly have evaded visiting
boulibané the capital and residence of the almamy but was compelled
to do so owing to the refusal of the people to supply grain or water
to the caravan and also in obedience to the strict orders of major
gray who thought the almamy would let the travellers pass after paying
tribute

the terrible almamy began by extorting a great number of presents and
then refused to allow the english to visit bakel on the senegal they
might he said go through his states those of kaarta to clego or
they might take the fouta toro route both these alternatives were
equally impossible as in either case the caravan would have to travel
among fanatic tribes the explorers believed the almamy's object was to
have them robbed and murdered without incurring the personal
responsibility

they resolved to force their way preparations were scarcely begun for
a start when the caravan was surrounded by a multitude of soldiers
who taking possession of the wells rendered it impossible for the
travellers to carry out their intentions at the same time the war-drum
was beaten on every side to fight was impossible a palaver had to be
held in a word the english had to own their powerlessness the almamy
dictated the conditions of peace mulcted the whites of a few more
presents and ordered them to withdraw by way of fouta toro

yet more and this was a flagrant insult to british pride the english
found themselves escorted by a guard which prevented their taking any
other route when night fell they revenged themselves by setting fire
to all their merchandise in the very sight of the foulahs who had
intended to get possession of them the crossing of fouta toro among
hostile natives was terribly arduous the slightest pretext was seized
for a dispute and again and again violence seemed inevitable food and
water were only to be obtained at exorbitant prices

at last one night partarieu to disarm the suspicion of the natives
gave out that he could not carry all his baggage at once and having
first filled his coffers and bags with stones he decamped with all his
followers for the senegal leaving his tents pitched and his fires
alight his path was strewn with bales arms and animals thanks to
this subterfuge and the rapidity of their march the english reached
bakel in safety where the french welcomed the remnant of the
expedition with enthusiasm

[illustration "he decamped with all his followers"]

caillié attacked by a fever which nearly proved fatal returned to st
louis but not recovering his health there he was obliged to go back
to france not until 1824 was he able to return to senegal which was
then governed by baron roger a friend to progress who was anxious
pari passu to extend our geographical knowledge with our commercial
relations roger supplied caillié with means to go and live amongst the
bracknas there to study arabic and the mussulman religion

life amongst the suspicious and fanatic moorish shepherds was by no
means easy the traveller who had great difficulty in keeping his
daily journal was obliged to resort to all manner of subterfuges to
obtain permission to explore the neighbourhood of his house he gives
us some curious details of the life of the bracknas of their diet
which consists almost entirely of milk of their habitations which are
nothing more than tents unfitted for the vicissitudes of the climate
of their "guéhués" or itinerant minstrels their mode of producing
the excessive embonpoint which they consider the height of female
beauty the aspect of the country the fertility and productions of the
soil &c

the most remarkable of all the facts collected by caillié are those
relating to the five distinct classes into which the moorish bracknas
are divided these are the hassanes or warriors whose idleness
slovenliness and pride exceed belief the marabouts or priests the
zénagues tributary to the hassanes the laratines and the slaves

the zénagues are a miserable class despised by all the others but
especially by the hassanes to whom they pay a tribute which is of
variable amount and is never considered enough they do all the work
both industrial and agricultural and rear all the cattle

"in spite of my efforts" says caillié "i could find out nothing about
the origin of this people or ascertain how they came to be reduced to
pay tribute to other moors when i asked them any questions about this
they said it was god's will can they be a remnant of a conquered
tribe? and if so how is it that no tradition on the subject is
retained amongst them i do not think they can be for the moors proud
as they are of their origin never forget the names of those who have
brought credit to their families and were such the case the zénagues
who form the majority of the population and are skilful warriors
would rise under the leadership of one of their chiefs and fling off
the yoke of servitude"

laratine is the name given to the offspring of a moor and a negro
slave although they are slaves the laratines are never sold but
while living in separate camps are treated very much like the
zénagues those who are the sons of hassanes are warriors whilst the
children of marabouts are brought up to the profession of their father

the actual slaves are all negroes ill-treated badly fed and flogged
on the slightest pretext there is no suffering which they are not
called upon to endure

in may 1825 caillié returned to st louis baron roger was absent
and his representative was by no means friendly the explorer had to
content himself with the pay of a common soldier until the return of
his protector to whom he sent the notes he had made when amongst the
bracknas but all his offers of service were rejected he was promised
a certain sum on his return from timbuctoo but how was he even to
start without private resources?

the intrepid caillié was not however to be discouraged as he
obtained neither encouragement nor help from the colonial government
he went to sierra leone where the governor who did not wish to
deprive major laing of the credit of being the first to arrive at
timbuctoo rejected his proposals

in the management of an indigo factory caillié soon saved money to the
extent of two thousand francs a sum which appeared to him sufficient
to carry him to the end of the world he lost no time in purchasing the
necessary merchandise and joined some mandingoes and "seracolets" or
wandering african merchants he told them under the seal of secrecy
that he had been born in egypt of arab parents taken to france at an
early age and sent to senegal to look after the business of his
master who satisfied with his services had given him his freedom he
added that his chief desire was to get back to egypt and resume the
mohammedan religion

on the 22nd march 1827 caillié left freetown for kakondy a village
on the rio nuñez where he employed his leisure in collecting
information respecting the landamas and the nalous both subject to the
foulahs of fouta djallon but not mohammedans and as a necessary
result both much given to spirituous liquors they dwell in the
districts watered by the rio nuñez side by side with the bagos an
idolatrous race who dwell at its mouth the bagos are light-hearted
industrious and skilful tillers of the soil they make large profits
out of the sale of their rice and salt they have no king no religion
but a barbarous idolatry and are governed by the oldest man in their
village an arrangement which answers very well

on the 19th april 1827 caillié with but one bearer and a guide at
last started for timbuctoo he speaks favourably of the foulahs and the
people of fouta djallon whose rich and fertile country he crossed the
ba-fing the chief affluent of the senegal was not more than a hundred
paces across and a foot and a half deep where he passed it but the
force of the current and the huge granite rocks encumbering its bed
render it very difficult and dangerous to cross the river after a halt
of nineteen days in the village of cambaya the home of the guide who
had accompanied him thus far caillié entered kankan crossing a
district intersected by rivers and large streams which were then
beginning to inundate the whole land

on the 30th may the explorer crossed the tankisso a large river with a
rocky bed belonging to the system of the niger and reached the latter
on the 11th june at couronassa

[illustration caillié crossing the tankisso]

"even here" says caillié "so near to its source the niger is 900
feet wide with a current of two miles and a half"

before we enter kankan with the french explorer it will be well to sum
up what he says of the foulahs of fouta they are mostly tall
well-made men with chestnut-brown complexions curly hair lofty
foreheads aquiline noses features in fact very like those of
europeans they are bigoted mohammedans and hate christians unlike
the mandingoes they do not travel but love their home they are good
agriculturists and clever traders warlike and patriotic and they
leave none but their old men and women in their villages when they go
to war

the town of kankan stands in a plain surrounded by lofty mountains the
bombax baobab and butter-tree also called "cé" the "shea" of mungo
park are plentiful caillié was delayed in kankan for twenty-eight
days before he could get on to sambatikala and during that time he was
shamefully robbed by his host and could not obtain from the chief of
the village restitution of the goods which had been stolen

"kankan" says the traveller "is a small town near the left bank of
the milo a pretty river which comes from the south and waters the
kissi district where it takes its rise flowing thence in a
north-westerly direction to empty itself into the niger two or three
days' journey from kankan surrounded by a thick quick-set hedge this
town which does not contain more than 6000 inhabitants is situated in
an extensive and very fertile plain of grey sand on every side are
pretty little villages called worondes where the slaves live these
habitations give interest to the scene and are surrounded by very fine
plantations yams rice onions pistachio nuts &c are exported in
large quantities"

between kankan and wassolo the road led through well cultivated and
at this time of year nearly submerged districts the inhabitants
struck caillié as being of a mild cheerful and inquiring disposition
they gave him a cordial welcome

several tributaries of the niger including the sarano were passed
before a halt was made at sigala the residence of baranusa the chief
of wassolo he was of slovenly habits like his subjects and used
tobacco both as snuff and for smoking he was said to be very rich in
gold and slaves his subjects paid him a tribute in cattle he had a
great many wives each of whom owned a hut of her own their houses
forming a little village with well cultivated environs here caillié
for the first time saw the rhamnus lotus mentioned by park

on leaving wossolo caillié entered foulou whose inhabitants like
those of the former district are idolaters of slovenly habits they
speak the mandingo tongue at sambatikala the traveller paid a visit to
the almamy

"we entered" he says "a place which served him as a bedroom for
himself and a stable for his horse the prince's bed was at the further
end it consisted of a little platform raised six inches from the
ground on which was stretched an ox hide with a dirty mosquito
curtain to keep off the insects there was no other furniture in this
royal abode two saddles hung from stakes driven into the wall a large
straw hat a drum only used in war-time a few lances a bow a quiver
and some arrows were the only ornaments a lamp made of a piece of
flat iron set on a stand of the same metal stood on the ground this
lamp was fed by a kind of vegetable matter not thick enough to be made
into candles"

the almamy soon informed caillié of an opportunity for him to go to
timeh whence a caravan was about to start for jenneh the traveller
then entered the province of bambarra and quickly arrived at the
pretty little village of timeh inhabited by mohammedan mandingoes and
bounded on the east by a chain of mountains about 350 fathoms high

when he entered this village at the end of july caillié little dreamt
of the long stay he would be compelled to make in it he had hurt his
foot and the wound became very much inflamed by walking in wet grass
he therefore decided to let the caravan for jenneh go on without him
and remain at timeh until his foot should be completely healed it
would have been too great a risk for him in his state to travel through
bambarra where the idolatrous inhabitants of the country would be
pretty sure to rob him

"the bambarras" he says "have few slaves go almost naked and are
always armed with bows and arrows they are governed by a number of
petty independent chiefs who are often at war with one another they
are in fact rude and wild creatures as compared with the tribes who
have embraced mohammedanism"

caillié was detained at timeh by the still unhealed wound in his foot
until the 10th november at that date he proposed starting for jenneh
but to quote his own words "i was now seized with violent pains in
the jaws warning me that i was attacked with scurvy a terrible
malady all the horrors of which i was to realize my palate was
completely skinned part of the bone came away my teeth seemed ready
to fall out of the gums my sufferings were terrible i feared that my
brain might be affected by the agony of pain in my head i was more
than a fortnight without an instant's sleep"

to make matters worse the wound broke out afresh and he would have
been cured neither of it nor of the scurvy had it not been for the
energetic treatment of an old negress who was accustomed to doctor the
scorbutic affections so common in that country

on the 9th january 1828 caillié left timeh and reached kimba a
little village where the caravan for jenneh was assembled near to this
village rises the chain erroneously called kong which is the general
name for mountain amongst the mandingoes

the names of the villages entered by the travellers and the incidents
of the journey through bambarra are of no special interest the
inhabitants are accounted great thieves by the mandingoes but are
probably not more dishonest than their critics

the bambarra women all wear a thin slip of wood imbedded in the lower
lip a strange fashion exactly similar to that noticed by cook amongst
the natives of the north-western coast of america the bambarras speak
mandingo though they have a dialect of their own called kissour
about which the traveller could obtain no trustworthy written
information

jenneh was formerly called "the golden land" the precious metal is
not however found there but a good deal is imported by the boureh
merchants and the mandingoes of kong

jenneh two miles and a half in circumference is surrounded by a mud
wall ten feet high the houses built of bricks baked in the sun are
as large as those of european peasants they have all terraces but no
outer windows numbers of foreigners frequent jenneh the inhabitants
as many as eight or ten thousand are very industrious and intelligent
they hire out their slaves and also employ them in various
handicrafts

the moors however monopolize the more important commerce not a day
passes that they do not despatch huge boats laden with rice millet
cotton honey vegetable butter and other native products

in spite of this great commercial movement the prosperity of jenneh
was threatened sego ahmadou chief of the country impelled by bigoted
zeal made fierce war upon the bambarras of sego whom he wished to
rally round the standard of the prophet this struggle did a great deal
of harm to the trade of jenneh for it interrupted intercourse with
yamina sansanding bamakou and boureh which were the chief marts for
its produce

the women of jenneh would not be true to their sex if they did not show
some marks of coquetry those who aim at fashion pass a ring or a glass
ornament through the nostrils whilst their poorer sisters content
themselves with a bit of pink silk

during caillié's long stay at jenneh he was loaded with kindness and
attentions by the moors to whom he had told the fabulous tale about
his birth in egypt and abduction by the army of occupation

on the 23rd march the traveller embarked on the niger for timbuctoo
on which the sheriff won over by the gift of an umbrella had obtained
a passage for him he carried with him letters of introduction to the
chief persons in timbuctoo

caillié now passed in succession the pretty villages of kera taguetia
sankha-guibila diebeh and isaca near to which the river is joined by
an important branch which makes a great bend beyond sego catching
sight also of wandacora wanga corocoïla and cona finally reaching
on the 2nd of april the mouth of the important lake debo

"land" says caillié "is visible on every side of this lake except on
the west where it widens out like a vast inland sea following its
northern coast in a west-north-west direction for a distance of fifteen
miles you leave on the left a tongue of level ground which runs
several miles to the south seeming to bar the passage of the lake and
form a kind of strait beyond this barrier the lake stretches away out
of sight in the west the barrier i have just described cuts lake debo
into two parts the upper and lower that navigable to boats contains
three islands and is very wide it stretches away a short distance on
the east and is supplemented by an immense number of huge marshes"

one after the other caillié now passed the fishing village of gabibi
tongoon in the diriman country a district stretching far away on the
east codosa an important commercial town barconga leleb garfolo
baracondieh tircy talbocoïla salacoïla cora coratou where the
tuaricks exact a toll from passing boats and finally reached cabra
built on a height out of reach of the overflowing of the niger and
serving as the port of timbuctoo

on the 20th caillié disembarked and started for that city which he
entered at sundown

"i at last" cries our hero "saw the capital of the soudan which had
so long been the goal of my desires as i entered that mysterious town
an object of curiosity to the civilized nations of europe i was filled
with indescribable exultation i never experienced anything like it
and my delight knew no bounds but i had to moderate my transports and
it was to god alone i confided them with what earnestness i thanked
him for the success which had crowned my enterprise and the signal
protection he had accorded me in so many apparently insurmountable
difficulties and perils my first emotions having subsided i found
that the scene before me by no means came up to my expectations i had
conceived a very different idea of the grandeur and wealth of this
town at first sight it appeared nothing more than a mass of
badly-built houses whilst on every side stretched vast plains of arid
yellowish shifting sands the sky was of a dull red colour on the
horizon all nature seemed melancholy profound silence prevailed not
so much as the song of a bird was heard and yet there was something
indescribably imposing in the sight of a large town rising up in the
midst of the sandy desert and the beholder cannot but admire the
indomitable energy of its founders i fancy the river formerly passed
nearer the town of timbuctoo it is now eight miles north of it and
five of cabra"

[illustration view of part of timbuctoo (fac-simile of early
engraving)]

timbuctoo which is neither so large nor so well populated as caillié
expected is altogether wanting in animation there are no large
caravans constantly arriving in it as at jenneh nor are there so many
strangers there as in the latter town whilst the market held at three
o'clock in the morning on account of the heat appears deserted

timbuctoo is inhabited by kissour negroes who seem of mild
dispositions and are employed in trade there is no government and
strictly speaking no central authority each town and village has its
own chief the mode of life is patriarchal a great many moorish
merchants are settled in the town and rapidly make fortunes there
they receive consignments of merchandise from adrar tafilet ghât
ghâdames algiers tunis and tripoli

to timbuctoo is brought all the salt of the mines of toudeyni packed
on camels it is imported in slabs bound together by ropes made from
grass in the neighbourhood of tandayeh

timbuctoo is built in the form of a triangle and measures about three
miles in circumference the houses are large but not lofty and are
built of round bricks the streets are wide and clean there are seven
mosques each surmounted by a square tower from which the muezzin
calls the faithful to prayer counting the floating population the
capital of the soudan does not contain more than from ten to twelve
thousand inhabitants

timbuctoo situated in the midst of a vast plain of shifting white
sand trades in salt only the soil being quite unsuitable to any sort
of cultivation the town is always full of people who come to exact
what they call presents but what might with more justice be styled
forced contributions it is a public calamity when a tuarick chief
arrives he remains in the town a couple of months living with his
numerous followers at the expense of the inhabitants until he has
wrung costly presents from them terror has extended the domination of
these wandering tribes over all the neighbouring peoples whom they rob
and pillage without mercy

the tuarick costume is the same as that of the arabs with the
exception of the head-dress day and night they wear a cotton band
which covers the eyes and comes down over the nose so that they are
obliged to raise the head in order to see the same band goes once or
twice round the head and hides the mouth coming down below the chin
so that the tip of the nose is all that is visible

the tuaricks are perfect riders and mounted on first-rate horses or on
fleet camels each man is armed with a spear a shield and a dagger
they are the pirates of the desert and innumerable are the caravans
they have robbed or blackmailed

[illustration map of réné caillié's journey]

four days after caillié's arrival at timbuctoo he heard that a caravan
was about to start for talifet and as he knew that another would not
go for three months fearing detection he resolved to join this one
it consisted of a large number of merchants and 600 camels starting
on the 4th of may 1828 he arrived after terrible sufferings from the
heat and a sand-storm in which he was caught at el arawan a town of
no private resources but important as the emporium for the toudeyni
salt exported at sansanding on the banks of the niger and also as
the halting-place of caravans from tafilet mogadore ghât drat and
tripoli the merchants here exchanging european wares for ivory gold
slaves wax honey and soudan stuffs on the 19th may the caravan
left el arawan for morocco by way of the sahara to the traveller's
usual sufferings from heat thirst and privations of all kinds was
now added the pain of a wound incurred in a fall from his camel he was
also taunted by the moors and even by their slaves who ridiculed his
habits and his awkwardness and even sometimes threw stones at him when
his back was turned towards them

"often" says caillié "one of the moors would say to me in a
contemptuous tone 'you see that slave? well i prefer him to you so
you may guess in what esteem i hold you' this insult would be
accompanied with roars of laughter"

under these miserable circumstances caillié passed the wells of
trarzas in whose vicinity salt is found also those of amul gamil
amul taf el ekreif surrounded by date-trees wood willows and
rushes and reached marabouty and el harib districts whose inhabitants
are disgustingly dirty in their habits

el harib lies between two chains of low hills dividing it from
morocco to which it is tributary its inhabitants divided into
several nomad tribes employ themselves chiefly in the breeding of
camels they would be rich and contented but for the ceaseless
exactions of the berber arabs

on the 12th july the caravan left el harib and eleven days later
entered the province of talifet famous for its majestic date-trees at
ghourland caillié was welcomed with some kindness by the moors though
he was not admitted to their houses lest the women who are visible
only to the men of their own families should be seen by the irreverent
eyes of a stranger

caillié visited the market which is held three times a week near a
little village called boheim three miles from ghourland and was
surprised at the variety of articles exposed for sale in it
vegetables native fruits fodder for cattle poultry sheep &c &c
all in large quantities water in leather bottles was carried about for
sale to all who cared to drink in the exhausting heat by men who
announced their approach by ringing a small hand-bell moorish and
spanish coins alone passed current the province of tafilet contains
several large villages and small towns ghourland el ekseba sosso
boheim and ressant which our traveller visited contained some twelve
hundred inhabitants each all merchants and owners of property

the soil is very productive corn vegetables dates european fruits
and tobacco are cultivated in large quantities among the sources of
wealth in tafilet we may name very fine sheep whose beautifully white
wool makes very pretty coverlets oxen first-rate horses donkeys and
mules

as at el-drah a good many jews live in the villages together with
mohammedans they lead a miserable life go about half naked and are
constantly struck and insulted whether brokers shoemakers
blacksmiths porters or whatever their ostensible occupation they all
lend money to the moors

on the 2nd august the caravan resumed its march and after passing
a-fileh tanneyara marca dayara rahaba el eyarac tamaroc
ain-zeland el guim guigo and soporo caillié arrived at fez where
he made a short stay and then pressed on to rabat the ancient saléh
exhausted by his long march with nothing to eat but a few dates
obliged to depend on the charity of the mussulmans who as often as not
declined to give him anything and finding at fez no representative of
france but an old jew named ismail who acted as consular agent and
who being afraid of compromising himself would not let caillié embark
on a portuguese brig bound for gibraltar the traveller eagerly
availed himself of a fortunate chance for going to tangiers there he
was kindly received by the vice-consul m delaporte who wrote at once
to the commandant of the french station at cadiz and sent him off
bound for that port disguised as a sailor in a corvette

the landing at toulon of the young frenchman fresh from timbuctoo was
a very unexpected event in the scientific world with nothing to aid
him but his own invincible courage and patience he had brought to a
satisfactory conclusion an exploit for which the french and english
geographical societies had offered large rewards alone without any
resources to speak of without the aid of government or of any
scientific society by sheer force of will he had succeeded in
throwing a flood of new light on an immense tract of africa

caillié was not indeed the first european who had visited timbuctoo in
the preceding year major laing had penetrated into that mysterious
city but he had paid for his expedition with his life and we shall
presently relate the touching details of his fatal trip

caillié had returned to europe and brought back with him the curious
journal from which our narrative is taken it is true his profession of
the mohammedan faith had prevented him from taking astronomical
observations and from making sketches and notes freely but only at
the price of his seeming apostasy could he have passed through the
region where the very name of a christian is held in abhorrence

how many strange observations how many fresh and exact details did
caillié add to our knowledge of north-west africa it had cost
clapperton two journeys to traverse africa from tripoli to benin
caillié had crossed from senegal to morocco in one but at what a
price how much fatigue how much suffering how many privations had
the frenchman endured timbuctoo was known at last as well as the new
caravan route across the sahara by way of the oases of tafilet and el
harib

was caillié compensated for his physical and mental sufferings by the
aid which the geographical society sent to him at once by the prize of
10000 francs adjudged to him by the cross of the legion of honour and
the fame and glory attached to his name? we suppose he was he says
more than once in his narrative that nothing but his wish to add by his
discoveries to the glory of france his native country could have
sustained him under the trying circumstances and insults to which he
was constantly subjected all honour then to the patient traveller the
sincere patriot the great discoverer

we have still to speak of the expedition which cost alexander gordon
laing his life but before giving our necessarily brief account for
his journals were all lost we must say a few words about his early
life and an interesting excursion made by him to timmannee kouran and
soolimana when he discovered the sources of the niger

laing was born in edinburgh in 1794 entered the english army at the
age of sixteen and soon distinguished himself in 1820 he had gained
the rank of lieutenant and was serving as aide-de-camp to sir charles
maccarthy then governor general of western africa at this time war
was raging between amara the mandingo almamy and sannassi one of his
principal chiefs trade had never been very flourishing in sierra
leone and this state of things dealt it its death-blow maccarthy
anxious to put matters on a better footing determined to interfere and
bring about a reconciliation between the rival chiefs he decided on
sending an embassy to kambia on the borders of the scarcies and from
thence to malacoury and the mandingo camp the enterprising character
intelligence and courage of laing led to his being chosen by the
governor as his envoy and on the 7th january 1822 he received
instructions to report on the manufactures and topography of the
provinces mentioned and to ascertain the feeling of the inhabitants on
the abolition of slavery

a first interview with yareddi leader of the soolimana troops
accompanying the almamy proved that the negroes of the districts under
notice had only the vaguest ideas on european civilization and that
they had had but little intercourse with the whites

"every article of our dress" says laing "was a subject of admiration
observing me pull off my gloves yareddi stared covered his
widely-opened mouth with his hands and at length exclaimed 'alla
akbar' 'he has pulled the skin off his hands' by degrees and as he
became more familiar he alternately rubbed down dr mackie's hair and
mine then indulging himself in a loud laugh he would exclaim 'they
are not men they are not men' he repeatedly asked my interpreter if
we had bones?"

these preliminary excursions during which laing ascertained that many
soolimanas owned a good deal of gold and ivory led to his asking the
governor's sanction to explore the districts to the east of the colony
with a view to increasing the trade of sierra leone by admitting their
productions

maccarthy liked laing's proposal and submitted it to the council it
was decided that laing should be authorized to penetrate into soolimana
by the most convenient route for future communications

laing left sierra leone on the 16th april 1824 and rowed up the
rokelle river to rokon the chief town of timmannee his interview with
the king of rokon was extremely amusing to do him honour laing had a
salvo of ten charges fired as he came into the court in which the
reception was to be held at the noise the king stopped drew back
darted a furious look at his visitor and ran away it was with great
difficulty that the cowardly monarch was induced to return at last he
came back and seating himself with great dignity in his chair of state
he questioned the major

"he wished to know" says laing "why he had been fired at and was
with some difficulty persuaded that it had been done out of honour to
him 'why did you point your guns to the ground?' 'that you might see
our intention was to show you respect' 'but the pebbles flew in my
face why did you not point in the air?' 'because we feared to burn the
thatch on your houses' 'well then give me some rum'"

needless to add that the interview became more cordial after the major
had complied with this request

the portrait of the timmannee monarch deserves a place in our volume
for more than one reason it is a case of ab uno disce omnes"

"ba-simera" to quote laing again "the principal chief or king of this
part of the timmannee country is about ninety years of age with a
mottled shrivelled-up skin resembling in colour that of an alligator
more than that of a human being with dim greenish eyes far sunk in
his head and a bleached twisted beard hanging down about two feet
from his chin like the king of the opposite district he wore a
necklace of coral and leopard's teeth but his mantle was brown and
dirty as his skin his swollen legs like those of an elephant were to
be observed from under his trousers of baft which might have been
originally white but from the wear of several years had assumed a
greenish appearance"

like his predecessors in africa laing had to go through many
discussions about the right of passage through the country and bearers'
wages but thanks to his firmness he managed to escape the extortions
of the negro kings the chief halting-places on the route taken by the
major were toma where a white man had never before been seen
balandeko roketchnick which he ascertained to be situated in n lat
8 degrees 30 minutes and w long 12 degrees 11 minutes mabimg
beyond a very broad stream flowing north of the rokelle and ma-yosso
the chief frontier town of timmannee in timmannee laing made
acquaintance with a singular institution a kind of free-masonry known
as "purrah" the existence of which on the borders of the rio nuñez had
been already ascertained by caillié

"their power" [that of the "purrah"] says laing "supersedes even that
of the headmen of the districts and their deeds of secrecy and
darkness are as little called in question or inquired into as those
of the inquisition were in europe in former years i have endeavoured
in vain to trace the origin or cause of formation of this
extraordinary association and have reason to suppose that it is now
unknown to the generality of the timmannees and may possibly be even
so to the purrah themselves in a country where no traditionary records
are extant either in writing or in song"

so far as laing could ascertain timmannee is divided into three
districts the chief of each arrogates to himself the title of king
the soil is fairly productive and rice yams guavas earth-nuts and
bananas might be grown in plenty but for the lazy vicious and
avaricious character of the inhabitants who vie with each other in
roguery

"i think" says laing "that a few hoes flails rakes shovels &c
would be very acceptable to them when their respective uses were
practically explained and that they would prove more beneficial both
to their interest and ours than the guns cocked hats and mountebank
coats with which they are at present supplied" in spite of our
traveller's philanthropic wish things have not changed since his time
the negroes are just as fond of intoxicating drinks and their petty
kings still go about wearing on grand occasions hats the shape of an
accordion and blue coats with copper buttons with no shirts
underneath the maternal sentiment did not seem to laing to be very
fully developed amongst the people of timmannee for he was twice
roundly abused by women for refusing to buy their children of them a
few days later there was a great tumult raised against laing the white
man who had inflicted a fatal blow on the prosperity of the country by
checking its trade the first town entered in kouranko was maboum and
it is interesting to note en passant what laing says of the activity
of the inhabitants

"i entered the town about sunset and received a first impression
highly favourable to its inhabitants who were returning from their
respective labours of the day every individual bearing about him
proofs of his industrious occupation some had been engaged in
preparing the fields for the crops which the approaching rains were to
mature others were penning up cattle whose sleek sides and good
condition denoted the richness of their pasturages the last clink of
the blacksmith's hammer was sounding the weaver was measuring the
quantity of cloth he had woven during the day and the gaurange or
worker in leather was tying up his neatly-stained pouches shoes
knife-scabbards &c (the work of his handicraft) in a large kotakoo or
bag while the crier at the mosque with the melancholy call of 'alla
akbar' uttered at measured intervals summoned the dévôts moslems to
their evening devotions"

had a marilhat or a henri regnault transferred to canvas a scene like
this when the dazzling light of the sun is beginning to die away in
green and rose tints might he not aptly name his painting the retour
des champs a title so often given to landscapes in our misty climate

"this scene" adds laing "both by its nature and the sentiment which
it inspired formed an agreeable contrast with the noise confusion
and the dissipation which pervaded a timmannee town at the same hour
but one must not trust too much to appearances and i regret to add
that the subsequent conduct of the kouranko natives did not confirm the
good opinion which i had formed of them"

the traveller now passed through koufoula where he was very kindly
received crossed a pleasant undulating district shut in by the
kouranko hills and halted at simera where the chief ordered his
"guiriot" to celebrate in song the arrival of his guest a welcome
neutralized by the fact that the house assigned to laing let in the
rain through its leaky roof and would not let out the smoke so that
to use his own words he was more "like a chimney-sweeper" than the
white guest of the king of simera

laing afterwards visited the source of the tongolelle a tributary of
the rokelle and then left kooranko to enter soolimana kooranko into
which our traveller did not penetrate beyond the frontier is of vast
extent and divided into a great number of small states the inhabitants
resemble the mandingoes in language and costume but they are neither
so well looking nor so intelligent they do not profess mohammedanism
and have implicit confidence in their "grigris" they are fairly
industrious they know how to sew and weave their chief object of
commerce is rosewood or "cam" which they send to the coast the
products of the country are much the same as those of timmannee

komia n lat 9 degrees 22 minutes is the first town in soolimana
laing then visited semba a wealthy and populous city where he was
received by a band of musicians who welcomed him with a deafening if
not harmonious flourish of trumpets and he finally reached falaba the
capital of the country

the king received laing with special marks of esteem he had assembled
a large body of troops whom he passed in review making them execute
various manoeuvres accompanied by the blowing of trumpets beating of
tambourines and the playing of violins and other native instruments
this "fantasia" almost deafened the visitor then came a number of
guiriots who sang of the greatness of the king the happy arrival of
the major with the fortunate results which were to ensue from his
visit for the prosperity of the country and the development of
commerce

laing profited by the king's friendliness to ask his permission to
visit the sources of the niger but was answered by all manner of
objections on the score of the danger of the expedition at last
however his majesty yielded to the persuasions of his visitor telling
him that "as his heart panted after the water he might go to it"

the major had not however left falaba two hours before the permission
was rescinded and he had to give up an enterprise which had justly
appeared to him of great importance

a few days later he obtained leave to visit the source of the rokelle
or sale kongo a river of which nothing was known before his time
beyond rokon from the summit of a lofty rock laing saw mount loma
the highest of the chain of which it forms part "the point" says the
traveller "from which the niger issues was now shown to me and
appeared to be at the same level on which i stood viz 1600 feet
above the level of the atlantic the source of the rokelle which i had
already measured being 1470 feet the view from this hill amply
compensated for my lacerated feet having ascertained correctly the
situation of konkodoogore and that of the hill upon which i was at
this time the first by observation and the second by account and
having taken the bearings of loma from both i cannot err much in
laying down its position in 9 degrees 25 minutes n and 9 degrees 45
minutes w"

[illustration "laing saw mount loma"]

laing had now spent three months in soolimana and had made many
excursions it is a very picturesque country in which alternate hills
valleys and fertile plains bordered by woods and adorned with
thickets of luxuriant trees

the soil is fertile and requires very little cultivation the harvests
are abundant and rice grows well oxen sheep goats and a small
species of poultry with a few horses are the chief domestic animals
of the people of soolimana the wild beasts of which there are a good
many are elephants buffaloes a kind of antelope monkeys and
leopards

falaba which takes its name from the fala-ba river on which it is
situated is about a mile and a half long by one broad the houses are
closer together than in most african towns and it contains some six
thousand inhabitants its position as a fortified town is well-chosen
built on an eminence in the centre of a plain which is under water in
the rainy season it is surrounded by a very strong wooden palisade
proof against every engine of war except artillery

strange to say in soolimana the occupations of men and women seem to be
reversed the latter work in the fields except at seed time and
harvest build the houses act as masons barbers and surgeons whilst
the men attend to the dairy milk the cows sew and wash the linen

on the 17th september laing started on his return journey to sierra
leone bearing presents from the king and escorted for several miles by
a vast crowd he finally reached the english colony in safety

laing's trip through timmannee kooranko and soolimana was not without
importance it opened up districts hitherto unknown to europeans and
introduced us to the manners occupations and trade of the people as
well as to the products of the country at the same time the course was
traced and the source discovered of the rokelle whilst for the first
time definite information was obtained as to the sources of the niger
for although our traveller had not actually visited them he had gone
near enough to determine their position approximately

the results obtained by laing on this journey only fired his ambition
for further discoveries he therefore determined to make his way to
timbuctoo

on the 17th june 1825 he embarked at malta for tripoli where he
joined a caravan with which hateeta the tuarick chief who had made
such friends with lyon was also travelling as far as ghât after two
months' halt at ghadames laing again started in october and reached
insalah which he places a good deal further west than his predecessors
had done here he remained from november 1825 to january 1826 and
then made his way to the wâdy ghât intending to go from thence at once
to timbuctoo making a tour of lake jenneh or debbie visiting the
melli country and tracing the niger to its mouth he would then have
retraced his steps as far as sackatoo visited lake tchad and attempted
to reach the hill

outside ghât the caravan with which laing was travelling was attacked
some say by tuaricks others by berber arabs a tribe living near the
niger

"laing" says caillié who got his information at timbuctoo "was
recognized as a christian and horribly ill-treated he was beaten with
a stick until he was left for dead i suppose that the other christian
whom they told me was beaten to death was one of the major's servants
the moors of laing's caravan picked him up and succeeded by dint of
great care in recalling him to life so soon as he regained
consciousness he was placed on his camel to which he had to be tied
he was too weak to be able to sit up the robbers had left him nothing
the greater part of his baggage had been rifled"

laing arrived at timbuctoo on the 18th august 1826 and recovered from
his wounds his convalescence was slow but he was fortunately spared
the extortions of the natives owing to the letters of introduction he
had brought with him from tripoli and to the sedulous care of his host
a native of that city

according to caillié who quotes this remarkable fact from an old
native laing retained his european costume and gave out that he had
been sent by his master the king of england to visit timbuctoo and
describe the wonders it contained

"it appears" adds the french traveller "that laing drew the plan of
the city in public for the same moor told me in his naive and
expressive language that he had 'written the town and everything in
it'"

after a careful examination of timbuctoo laing who had good reason to
fear the tuaricks paid a visit by night to cabra and looked down on
the waters of the niger instead of returning to europe by way of the
great desert he was very anxious to go past jenneh and sego to the
french settlements in senegal but at the first hint of his purpose to
the foulahs who crowded to stare at him he was told that a nazarene
could not possibly be allowed to set foot in their country and that if
he dared attempt it they would make him repent it

laing was therefore driven to go by way of el arawan where he hoped
to join a caravan of moorish merchants taking salt to sansanding but
five days after he left timbuctoo his caravan was joined by a fanatic
sheikh named hamed-ould-habib chief of the zawat tribe and laing was
at once arrested under pretence of his having entered their country
without authorization the major being urged to profess mohammedanism
refused preferring death to apostasy a discussion then took place
between the sheikh and his hired assassins as to how the victim should
be put to death and finally laing was strangled by two slaves his
body was left unburied in the desert

this was all caillié was able to find out when he visited timbuctoo but
one year after major laing's death we have supplemented his accounts
by a few details gathered from the reports of the royal geographical
society for the traveller's journal and the notes he took are alike
lost to us

we have already told how laing managed to fix pretty accurately the
position of the sources of the niger we have also described the
efforts made by mungo park and clapperton to trace the middle portion
of the course of that river we have now to narrate the journeys made
in order to examine its mouth and the lower part of its course the
earliest and most successful was that of richard lander formerly
clapperton's servant

richard lander and his brother john proposed to the english government
that they should be sent to explore the niger to its mouth their offer
was accepted and they embarked on a government vessel for badagry
where they arrived on the 19th march 1830

the king of the country adooley of whom richard lander retained a
friendly remembrance was in low spirits his town had just been burnt
his generals and his best soldiers had perished in a battle with the
people of lagos and he himself had had a narrow escape when his house
and all his treasures were destroyed by fire

he determined to retrieve his losses and to do so at the expense of
the travellers who could not get permission to penetrate into the
interior of the country until they had been robbed of their most
valuable merchandise and compelled to sign drafts in payment for a
gun-boat with a hundred men for two puncheons of rum twenty barrels
of powder and a large quantity of merchandise which they knew
perfectly well would never be delivered by this monarch who was as
greedy of gain as he was drunken as a matter of course the natives
followed the example of their chief vied with him in selfishness
greed and meanness regarded the english as fair spoil and fleeced
them on every opportunity

at last on the 31st march richard and john lander succeeded in
getting away from badagry and preceded by an escort sent in advance by
the king arrived at katunga on the 13th may having halted by the way
at wow-wow a good-sized town bidjie where pearce and morrison had
been taken ill jenneh chow egga all towns visited by clapperton
engua where pearce died asinara the first walled city they saw
bohou formerly capital of yariba jaguta leoguadda and itcho where
there is a famous market

[illustration lower course of the niger (after lander)]

at katunga according to custom the travellers halted under a tree
before they were received by the king but being tired of waiting they
presently went to the residence of ebo the chief eunuch and the most
influential man about the person of the sovereign a diabolical noise
of cymbals trumpets and drums all played together announced the
approach of the white men and mansolah the king gave them a most
hearty welcome ordering ebo to behead every one who should molest
them

the landers fearful of being detained by mansolah until the rainy
season acted on ebo's advice and said nothing about the niger but
merely spoke of the death of their fellow-countryman at boussa twenty
years before adding that the king of england had sent them to the
sultan of yaourie to recover his papers

although mansolah did not treat the brothers lander quite as graciously
as he had treated clapperton he allowed them to go eight days after
their arrival

of the many details given in the original account of the landers'
journey of katunga and the province of yariba we will only quote the
following 

"katunga has by no means answered the expectations we had been led to
form of it either as regards its prosperity or the number of its
inhabitants the vast plain on which it stands although exceedingly
fine yields in verdure and fertility and simple beauty of appearance
to the delightful country surrounding the less celebrated city of
bohoo its market is tolerably well supplied with provisions which
are however exceedingly dear insomuch that with the exception of
disgusting insects reptiles and vermin the lower classes of the
people are almost unacquainted with the taste of animal food"

mansolah's carelessness and the imbecile cowardice of his subjects had
enabled the fellatahs to establish themselves in yarriba to entrench
themselves in its fortified towns and to obtain the recognition of
their independence until they became sufficiently strong to assume an
absolute sovereignty over the whole country

from katunga the landers travelled to borghoo by way of atoupa
bumbum a town much frequented by the merchants of houssa borghoo and
other provinces trading with gonja kishi on the frontiers of yarriba
and moussa on the river of the same name beyond which they were met
by an escort sent to join them by the sultan of borghoo sultan yarro
received them with many expressions of pleasure and kindness showing
special delight at seeing richard lander again although he was a
convert to mohammedanism yarro evidently put more faith in the
superstitions of his forefathers than in his new creed fetiches and
gri-gris were hung over his door and in one of his huts there was a
square stool supported on two sides by four little wooden effigies of
men the character manners and costumes of the people of borghoo
differ essentially from those of the natives of yarriba

"perhaps no two people in the universe residing so near each other"
says the narrative "differ more widely  than the natives of yarriba
and borghoo the former are perpetually engaged in trading with each
other from town to town the latter never quit their towns except in
case of war or when engaged in predatory excursions the former are
pusillanimous and cowardly the latter are bold and courageous full of
spirit and energy and never seem happier than when engaged in martial
exercises the former are generally mild unassuming humble and
honest but cold and passionless the latter are proud and haughty too
vain to be civil and too shrewd to be honest yet they appear to
understand somewhat of the nature of love and the social affections
are warm in their attachments and keen in their resentments"

on the 17th june our travellers at last came in sight of the city of
boussa great was their surprise at finding that town on the mainland
and not as clapperton had said on an island in the niger they
entered boussa by the western gate and were almost immediately
introduced to the presence of the king and of the midiki or queen who
told them that they had both that very morning shed tears over the fate
of clapperton

the niger or quorra which flows below the city was the first object
of interest visited by the brothers

"this morning" writes the traveller "we visited the far-famed niger
or quorra which flows by the city about a mile from our residence
and were greatly disappointed at the appearance of this celebrated
river bleak rugged rocks rose abruptly from the centre of the stream
causing strong ripples and eddies on its surface it is said that a
few miles above boussa the river is divided into three branches by two
small fertile islands and that it flows from hence in one continued
stream to funda the niger here in its widest part is not more than a
stone's-throw across at present the rock on which we sat overlooks the
spot where mr park and his associates met their unhappy fate"

richard lander made his preliminary inquiries respecting the books and
papers belonging to mungo park's expedition with great caution but
presently reassured by the sultan's kindness he determined to
question him as to the fate of the explorer yarro was however too
young at the time of the catastrophe to be able to remember what had
occurred it had taken place two reigns back but he promised to have a
search instituted for relics of the illustrious traveller

"in the afternoon" says richard lander "the king came to see us
followed by a man with a book under his arm which was said to have
been picked up in the niger after the loss of our countryman it was
enveloped in a large cotton cloth and our hearts beat high with
expectation as the man was slowly unfolding it for by its size we
guessed it to be mr park's journal but our disappointment and chagrin
were great when on opening the book we discovered it to be an old
nautical publication of the last century"

there was then no further hope of recovering park's journal

on the 23rd june the landers left boussa filled with gratitude to the
king who had given them valuable presents and warned them to accept
no food lest it should be poisoned from any but the governors of the
places they should pass through they travelled alongside of the niger
as far as kagogie where they embarked in a wretched native canoe
whilst their horses were sent on by land to yaoorie

"we had proceeded only a few hundred yards" says richard lander "when
the river gradually widened to two miles and continued as far as the
eye could reach it looked very much like an artificial canal the
steep banks confining the water like low walls with vegetation beyond
in most places the water was extremely shallow but in others it was
deep enough to float a frigate during the first two hours of the day
the scenery was as interesting and picturesque as can be imagined the
banks were literally covered with hamlets and villages fine trees
bending under the weight of their dark and impenetrable foliage
everywhere relieved the eye from the glare of the sun's rays and
contrasted with the lively verdure of the little hills and plains
produced the most pleasing effect all of a sudden came a total change
of scene to the banks of dark earth clay or sand succeeded black
rugged rocks and that wide mirror which reflected the skies was
divided into a thousand little channels by great sand-banks"

a little further on the stream was barred by a wall of black rocks
with a single narrow opening through which its waters rushed furiously
down at this place there is a portage above which the niger flows on
restored to its former breadth repose and grandeur

after three days' navigation the landers reached a village where they
found horses and men waiting for them and whence they quickly made
their way through a continuously hilly country to the town of
yaoorie where they were welcomed by the sultan a stout dirty
slovenly man who received them in a kind of farm-yard cleanly kept
the sultan who was disappointed that clapperton had not visited him
and that richard lander had omitted to pay his respects on his return
journey was very exacting to his present guests he would give them
none of the provisions they wanted and did all he could to detain them
as long as possible

we may add that food was very dear at yaoorie and that richard lander
had no merchandise for barter except a quantity of "whitechapel sharps
warranted not to cut in the eye" for the very good reason he tells
us that most of them had no eyes at all so that they were all but
worthless

they were able however to turn to account some empty tins which had
contained soups the labels although dirty and tarnished were much
admired by the natives one of whom strutted proudly about for some
days wearing an empty tin on his head bearing four labels of
"concentrated essence of meat"

the sultan would not permit the englishmen to enter nyffé or bornou
and told them there was nothing for them but to go back to boussa
richard lander at once wrote to the king of that town asking
permission to buy a canoe in which to go to funda as the road by land
was infested by plundering fellatahs

at last on the 26th july a messenger arrived from the king of boussa
to inquire into the strange conduct of the sultan of yaoorie and the
cause of his detention of the white men after an imprisonment of five
weeks the landers were at last allowed to leave yaoorie which was now
almost entirely inundated

the explorers now ascended the niger to the confluence of the cubbie
and then went down it again to boussa where the king who was glad to
see them again received them with the utmost cordiality they were
however detained longer than they liked by the necessity of paying a
visit to the king of wow-wow as well as by the difficulty of getting a
boat moreover there was some delay in the return of the messengers
who had been sent by the king of boussa to the different chiefs on the
banks of the river and lastly beken rouah (the dark water) had to be
consulted in order to ensure the safety of the travellers in their
journey to the sea

on taking leave of the king the brothers were at a loss to express
their gratitude for his kindness and hospitality his zeal in their
cause and the protection he was ever ready to extend during their stay
of nearly two months in his capital the natives showed great regret at
losing their visitors and knelt in the path of the brothers praying
with uplifted hands to their gods on their behalf

now began the descent of the niger a halt had to be made at the island
of melalie whose chief begged the white men to accept a very fine kid
we may be sure they were too polite to refuse it the landers next
passed the large town of congi the songa of clapperton and then
inguazilligie the rendezvous of merchants travelling between nouffe
and the districts north-east of borghoo below inguazilligie they
halted at patashie a large fertile island of great beauty planted
with palm groves and magnificent trees

as this place was not far from wow-wow richard lander sent a message
to the king of that town who however declined to deliver the canoe
which had been purchased of him the messenger failing in his purpose
the brothers were compelled themselves to visit the king but as they
expected they got only evasive answers they had now no choice if
they wished to continue their journey but to make off with the canoes
which had been lent them at patashie on the 4th october after further
delays they resumed their course and being carried down by the
current were soon out of sight of lever or layaba and its wretched
inhabitants

the first town the brothers came to was bajiebo a large and spacious
city which for dirt noise and confusion could not be surpassed
next came leechee inhabited by nouffe people and the island of madje
where the niger divides into three parts just beyond the travellers
suddenly found themselves opposite a remarkable rock two hundred and
eighty feet high called mount kesa which rises perpendicularly from
the centre of the stream this rock is greatly venerated by the
natives who believe it to be the favourite home of a beneficent
genius

[illustration mount kesa (fac-simile of early engraving)]

at belee a little above rabba the brothers received a visit from the
"king of the dark waters" chief of the island of zagoshi who appeared
in a canoe of great length and unusual cleanliness decked with scarlet
cloth and gold lace on the same day they reached the town of zagoshi
opposite rabba and the second fellatah town beyond sackatoo

mallam dendo chief of zagoshi was a cousin of bello he was a blind
and very feeble old man in very bad health who knew he had but a few
years longer to reign and his one thought was how best to secure the
throne to his son

although he had received very costly presents mallam dendo was
anything but satisfied and declared that if the travellers did not
make him other and more valuable gifts he would require their guns
pistols and powder before he allowed them to leave zagoshi

richard lander did not know what to do when the gift of the tobé (or
robe) of mungo park which had been restored by the king of boussa
threw mallam dendo into such ecstasies of joy that he declared himself
the protector of the europeans promised to do all he could to help
them to reach the sea made them a present of several richly-coloured
plaited mats two bags of rice and a bunch of bananas these stores
came just in time for the whole stock of cloth looking-glasses
razors and pipes was exhausted and the english had nothing left but a
few needles and some silver bracelets as presents for the chiefs on the
banks of the niger

"rabba" says lander " seen from zagoshi appears to be a large
compact clean and well-built town though it is unwalled and is not
otherwise fenced it is irregularly built on the slope of a
gently-rising hill at the foot of which runs the niger and in point
of rank population and wealth it is the second city in the fellatah
dominions sackatoo alone being considered as its superior it is
inhabited by a mixed population of fellatahs nyffeans and emigrants
and slaves from various countries and is governed by a ruler who
exercises sovereign authority over rabba and its dependencies and is
styled sultan or king rabba is famous for milk oil and honey the
market when our messengers were there appeared to be well supplied
with bullocks horses mules asses sheep goats and abundance of
poultry rice and various sorts of corn cotton cloth indigo saddles
and bridles made of red and yellow leather besides shoes boots and
sandals were offered for sale in great plenty although we observed
about two hundred slaves for sale none had been disposed of when we
left the market in the evening rabba is not very famous for the
number or variety of its artificers and yet in the manufacture of mats
and sandals it is unrivalled however in all other handicrafts rabba
yields to zagoshi"

the industry and love of labour displayed by the people of the latter
town were an agreeable surprise in this lazy country its inhabitants
who are hospitable and obliging are protected by the situation of
their island against the fellatahs they are independent too and
recognize no authority but that of the "king of the dark waters" whom
they obey because it is to their interest to do so

on the 16th october the landers at last started in a wretched canoe
for which the king had made them pay a high price with paddles they
had stolen because no one would sell them any this was the first time
they had been able to embark on the niger without help from the
natives they went down the river whose width varies greatly avoiding
large towns as much as possible for they had no means of satisfying
the extortions of the chiefs no incident of note occurred before egga
was reached if we except a terrible storm which overtook the
travellers when unable to land in the marshes bordering the river
they had allowed their boat to drift with the current and during which
they were all but upset by the hippopotami playing about on the surface
of the water all this time the niger flowed in an ese direction
now eight now only two miles in width the current was so rapid that
the boat went at the rate of four or five miles an hour

[illustration "they were all but upset"]

on the 19th october the landers passed the mouth of the coudonia which
richard had crossed near cuttup on his first expedition and a little
later they came in sight of egga the landing-place was soon reached by
way of a bay encumbered with an immense number of large and heavy
canoes full of merchandise with the prows daubed with blood and
covered with feathers as charms against thieves

the chief to whom the travellers were at once conducted was an old
man with a long white beard whose appearance would have been venerable
and patriarchal had he not laughed and played in quite a childish
manner the natives assembled in hundreds to see the strange-looking
visitors and the latter had to place three men as sentinels outside
their door to keep the curious at a distance

[illustration square stool belonging to the king of bornou
(fac-simile of early engraving)]

lander says that benin and portuguese cloths are sold at egga by many
of its inhabitants so that it would appear that some kind of
communication is kept up between the sea-coast and this place the
people are very speculative and enterprising and numbers of them
employ all their time solely in trading up and down the niger they
live entirely in their canoes over which they have a shed that
answers completely every purpose for which it is intended so that in
their constant peregrinations they have no need of any other dwelling
or shelter than that which their canoes afford them

"their belief" says lander "that we possessed the power of doing
anything we wished was at first amusing enough but their
importunities went so far that they became annoying they applied to us
for charms to avert wars and other national calamities to make them
rich to prevent the crocodiles from carrying off the people and for
the chief of the fishermen to catch a canoe-load of fish every day
each request being accompanied with some sort of present such as
country beer goora-nuts cocoa-nuts lemons yams rice &c in
quantity proportionate to the value of their request

"the curiosity of the people to see us is so intense that we dare not
stir out of doors and therefore we are compelled to keep our door open
all day long for the benefit of the air and the only exercise which we
can take is by walking round and round our hut like wild beasts in a
cage the people stand gazing at us with visible emotions of amazement
and terror we are regarded in fact in just the same light as the
fiercest tigers in europe if we venture to approach too near the
doorway they rush backwards in a state of the greatest alarm and
trepidation but when we are at the opposite side of the hut they draw
as near as their fears will permit them in silence and caution

"egga is a town of vast extent and its population must be immense
like all the towns on the banks of the niger it is inundated every
year we can but conclude that the natives have their own reasons for
building their houses in situations which in our eyes are alike so
inconvenient and unhealthy perhaps it may be because the soil of the
surrounding districts consists of a black greasy mould of extraordinary
fertility supplying all the necessaries of life at the cost of very
little trouble although the king of egga looked more than a hundred
years old he was very gay and light-hearted the chief people of the
town met in his hut and spent whole days in conversation this company
of greybeards for they are all old laugh so heartily at the
sprightliness of their own wit that it is an invariable practice when
any one passes by to stop and listen outside and they add to their
noisy merriment so much good-will that we hear nothing from the hut in
which the aged group are revelling during the day but loud peals of
laughter and shouts of applause"

one day the old chief wished to show off his accomplishments of singing
and dancing expecting to astonish his visitors

"he frisked" says lander "beneath the burden of five-score and
shaking his hoary locks capered over the ground to the manifest
delight of the bystanders whose plaudits though confined as they
always are to laughter yet tickled the old man's fancy to that
degree that he was unable to keep up his dance any longer without the
aid of a crutch with its assistance he hobbled on a little while but
his strength failed him he was constrained for the time to give over
and he set himself down at our side on the threshold of the hut he
would not acknowledge his weakness to us for the world but endeavoured
to pant silently and suppress loud breathings that we might not hear
him how ridiculous yet how natural is this vanity he made other
unavailing attempts to dance and also made an attempt to sing but
nature would not second his efforts and his weak piping voice was
scarcely audible the singers dancers and musicians continued their
noisy mirth till we were weary of looking at and listening to them
and as bedtime was drawing near we desired them to depart to the
infinite regret of the frivolous but merry old chief"

mallam-dendo however tried to dissuade the english from continuing
the descent of the river egga he said was the last nouffe town the
power of the fellatahs extended no further and between it and the sea
dwelt none but savage and barbarous races always at war with each
other these rumours and the stories told by the natives to the
landers' people of the danger they would run of being murdered or sold
as slaves so terrified the latter that they refused to embark
declaring their intention of going back to cape coast castle by the way
that they came thanks to the firmness of the brothers this mutiny was
quelled and on the 22nd october the explorers left egga firing a
parting salute of three musket-shots a few miles further down a
sea-gull flew over their heads a sure sign that they were approaching
the sea and with it it appeared all but certain the end of their
wearisome journey

several small and wretched villages half under water and a large town
at the foot of a mountain which looked ready to overwhelm it the name
of which the travellers could not learn were passed in succession
they met a great number of canoes built like those on the bonny and
calabar rivers the crews stared in astonishment at the white men whom
they dared not address the low marshy banks of the niger were now
gradually exchanged for loftier richer and more fertile districts

kacunda where the people of egga had recommended lander to halt is on
the western bank of the river from a distance its appearance is
singularly picturesque the natives were at first alarmed at the
appearance of the travellers an old mallam acting as mohammedan priest
and schoolmaster took them under his protection and thanks to him
the brothers received a warm welcome in the capital of the independent
kingdom of nouffé the information collected in this town or rather in
this group of four villages coincided with that obtained at egga
richard lander therefore resolved to make the rest of the voyage by
night and to load his four remaining guns and two pistols with balls
and shot to the great astonishment of the natives who could not
understand such contempt of danger the explorers left kacunda with
three loud cheers committing their cause to the hands of god they
passed several important towns which they avoided the river now wound
a great deal flowing from the south to south-east and then to the
south-west between lofty hills

on the 25th october the english found themselves opposite the mouth of
a large river it was the tchadda or benuwe at its junction with the
niger is an important town called cutum curaffi after a narrow escape
from being swallowed up in a whirlpool and crushed against the rocks
lander having found a suitable spot showing signs of habitation
determined to land that this place had been visited a little time
previously was proved by two burnt out fires with some broken
calabashes fragments of earthenware vessels cocoa-nut shells staves
of powder-barrels &c which the travellers picked up with some
emotion for they proved that the natives had had dealings with
europeans some women ran away out of a village which three of lander's
men entered with a view to get the materials for a fire the exhausted
explorers were resting on mats when they were suddenly surrounded by a
crowd of half-naked men armed with guns bows and arrows cutlasses
iron barbs and spears the coolness and presence of mind of the
brothers alone averted a struggle the issue of which could not be
dubious "as we approached" says lander "we made all the signs and
motions we could with our arms to deter the chief and his people from
firing on us his quiver was dangling at his side his bow was bent
and an arrow which was pointed at our breasts already trembled on the
string when we were within a few yards of his person this was a
highly critical moment the next might be our last but the hand of
providence averted the blow for just as the chief was about to pull
the fatal cord a man that was nearest him rushed forward and stayed
his arm at that instant we stood before him and immediately held
forth our hands all of them trembled like aspen leaves the chief
looked up full in our faces kneeling on the ground light seemed to
flash from his dark rolling eyes his body was convulsed all over as
though he were enduring the utmost torture and with a timorous yet
undefinable expression of countenance in which all the passions of our
nature were strangely blended he drooped his head eagerly grasped our
proffered hands and burst into tears this was a sign of friendship
harmony followed and war and bloodshed were thought of no more it was
happy for us that our white faces and calm behaviour produced the
effect it did on these people in another minute our bodies would have
been as full of arrows as a porcupine's is full of quills 'i thought
you were children of heaven fallen from the skies' said the chief in
explanation of this sudden change"

this scene took place in the famous market-town of bocqua of which the
travellers had so often heard whither the people come up from the
coast to exchange the merchandise of the whites for slaves brought in
large numbers from funda on the opposite bank

the information obtained at bocqua was most satisfactory the sea was
only ten days' journey off there was no danger in going down the
river the chief said though the people on the banks were a bad lot

following the advice of this chief the travellers passed the fine town
of atta without stopping and halted at abbagaca where the river
divides into several branches and whose chief showed insatiable greed
refusing to halt at several villages whose inhabitants begged for a
sight of the white strangers they were finally obliged to land at the
village of damuggo where a little man wearing a waistcoat which had
once formed part of a uniform hailed them in english crying out
"halloa ho you english come here" he was an emissary from the king
of bonny come to buy slaves for the master

the chief of damuggo who had never before seen white men received the
explorers very kindly held public rejoicings in their honour and
detained them with constant fêtes until the 4th november although the
fetich consulted by him presaged that they would meet with a thousand
dangers before reaching the sea this monarch supplied them with an
extra canoe some rowers and a guide

[illustration map of the lower course of the djoliba kouara quoora
or niger (after lander) gravé par e morieu]

the sinister predictions of the fetich were soon fulfilled john and
richard lander were embarked in different boats as they passed a large
town called kirree they were stopped by war-canoes each containing
forty men wearing european clothes minus the trousers

each canoe carried what at first sight appeared to be the union jack
flying from a long bamboo cane fixed in the stern a four or six
pounder was lashed to each prow and every black sailor was provided
with a musket

the two brothers were taken to kirree where a palaver was held upon
their fate fortunately the mallams or mohammedan priests interfered in
their favour and some of their property was restored to them but the
best part had gone to the bottom of the river with john lander's canoe

"to my great satisfaction" says lander "i immediately recognized the
box containing our books and one of my brother's journals the
medicine-chest was by its side but both were filled with water a
large carpet bag containing all our wearing apparel was lying cut
open and deprived of its contents with the exception of a shirt a
pair of trousers and a waistcoat many valuable articles which it had
contained were gone the whole of my journal with the exception of a
note-book with remarks from rabba to this place was lost four guns
one of which had been the property of the late mr park four
cutlasses and two pistols were gone nine elephants' tusks the
finest i had seen in the country which had been given us by the kings
of wow-wow and boussa a quantity of ostrich feathers some handsome
leopard skins a great variety of seeds all our buttons cowries and
needles which were necessary for us to purchase provisions with all
were missing and said to have been sunk in the river"

this was like going down in port after crossing africa from badagry to
boussa escaping all the dangers of navigating the niger getting free
from the hands of so many rapacious chiefs to be shipwrecked six day's
journey from the sea to be made slaves of or condemned to death just
on the eve of making known to europe the results of so many sufferings
endured so many dangers escaped so many obstacles happily surmounted
to have traced the course of the niger from boussa to be on the point
of determining the exact position of its mouth and then to find
themselves stopped by wretched pirates was really too much and bitter
indeed were the reflections of the brothers during the interminable
palaver upon their fate

although their stolen property was partially restored to them and the
negro who had begun the attack upon them was condemned to be beheaded
the brothers were none the less regarded as prisoners and they were
marched off to obie king of the country who would decide what was to
be done with them it was evident that the robbers were not natives of
the country but had only entered it with a view to pillage they
probably counted on trading in two or three such market-towns as kirree
if they did not meet with any boats but such as were too strong to be
plundered for the rest all the tribes of this part of the niger
seemed to be at daggers drawn with each other and the trade in
provisions was carried on under arms after two days' row the canoes
came in sight of eboe at a spot where the stream divides into three
"rivers" of great width with marshy level banks covered with
palm-trees an hour later one of the boatmen a native of eboe cried
"there is my country" here fresh difficulties awaited the travellers
obie king of eboe a young man with a refined and intelligent
countenance received the white men with cordiality his dress which
reminded his visitors of that of the king of yarriba was adorned with
such a quantity of coral that he might have been called the coral king

obie seemed to be affected by the account the english gave of the
struggle in which they had lost all their merchandise but the aid he
gave them was by no means proportioned to the warmth of the sentiments
which he expressed indeed he let them all but die of hunger

"the eboe people" says the narrative "like most africans are
extremely indolent and cultivate yams indian corn and plantains
only they have abundance of goats and fowls but few sheep are to be
seen and no bullocks the city which has no other name than the eboe
country is situated on an open plain it is immensely large contains
a vast population and is the capital of a kingdom of the same name it
has for a series of years been the principal slave-mart for native
traders from the coast between the bonny and old calabar rivers and
for the production of its palm-oil it has obtained equal celebrity
hundreds of men from the rivers mentioned above come up for the purpose
of trade and numbers of them are at present residing in canoes in
front of the town most of the oil purchased by englishmen at the bonny
and adjacent rivers is brought from thence as are nearly all the
slaves which are annually exported from those places by the french
spaniards and portuguese it has been told us by many that the eboe
people are confirmed anthropophagi and this opinion is more prevalent
among the tribes bordering on that kingdom than with the natives of
more remote districts"

from what the travellers could learn it was pretty certain that obie
would not let them go without exacting a considerable ransom he may
doubtless have been driven to this by the importunity of his
favourites but it was more likely the result of the greed of the
people of bonny and brass who quarrelled as to which tribe should
carry off the english to their country

a son of the chief of bonny king pepper a native named gun brother
of king boy and their father king forday who with king jacket govern
the whole of the brass country were the most eager in their demands
and produced as proofs of their honourable intentions the testimonials
given to them by the european captains with whom they had business
relations

one of these documents signed james dow captain of the brig "susan"
of liverpool and dated from the most important river of the brass
country september 1830 ran thus 

"captain dow states that he never met with a set of greater scoundrels
than the natives generally and the pilots in particular"

it goes on in a similar strain heaping curses upon the natives and
charging them with having endeavoured to wreck dow's vessel at the
mouth of the river with a view to dividing his property amongst them
king jacket was designated as an arrant rogue and a desperate thief
boy was the only one of common honesty or trustworthiness

after an endless palaver obie declared that according to the laws and
customs of the country he had a right to look upon the landers and
their people as his property but that not wishing to abuse his
privileges he would set them free in exchange for the value of twenty
slaves in english merchandise this decision which richard lander
tried in vain to shake plunged the brothers into the depths of
despair a state of mind soon succeeded by an apathy and indifference
so complete that they could not have made the faintest effort to
recover their liberty add to these mental sufferings the physical
weakness to which they were reduced by want of food and we shall have
some idea of their state of prostration without resources of any kind
robbed of their needles cowries and merchandise they were reduced to
the sad necessity of begging their bread "but we might as well have
addressed our petitions to the stones or trees" says lander "we might
have spared ourselves the mortification of a refusal we never
experienced a more stinging sense of our own humbleness and imbecility
than on such occasions and never had we greater need of patience and
lowliness of spirit in most african towns and villages we have been
regarded as demigods and treated in consequence with universal
kindness civility and veneration but here alas what a contrast we
are classed with the most degraded and despicable of mankind and are
become slaves in a land of ignorance and barbarism whose savage
natives have treated us with brutality and contempt"

it was boy who finally achieved the rescue of the landers for he
consented to pay to obie the ransom he demanded for them and their
people boy himself was very moderate asking for nothing in return for
his trouble and the risk he ran in taking the white men to brass but
fifteen bars or fifteen slaves and a barrel of rum although this
demand was exorbitant lander did not hesitate to write an order on
richard lake captain of an english vessel at anchor in brass river
for thirty-six bars

the king's canoe on which the brothers embarked on the 12th november
carried sixty persons forty of whom were rowers it was hollowed out
of a single tree-trunk measured more than fifty feet long carried a
four-pounder in the prow an arsenal of cutlasses and grape-shot and
was laden with merchandise of every kind the vast tracts of cultivated
land on either side of the river showed that the population was far
more numerous than would have been supposed the scenery was flat
open and varied and the soil a rich black mould produced luxuriant
trees and green shrubs of every shade at seven pm on the 11th
november the canoe left the chief branch of the niger and entered the
brass river an hour later richard lander recognized with
inexpressible delight tidal waves

[illustration "it was hollowed out of a single tree-trunk"]

a little farther on boy's canoe came up with those of gun and forday
the latter was a venerable-looking old man in spite of his wretched
semi-european semi-native clothing and a very strong predilection for
rum of which he consumed a great quantity although his manners and
conversation betrayed no signs of excessive drinking

that was a strange escort which accompanied the two englishmen as far
as the town of brass

"the canoes" says lander "were following each other up the river in
tolerable order each of them displaying three flags in the first was
king boy standing erect and conspicuous his headdress of feathers
waving with the movements of his body which had been chalked in
various fantastic figures rendered more distinct by its natural
colour his hands were resting on the barbs of two immense spears
which at intervals he darted violently into the bottom of the canoe as
if he were in the act of killing some formidable wild animal under his
feet in the bows of all the other canoes fetish priests were dancing
and performing various extraordinary antics their persons as well as
those of the people with them being chalked over in the same manner as
that of king boy and to crown the whole mr gun the little military
gentleman was most actively employed his canoe now darting before and
now dropping behind the rest adding not a little to the imposing
effect of the whole scene by the repeated discharges of his cannon"

brass consists of two towns one belonging to forday the other to king
jacket the priests performed some curious ceremonies before
disembarking evidently having reference to the whites was the result
of the consultation of the fetish of the town favourable or not to the
visitors? the way the natives treated them would answer that question
before he set foot on land richard lander to his great delight
recognized a white man on the banks he was the captain of a spanish
schooner at anchor in the river the narrative goes on to say 

"of all the wretched filthy and contemptible places in this world of
ours none can present to the eye of a stranger so miserable an
appearance or can offer such disgusting and loathsome sights as this
abominable brass town dogs goats and other animals run about the
dirty streets half-starved whose hungry looks can only be exceeded by
the famishing appearance of the men women and children which
bespeaks the penury and wretchedness to which they are reduced whilst
the persons of many of them are covered with odious boils and their
huts are falling to the ground from neglect and decay"

another place called pilot town by the europeans on account of the
number of pilots living in it is situated at the mouth of the river
nun seventy miles from brass king forday demanded four bars before
the landers left the town saying it was customary for every white man
who came to brass by the river to make that payment it was impossible
to evade compliance and lander drew another bill on captain lake at
this price richard lander obtained permission to go down in boy's royal
canoe to the english brig stationed at the mouth of the river his
brother and his servants were not to be set free until the return of
the king on his arrival on the brig lander's astonishment and shame
was extreme when he found that lake refused to give him any help
whatever the instructions given to the brothers from the ministry were
read to prove that he was not an impostor but the captain answered 

"if you think that you have a    fool to deal with you are mistaken
i'll not give a    flint for your bill i would not give a    for
it"

overwhelmed with grief at such unexpected behaviour from a
fellow-countryman richard lander returned to boy's canoe not knowing
to whom to apply and asked his escort to take him to bonny where
there were a number of english vessels the king refused to do this
and the explorer was obliged to try once more to move the captain
begging him to give him at least ten muskets which might possibly
satisfy forday

"i have told you already" answered lake "that i will not let you have
even a flint so bother me no more"

"but i have a brother and eight people at brass town" rejoined lander
"and if you do not intend to pay king boy at least persuade him to
bring them here or else he will poison or starve my brother before i
can get any assistance from a man-of-war and sell all my people"

"if you can get them on board" replied the captain "i will take them
away but as i have told you before you do not get a flint from me"

at last lander persuaded boy to go back and fetch his brother and his
people the king at first declined to do so without receiving some
payment on account and it was only with difficulty that he was induced
to forego this demand when lake found out that lander's servants were
able-bodied men who could replace the sailors he had lost by death or
who were down with fever he relented a little this yielding mood did
not however last long for he declared that if john and his people
did not come in three days he would start without them in vain did
richard prove to him beyond a doubt that if he did so the white men
would be sold as slaves the captain would not listen to him only
answering "i can't help it i shall wait no longer" such inhumanity
as this is fortunately very rare and a wretch who could thus insult
those not merely his equals but so much his superiors ought to be
pilloried at last on the 24th november after weathering a strong
breeze which made the passage of the bar very rough and all but
impossible john lander arrived on board he had had to bear a good
many reproaches from boy for whom it must be confessed there was
some excuse for had he not at his own cost rescued the brothers and
their people from slavery brought them down in his own canoe and fed
them although very badly all on the strength of their promise to pay
him with as much beef and rum as he could consume? whereas he was
after all roughly received by lake told that his advances would never
be refunded and treated as a thief certainly he had cause to complain
and any one else would have made his prisoners pay dearly for the
disappointment of so many hopes and the loss of so much money

for all this however boy brought john lander safely to the brig
captain lake received the traveller pretty cordially but declared his
intention of making the king go back without so much as an obolus poor
boy was full of the most gloomy forebodings his haughty manner was
exchanged for an air of deprecating humility an abundant meal was
placed before him but he scarcely touched it richard lander
disgusted with the stinginess and bad faith of lake and unable to keep
his promises ransacked all his possessions and finding at last five
silver bracelets and a sabre of native manufacture which he had
brought from yarriba he offered these to boy who accepted them
finally the king screwed up courage enough to make his demand to the
captain who in a voice of thunder which it was difficult to believe
could have come from such a feeble body declined to accede to it
enforcing his refusal with a shower of oaths and threats such as made
boy who saw moreover that the vessel was ready to sail beat a hasty
retreat and hurry off to his canoe

thus ended the vicissitudes of the brothers lander's journey they were
in some danger in crossing the bar but that was their last they
reached fernando po and then the calabar river where they embarked on
the carnarvon for rio janeiro at which port admiral baker then
commanding the station got them a passage on board a transport-ship

on the 9th june they disembarked at portsmouth their first care after
sending an account of their journey to lord goderich then colonial
secretary was to inform that official of the conduct of captain lake
conduct which was of a nature to compromise the credit of the english
government orders were at once given by the minister for the payment
of the sums agreed upon which were perfectly just and reasonable

thus was completely and finally solved the geographical problem which
had for so many centuries occupied the attention of the civilized
world and been the subject of so many different conjectures the
niger or as the natives call it the joliba or quorra is not
connected with the nile and does not lose itself in the desert sands
or in the waters of lake tchad it flows in a number of different
branches into the ocean on the coast of the gulf of guinea at the
point known as cape formosa the entire glory of this discovery
foreseen though it was by scientific men belongs to the brothers
lander the vast extent of country traversed by the niger between
yaoorie and the sea was completely unknown before their journey

so soon as the discoveries made by lander became known in england
several merchants formed themselves into a company for developing the
resources of the new districts in july 1832 they equipped two
steamers the quorra and alburka which under the command of
messrs laird oldfield and richard lander appended the niger as far
as bocqua the results of this commercial expedition were deplorable
not only was there absolutely no trade to be carried on with the
natives but the crews of the vessels were decimated by fever finally
richard lander who had so often gone up and down the river was
mortally wounded by the natives on the 27th january 1834 and died on
the morning of 5th february at fernando po

to complete our account of the exploration of africa during the period
under review we have still to speak of the various surveys of the
valley of the nile the most important of which were those by
cailliaud russegger and rüppell

frederic cailliaud was born at nantes in 1787 and arrived in egypt in
1815 having previously visited holland italy sicily part of greece
and european or asiatic turkey where he traded in precious stones his
knowledge of geology and mineralogy won for him a cordial reception
from mehemet ali who immediately on his arrival commissioned him to
explore the course of the nile and the desert

this first trip resulted in the discovery of emerald mines at labarah
mentioned by arab authors which had been abandoned for centuries in
the excavations in the mountain cailliaud found the lamps crowbars
ropes and tools used in working these mines by men in the employ of
ptolemy near the quarries the traveller discovered the ruins of a
little town which was probably inhabited by the ancient miners to
prove the reality of his valuable discovery he took back ten pounds'
weight of emeralds to mehemet ali

another result of this journey was the discovery by the french explorer
of the old road from coptos to berenice for the trade of india

from september 1819 to the end of 1832 cailliaud accompanied by a
former midshipman named letorzec was occupied in exploring all the
known oases east of egypt and in tracing the nile to 10 degrees n
lat on his first journey he reached wady halfa and for his second
trip he made that place his starting-point a fortunate accident did
much to aid his researches this was the appointment of ismail pacha
son of mehemet ali to the command of an expedition to nubia to this
expedition cailliaud attached himself

leaving daraou in november 1820 cailliaud arrived on the 5th january
in the ensuing year at dongola and reached mount barka in the chaguy
country where are a vast number of ruins of temples pyramids and
other monuments the fact of this district bearing the name of merawe
had given rise to an opinion that in it was situated the ancient
capital of ethiopia cailliaud was enabled to show this to be
erroneous

[illustration view of a merawe temple (fac-simile of early
engraving)]

the french explorer accompanying ismail pacha in the character of a
mineralogist beyond berber on a quest for gold-mines arrived at
shendy he then went with letorzec to determine the position of the
junction of the atbara with the nile and at assour not far from 17
degrees n lat he discovered the ruins of an extensive ancient town
it was meroë pressing on in a southerly direction between the 15th and
16th degrees of n lat cailliaud next identified the mouth of the
bahr-el-abiad or white nile visited the ruins of saba the mouth of
the rahad the ancient astosaba sennaar the river gologo the fazoele
country and the toumat a tributary of the nile finally reaching the
singue country between the two branches of the river cailliaud was the
first explorer to penetrate from the north so near to the equator
browne had turned back at 16 degrees 10 minutes bruce at 11 degrees
to cailliaud and letorzec we owe many observations on latitude and
longitude some valuable remarks on the variation of the magnetic
needle and details of the climate temperature and nature of the
soil together with a most interesting collection of animals and
botanical specimens lastly the travellers made plans of all the
monuments beyond the second cataract

[illustration the second cataract of the nile]

the two frenchmen had preluded their discoveries by an excursion to the
oasis of siwâh at the end of 1819 they left fayum with a few
companions and entered the libyan desert in fifteen days and after a
brush with the arabs they reached siwâh having on their way taken
measurements of every part of the temple of jupiter ammon and
determined as browne had done its exact geographical position a
little later a military expedition was sent to this same oasis in
which drovetti collected new and very valuable documents supplementing
those obtained by cailliaud and letorzec they afterwards visited
successively the oasis of falafre never before explored by a european
that of dakel and khargh the chief place of the theban oasis the
documents collected on this journey were sent to france to the care of
m jomard who founded on them his work called "voyage à l'oasis de
siouah"

[illustration temple of jupiter ammon]

a few years later edward rüppell devoted seven or eight years to the
exploration of nubia sennaar kordofan and abyssinia in 1824 he
ascended the white nile for more than sixty leagues above its mouth

lastly in 1836 to 1838 joseph russegger superintendent of the
austrian mines visited the lower portion of the course of the
bahr-el-abiad this official journey was followed by the important and
successful surveys afterwards made by order of mehemet ali in the same
regions




chapter iii
the oriental scientific movement and american discoveries

the decipherment of cuneiform inscriptions and the study of assyrian
remains up to 1840 ancient iran and the avesta the survey of india
and the study of hindustani the exploration and measurement of the
himalaya mountains the arabian peninsula syria and palestine central
asia and alexander von humboldt pike at the sources of the
mississippi arkansas and red river major long's two expeditions 
general cass schoolcraft at the sources of the mississippi the
exploration of new mexico archæological expeditions in central
america scientific expeditions in brazil spix and martin prince
maximilian of wied-neuwied d'orbigny and american man


although the discoveries which we are now to relate are not strictly
speaking geographical they nevertheless throw such a new light on
several early civilizations and have done so much to extend the domain
of history and ideas that we are compelled to dedicate a few words to
them

the reading of cuneiform inscriptions and the decipherment of
hieroglyphics are events so important in their results they reveal to
us so vast a number of facts hitherto unknown or distorted in the more
or less marvellous narratives of the ancient historians diodorus
ctesias and herodotus that it is impossible to pass over scientific
discoveries of such value in silence

thanks to them we form an intimate acquaintance with a whole world
with an extremely advanced civilization with manners habits and
customs differing essentially from our own how strange it seems to
hold in our hands the accounts of the steward of some great lord or
governor of a province or to read such romances as those of setna
and the two brothers or stories such as that of the predestined
prince

those buildings of vast proportions those superb temples magnificent
hypogæa and sculptured obelisks were once nothing more to us than
sumptuous monuments but now that the inscriptions upon them have been
read they relate to us the life of the kings who built them and the
circumstances of their erection

how many names of races not mentioned by greek historians how many
towns now lost how many of the smallest details of the religion art
and daily life as well as of the political and military events of the
past are revealed to us by the hieroglyphic and cuneiform
inscriptions

not only do we now see into the daily life of these ancient peoples of
whom we had formerly but a very superficial knowledge but we get an
idea even of their literature the day is perhaps not far distant when
we shall know as much of the life of the egyptians in the eighteenth
century before christ as that of our forefathers in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries of our own era

carsten niebuhr was the first to make and bring to europe an exact and
complete copy of inscriptions at persepolis in an unknown character
many attempts had been made to explain them but all had been vain
until in 1802 grotefend the learned hanoverian philologist succeeded
by an inspiration of genius in solving the mystery in which they were
enveloped

truly these cuneiform characters were strange and difficult to
decipher imagine a collection of nails variously arranged and forming
groups horizontally placed what did these groups signify? did they
represent sounds and articulations or like the letters of our
alphabet complete words? had they the ideographic value of chinese
written characters? what was the language hidden in them? these were
the problems to be solved it appeared probable that the inscriptions
brought from persepolis were written in the language of the ancient
persians but rask bopp and lassen had not yet studied the iranian
idioms and proved their affinity with sanskrit

it would be beyond our province to give an account of the ingenious
deductions the skilful guesses and the patient groping through which
grotefend finally achieved the recognition of an alphabetic system of
writing and succeeded in separating from certain groups of words what
he believed to be the names of darius and xerxes thus attaining a
knowledge of several letters by means of which he made out other
words it is enough for us to say that the key was found by him and to
others was left the task of completing and perfecting his work

more than thirty years passed by however before any notable progress
was made in these studies it was our learned fellow-countryman eugène
burnouf who gave them a decided impulse turning to account his
knowledge of sanskrit and zend he found that the language of the
inscriptions of persepolis was but a zend dialect used in bactriana
which was still spoken in the sixth century bc and in which the
books of zoroaster were written burnouf's pamphlet bears date 1836 at
the same period lassen a german scholar of bonn came to the same
conclusion on the same grounds

the inscriptions already discovered were soon all deciphered and with
the exception of a few signs on the meaning of which scholars were not
quite agreed the entire alphabet became known but the foundations
alone were laid the building was still far from finished the
persepolitan inscriptions appeared to be repeated in three parallel
columns might not this be a triple version of the same inscription in
the three chief languages of the achæmenian empire namely the
persian median and assyrian or babylonian this guess proved correct
and owing to the decipherment of one of the inscriptions a test was
obtained and the same plan was followed as that of champollion with
regard to the rosetta stone on which was the tri-lingual inscription
in greek demotic or enchorial and hieroglyphic characters

in the second and third inscriptions were recognized syro-chaldee
which like hebrew himyaric and arabic belong to the semitic group
and a third idiom to which the name of medic was given resembling the
dialects of the turks and tartars but it would be presumptuous of us
to enlarge upon these researches that was to be the task of the danish
scholar westergaard of the frenchmen de saulcy and oppert and of the
englishmen morris and rawlinson not to mention others less celebrated
we shall have to return to this subject later

the knowledge of sanskrit and the investigation of brahmanic
literature had inaugurated a scientific movement which has gone on
ever since with increasing energy

long before nineveh and babylon were known as nations a vast country
called iran by orientalists which included persia afghanistan and
beloochistan was the scene of an advanced civilization with which is
connected the name of zoroaster who was at once a conqueror a
law-giver and the founder of a religion the disciples of zoroaster
persecuted at the time of the mohammedan conquest and driven from
their ancient home where their mode of worship was still preserved
took refuge under the name of parsees in the north-west of india

at the end of the last century the frenchman aquetil duperron brought
to europe an exact copy of the religious books of the parsees written
in the language of zoroaster he translated them and for sixty years
all the savants had found in them the source of all their religious
and philological notions of iran these books are known under the name
of the zend-avesta a word which comprises the name of the language
zend and the title of the book avesta

as the knowledge of sanskrit increased however that branch of science
required to be studied afresh by the light of the new method in 1826
the danish philologist rask and later eugène burnouf with his
profound knowledge of sanskrit and by the help of a translation in
that language recently discovered in india turned once more to the
study of the zend in 1834 burnouf published a masterly treatise on the
yacna which marked an epoch from the resemblance between the archaic
sanskrit and the zend came the recognition of the common origin of the
two languages and the relationship or rather the identity of the
races who speak them originally the names of the deities the
traditions the generic appellation that of aryan of the two peoples
are the same to say nothing of the similarity of their customs but it
is needless to dwell on the importance of this discovery which has
thrown an entirely new light on the infancy of the human race of which
for so many centuries nothing was known

from the close of the eighteenth century that is to say from the time
when the english first obtained a secure footing in india the physical
study of the country was vigorously carried on outstripping of course
for a time that of the ethnology and kindred subjects which require
for their prosecution a more settled country and less exciting times
it must be owned however that knowledge of the races of the country
to be controlled is as essential to the government as it is to
commercial enterprise and in 1801 lord wellesley as governor for the
company recognizing the importance of securing a good map of the
english territories commissioned brigadier william lambton to
connect by means of a trigonometrical survey the eastern and western
banks of the indus with the observatory of madras lambton was not
content with the mere accomplishment of this task he laid down with
precision one arc of the meridian from cape comorin to the village of
takoor-kera fifteen miles south-east of ellichpoor the amplitude of
this arc exceeded twelve degrees with the aid of competent officers
amongst whom we must mention colonel everest the government of india
would have hailed the completion of the task of its engineers long
before 1840 if the successive annexation of new territories had not
constantly added to the extent of ground to be covered

at about the same time with this progress in our knowledge of the
geography of india an impulse was given to the study of the literature
of india

in 1776 an extract from the most important native codes then for the
first time translated under the title of the code of the gentoos[1] was
published in london nine years later the asiatic society was founded
in calcutta by sir william jones the first who thoroughly mastered the
sanskrit language in "asiatic researches" published by this society
were collected the results of all scientific investigations relating to
india in 1789 jones published his translation of the drama of
s'akuntala that charming specimen of hindu literature so full of
feeling and refinement sanskrit grammars and dictionaries were now
multiplied and a regular rivalry was set on foot in british india
which would undoubtedly soon have spread to europe had not the
continental blockade prevented the introduction of works published
abroad at this time an englishman named hamilton a prisoner of war in
paris studied the oriental mss in the library of the french capital
and taught frederick schlegel the rudiments of sanskrit which it was
no longer necessary to go to india to learn

[footnote 1 gentoo was the name given by old english writers to the
natives of hindustan and is now obsolete having been superseded by
that of hindoo trans]

lassen was schlegel's pupil and together they studied the literature
and antiquities of india examining translating and publishing the
original texts whilst at the same time franz bopp devoted himself to
the study of the language making his grammars accessible to all and
coming to the conclusion which was then startling although it is now
generally accepted of the common origin of the indo-european
languages

it was proved that the vedas that collection of sacred writings held
in too universal veneration to be tampered with were written in a very
ancient and very pure idiom which had not been revived and whose close
resemblance with the zend put back the date of the composition of the
books beyond the time of the separation of the aryan family into two
branches the mahabharata and the ramayana dating from the brahminical
or the period succeeding that of the vedas were next studied together
with the puranas owing to a profounder knowledge of the language and a
more intimate acquaintance with the mythology of the hindus scholars
were able to fix approximately the date of the composition of these
poems to ascertain the numberless interpolations and to extract
everything of actual historical or geographical value from those
marvellous allegories

the result of these patient and minute investigations was a conviction
that the celtic greek latin germanic slave and persian languages
had one common parent and that parent none other than sanskrit if
then their language was the same it followed as a matter of course
that the people had been also identical the differences now existing
between these various idioms are accounted for by the successive
breakings up of the primitive people approximate dates enable us to
realize the greater or less affinity of those languages with the
sanskrit and the nature of the words which they have borrowed from it
words corresponding by their nature to the different degrees of advance
in civilization

moreover a very clear and definite notion was obtained of the kind of
life led by the founders of the indo-european race and the changes
brought about in it by the progress of civilization the vedas give us
a picture of the aryan race before it migrated to india and occupied
the punjab and cabulistan by the aid of these poems we can look on at
struggles against the primitive races of hindustan whose resistance
was all the more desperate in that the conqueror of their caste
divisions left them only the lowest and most degraded thanks to the
vedas we can realize every detail of the pastoral and patriarchal life
of the aryans a life so domestic and unruffled that we mentally ask
ourselves whether the eager strife of the modern peoples is not a poor
exchange for the peaceful existence which their few wants secured to
their forefathers

we cannot dwell longer on this subject but the little that we have
said will be enough to show the reader the importance to history
ethnography and philology of the study of sanskrit for further
details we refer him to the special works of orientalists and to the
excellent historical manuals of robiou lenormant and maspero all the
scientific results of whatever kind obtained up to 1820 are also
skilfully and impartially summed up in walter hamilton's large work "a
geographical statistical and historical description of hindustan and
the neighbouring countries" this is a book which by recording the
various stages of scientific progress marks with accuracy the point
reached at any given epoch

after this brief review of the labours of scholars in reference to the
intellectual and social life of the hindus we must turn to those
studies whose aim was a knowledge of the physical character of the
country

one of the most surprising results obtained by the travels of webb and
moorcroft was the extraordinary height attributed by them to the
himalaya mountains according to them their elevation exceeded that of
the loftiest summits of the andes colonel colebrook had estimated the
average height of the chain at 22000 feet and even this would appear
to be less than the reality webb measured yamunavatri one of the most
remarkable peaks of the chain and estimated its height above the level
of the plateau from which it rises as 20000 feet whilst the plateau
in its turn is 5000 feet above the plain not satisfied however with
what he looked upon as too perfunctory an estimate he measured with
all possible mathematical accuracy the dewalagiri or white mountain
and ascertained its height to be no less than 27500 feet

the most remarkable feature of the himalaya chain is the succession of
these mountains the ranges of heights rising one above the other this
gives a far more vivid impression of their loftiness than would one
isolated peak rising from a plain and with its head lost among the
clouds

the calculations of webb and colebrook were soon verified by the
mathematical observations of colonel crawford who measured eight of
the highest peaks of the himalayas according to him the loftiest of
all was chumulari situated near the frontiers of bhoutan and thibet
which attains to a height of 30000 feet above the sea-level

results such as these confirmed by the agreement of so many observers
who could not surely all be wrong took the scientific world by
surprise the chief objection urged was the fact that the snow-line
must in these districts be something like 30000 feet above the
sea-level it appeared therefore impossible to believe the assertion
of all the explorers that the himalayas were covered with forests of
gigantic pines finally however actual personal observation upset
theory in a second journey webb climbed the niti-ghaut the loftiest
peak in the world the height of which he fixed at 16814 feet and not
only did he find no snow but even the rocks rising 300 feet above it
were quite free from snow in summer moreover the steep sides where
breathing was difficult were clothed with magnificent forests of
tapering pines and firs and wide-spreading cypress and cedar-trees

"the high limits of perpetual snow on the himalaya mountains" says
desborough cooley "are justly ascribed by mr webb to the great
elevation of the table-land or terrace from which these mountain peaks
spring as the heat of our atmosphere is derived chiefly from the
radiation of the earth's surface it follows that the temperature of
any elevated point must be modified in a very important degree by the
proximity and extent of the surrounding plains these observations seem
satisfactorily to refute the objections made by certain savants
respecting the great height of the himalaya mountains which may be
therefore safely pronounced to be the loftiest mountain chain on the
surface of the globe"

we must now refer briefly to an expedition in the latitudes already
visited by webb and moorcroft the traveller fraser with neither the
necessary instruments nor knowledge for measuring the lofty peaks he
ascended was endowed with a great power of observation and his
account of his journey is full of interest and here and there very
amusing he visited the source of the jumna and at a height of more
than 25000 feet he found numerous villages picturesquely perched on
slopes carpetted with snow he then made his way to gangoutri in spite
of the opposition of his guides who represented the road thither as
extremely dangerous declaring that it was swept by a pestilential wind
which would deprive any traveller who ventured to expose himself to
it of his senses the explorer however was more than rewarded for
all his dangers and fatigues by the enjoyment he derived from the
grandeur and magnificence of the views he obtained

[illustration "villages picturesquely perched"]

"there is that" says desborough cooley in reference to fraser's
journey "in the appearance of the himalaya range which every person
who has seen them will allow to be peculiarly their own no other
mountains that i have ever seen bear any resemblance to their
character their summits shoot in the most fantastic and spiring peaks
to a height that astonishes and when viewed from an elevated
situation almost induce the belief of an ocular deception"

we must now leave the peninsula of the ganges for that of arabia where
we have to record the result of several interesting journeys that of
captain sadler of the indian army claims the first rank sent by the
governor of bombay in 1819 on an embassy to ibrahim pacha who was
then at war with the wahabees that officer crossed the entire
peninsula from port el katif on the persian gulf to yambo on the red
sea

unfortunately the interesting account of this crossing of arabia never
before accomplished by a european has not been separately published
but is buried in a book which it is almost impossible to obtain "the
transactions of the literary society of bombay"

at about the same time 1821-1826 the english government commissioned
captains moresby and haines of the naval service to make
hydrographical surveys with a view to obtaining a complete chart of the
coasts of arabia these surveys were to be the foundation of the first
trustworthy map of the arabian peninsula

we have now only to mention the two expeditions of the french
naturalists aucher eloy in the country of oman and emile botta in
yemen and to refer to the labours in reference to the idioms and
antiquities of arabia of the french consul at djedda fulgence fresnel
he was the first in his letters on the history of the arabs before
islamism published in 1836 to explain the himyarite or homeric
language and to recognize that it resembles rather the early hebrew and
syriac dialects than the arabic of the present day

at the beginning of this volume we spoke of the explorations and
archæological and historical researches of seetzen and burckhardt in
syria and palestine we have still to say a few words on an expedition
the results of which were entirely geographical we refer to the
journey of the bavarian naturalist heinrich schubert

schubert was a devout catholic and an enthusiastic student and the
melancholy scenery of the holy land with its wonderful legends and the
lovely banks of the mysterious nile with its historic memories had for
him an extraordinary fascination in his account of his journey we find
the deep impressions of the believer combined with the scientific
observations of the naturalist

in 1837 schubert having crossed lower egypt and the peninsula of
sinai entered the holy land the learned bavarian pilgrim was
accompanied by two friends dr erdl and martin bernatz a painter

the travellers landed at el akabah on the red sea and went with a
small arab caravan to el khalil the ancient hebron the route they
followed had never before been trodden by a european it led through a
wide flat valley terminating at the dead sea a valley through which
the waters of the dead sea were supposed at one time to have flowed
towards the red sea this hypothesis was shared by burckhardt and many
others who had only seen the district from a distance and who
attributed the cessation of the drainage to an upheaval of the soil
the heights as taken by the travellers showed this hypothesis to be
altogether erroneous

in fact from the lower end of the persian gulf the country presents a
continuous ascent for two or three days' march to the point called by
the arabs the saddle from thence it begins to sink and slopes down
towards the dead sea the saddle is about 2100 feet above the
sea-level at least that was the estimate given a year later by count
bertou a frenchman who visited those localities at that time

on their way down to the bituminous lake schubert and his companions
took some other barometrical observations and were very much surprised
to find their instrument marking ninety-one feet below the red sea
the levels gradually decreasing in height as they advanced at first
they thought there must be some mistake but finally the evidence was
too strong for them and it became proved beyond a doubt that the dead
sea could never have emptied its waters into the red sea for the very
excellent reason that the level of the former is very much lower than
that of the latter

the depression of the dead sea is very much more noticeable when
jericho is approached from jerusalem in that case the way lies through
a long valley with a very rapid slope all the more remarkable as the
hilly plains of judea peræ and el harran are very lofty the latter
rising to a height of nearly 3000 feet above the sea-level

the appearance of the country and the testimony of the instruments were
in such contradiction to the prevalent belief that messrs erdl and
schubert were very unwilling to accept the results obtained which they
attributed to their barometer being out of order and to a sudden
disturbance of the atmosphere but on their way back to jerusalem the
barometer returned to the mean height it had registered before they
started for jericho there was nothing for it then but to admit
whether they liked it or not that the dead sea was at least 600 feet
below the level of the mediterranean an estimate as later researches
showed which fell one-half short of the truth

this it will be admitted was a fortunate rectification which would
have considerable influence by calling the attention of savants to a
phenomenon which was soon to be verified by other explorers

at the same time the survey of the basin of the dead sea was completed
and rectified in 1838 two american missionaries edward robinson and
eli smith gave quite a new impulse to biblical geography they were
the forerunners of that phalanx of naturalists historians
archæologists and engineers who under the patronage or in
conjunction with the english exploration society were soon to explore
the land of the patriarchs from end to end making maps of it and
achieving discoveries which threw a new light on the history of the
ancient peoples who by turns were possessors of this corner of the
mediterranean basin

but it was not only the holy land so interesting on account of the
many associations it has for every christian which was the scene of
the researches of scholars and explorers asia minor was also soon to
yield up her treasures to the curiosity of the learned world that
country was visited by travellers in every direction parrot visited
armenia dubois de monpereux traversed the caucasus in 1839 in 1825
and 1826 eichwald explored the shores of the caspian sea and lastly
alexander von humboldt at the expense of the generous nicholas emperor
of russia supplemented his intrepid work as a discoverer in the new
world by an exploration of western asia and the ural mountains
accompanied by the mineralogist gustave rose the naturalist ehrenberg
well known for his travels in upper egypt and nubia and baron von
helmersen an officer of engineers humboldt travelled through siberia
visited the gold and platinum mines of the ural mountains and explored
the caspian steppes and the altai chain to the frontiers of china
these learned men divided the work humboldt taking astronomical
magnetic and physical observations and examining the flora and fauna
of the country while rose kept the journal of the expedition which he
published in german between 1837 and 1842

although the explorers travelled very rapidly at the rate of no less
than 11500 miles in nine months the scientific results of their
journey were considerable in a first publication which appeared in
paris in 1838 humboldt treated only the climatology and geology of
asia but this fragmentary account was succeeded in 1843 by his great
work called "central asia" "in this" says la roquette "he has laid
down and systematized the principal scientific results of his
expedition in asia and has recorded some ingenious speculation as to
the shape of the continents and the configuration of the mountains of
tartary giving special attention to the vast depression which
stretches from the north of europe to the centre of asia beyond the
caspian sea and the ural river"

we must now leave asia and pass in review the various expeditions in
the new world which have been sent out in succession since the
beginning of the present century in 1807 when lewis and clarke were
crossing north america from the united states to the pacific ocean the
government commissioned a young officer lieutenant zabulon montgomery
pike to examine the sources of the mississippi he was at the same
time to endeavour to open friendly relations with any indians he might
meet

[illustration map of the missouri]

pike was well received by the chief of the powerful sioux nation and
presented with the pipe of peace a talisman which secured to him the
protection of the allied tribes he ascended the mississippi passing
the mouths of the chippeway and st peter important tributaries of
that great river but beyond the confluence of the st peter with the
mississippi as far as the falls of st anthony the course of the main
river is impeded by an uninterrupted series of falls and rapids a
little below the 45th parallel of north latitude pike and his
companions had to leave their canoes and continue their journey in
sledges to the severity of a bitter winter were soon added the
tortures of hunger nothing however checked the intrepid explorers
who continued to follow the mississippi now dwindled down to a stream
only 300 roods wide and arrived in february at leech lake where they
were received with enthusiasm at the camp of some trappers and fur
hunters from montreal

[illustration circassians (fac-simile of early engraving)]

after visiting red cedar lake pike returned to st louis his arduous
and perilous journey had extended over no less than nine months and
although he had not attained its main object it was not without
scientific results the skill presence of mind and courage of pike
were recognized and the government soon afterwards conferred on him
the rank of major and appointed him to the command of a fresh
expedition this time he was to explore the vast tract of country
between the mississippi and the rocky mountains and to discover the
sources of the arkansas and red river with twenty-three companions
pike ascended the arkansas a fine river navigable to the mountains in
which it rises that is to say for a distance of 2000 miles except in
the summer when its bed is encumbered with sand-banks on this long
voyage winter from which pike had suffered so much on his previous
trip set in with redoubled vigour game was so scarce that for four
days the explorers were without food the feet of several men were
frostbitten and this misfortune added to the fatigue of the others
the major after reaching the source of the arkansas pursued a
southerly direction and soon came to a fine stream which he took for
the red river

this was the rio del norte which rises in colorado then a spanish
province and flows into the gulf of mexico

from what has been already said of the difficulties which humboldt
encountered before he obtained permission to enter the spanish
possessions in america we may judge with what jealous suspicion the
arrival of strangers in colorado was regarded pike was surrounded by a
detachment of spanish soldiers made prisoner with all his men and
taken to santa fé their ragged garments emaciated forms and
generally miserable appearance did not speak much in their favour and
the spaniards at first took the americans for savages however when
the mistake was recognized they were escorted across the inland
provinces to louisiana arriving at natchitoches on the 1st july 1807

the unfortunate end of this expedition cooled the zeal of the
government but not that of private persons merchants and hunters
whose numbers were continually on the increase many even completely
crossed the american continent from canada to the pacific amongst
these travellers we must mention daniel william harmon a member of the
north-west company who visited lakes huron and superior rainy lake
the lake of the woods manitoba winnipeg athabasca and the great
bear lake all between n lat 47 degrees and 58 degrees and reached
the shores of the pacific the fur company established at astoria at
the mouth of the columbia also did much towards the exploration of the
rocky mountains

four associates of that company leaving astoria in june 1812
ascended the columbia crossed the rocky mountains and following an
east-south-east direction reached one of the sources of the platte
descended it to its junction with the missouri crossed a district
never before explored and arrived at st louis on the 30th may 1813

in 1811 another expedition composed of sixty men started from st
louis and ascended the missouri as far as the settlements of the ricara
indians whence they made their way to astoria arriving there at the
beginning of 1812 after the loss of several men and great suffering
from fatigue and want of food

these journeys resulted not only in the increase of our knowledge of
the topography of the districts traversed but they also brought about
quite unexpected discoveries in the ohio valley between illinois and
mexico for instance were found ruins fortifications and
entrenchments with ditches and a kind of bastion many of them
covering five or six acres of ground what people can have constructed
works such as these which denote a civilization greatly in advance of
that of the indians is a difficult problem of which no solution has
yet been found

philologists and historians were already regretting the dying out of
the indian tribes who until then had been only superficially
observed and lamenting their extinction before their languages had
been studied a knowledge of these languages and their comparison with
those of the old world might have thrown some unexpected light upon
the origin of the wandering tribes[2]

[footnote 2 the author has evidently not seen bancroft's "native races
of the pacific" an exhaustive work in five volumes published at new
york and san francisco a few years ago and which embodies the
researches of a number of gentlemen who collected their information on
the spot and whose contributions to our knowledge of the past and
present life of the indians should certainly not be ignored trans]

simultaneously with the discovery of the ruins the flora and geology of
the country began to be studied and in the latter science great
surprises were in store for future explorers it was so important for
the american government to proceed rapidly to reconnoitre the vast
territories between the united states and the pacific that another
expedition was speedily sent out

in 1819 the military authorities commissioned major long to explore
the districts between the mississippi and the rocky mountains to trace
the course of the missouri and of its principal tributaries to fix the
latitude and longitude of the chief places to study the ways of the
indian tribes in fact to describe everything interesting either in the
aspect of the country or in its animal vegetable and mineral
productions

leaving pittsburgh on the 5th march 1819 on board the steamship
western engineer the expedition arrived in may of the following year
at the junction of the ohio with the mississippi and ascended the
latter river as far as st louis on the 29th june the mouth of the
missouri was reached during the month of july mr say who was
charged with the zoological observations made his way by land to fort
osage where he was joined by the steamer major long turned his stay
at fort osage to account by sending a party to examine the districts
between the kansas and the platte but this party was attacked robbed
and compelled to turn back after losing all their horses after
obtaining at cow island a reinforcement of fifteen soldiers the
expedition reached fort lisa near council bluff on the 19th
september there it was decided to winter the americans suffered
greatly from scurvy and having no medicines to check the terrible
disorder they lost 100 men nearly a third of the whole party major
long who had meanwhile reached washington in a canoe brought back
orders for the discontinuation of the voyage up the missouri and for a
journey overland to the sources of the platte whence the mississippi
was to be reached by way of the arkansas and red river on the 6th
june the explorers left engineer's fort as they called their winter
quarters and ascended the platte valley for more than a hundred miles
its grassy plains frequented by vast herds of bisons and deer
supplying them with plenty of provisions

those boundless prairies whose monotony is unbroken by a single
hillock were succeeded by a sandy desert gradually sloping up for a
distance of nearly four hundred miles to the rocky mountains this
desert broken by precipitous ravines cañons and gorges at the
bottom of which gurgles some insignificant stream its banks clothed
with stunted and meagre vegetation produces nothing but cacti with
sharp and formidable prickles

on the 6th july the expedition reached the foot of the rocky
mountains dr james scaled one of the peaks to which he gave his own
name and which rises to a height of 11500 feet above the sea level

"from the summit of the peak" says the botanist "the view towards the
north west and south-west is diversified with innumerable mountains
all white with snow and on some of the more distant it appears to
extend down to their bases immediately under our feet on the west lay
the narrow valley of the arkansas which we could trace running towards
the north-west probably more than sixty miles on the north side of
the peak was an immense mass of snow and ice to the east lay the
great plain rising as it receded until in the distant horizon it
appeared to mingle with the sky"

here the expedition was divided into two parties one under the
command of major long to make its way to the sources of the red river
the other under captain bell to go down the arkansas as far as port
smith the two detachments separated on the 24th july the former
misled by the statements of the kaskaia indians and the inaccuracy of
the maps took the canadian for the red river and did not discover
their mistake until they reached its junction with the arkansas the
kaskaias were the most miserable of savages but intrepid horsemen
excelling in lassoing the wild mustangs which are descendants of the
horses imported into mexico by the spanish conquerors the second
detachment was deserted by four soldiers who carried off the journals
of say and lieutenant swift with a number of other valuable effects
both parties also suffered from want of provisions in the sandy
deserts whose streams yield nothing but brackish and muddy water the
expedition brought to washington sixty skins of wild animals several
thousands of insects including five hundred new species four or five
hundred specimens of hitherto unknown plants numerous views of the
scenery and the materials for a map of the districts traversed

[illustration "excelling in lassoing the wild mustangs"]

the command of another expedition was given in 1828 to major long
whose services were thoroughly appreciated leaving philadelphia in
april he embarked on the ohio and crossed the state of the same name
and those of indiana and illinois having reached the mississippi he
ascended that river to the mouth of the st peter formerly visited by
carver and later by baron la hontan long followed the st peter to
its source passing crooked lake and reaching lake winnipeg whence he
explored the river of the same name obtained a sight of the lake of
the woods and rainy lake and arrived at the plateau which separates
the hudson's bay valley from that of the st lawrence lastly he went
to lake superior by way of cold water lake and dog river

although all these districts had been constantly traversed by canadian
pathfinders trappers and hunters for many years previously it was
the first time an official expedition had visited them with a view to
the laying down of a map the explorers were struck with the beauty of
the neighbourhood watered by the winnipeg that river whose course is
frequently broken by picturesque rapids and waterfalls flows between
two perpendicular granite walls crowned with verdure the beauty of the
scenery succeeding as it did to the monotony of the plains and
savannahs they had previously traversed filled the explorers with
admiration

the exploration of the mississippi which had been neglected since
pike's expedition was resumed in 1820 by general cass governor of
michigan leaving detroit at the end of may with twenty men trained to
the work of pathfinders he reached the upper mississippi after
visiting lakes huron superior and sandy his exhausted escort halted
to rest whilst he continued the examination of the river in a canoe
for 150 miles the course of the mississippi is rapid and uninterrupted
but beyond that distance begins a series of rapids extending over
twelve miles to the peckgama falls

above this cataract the stream now far less rapid winds through vast
savannahs to leech lake having reached lake winnipeg cass arrived on
the 21st july at a new lake to which he gave his own name but he did
not care to push on further with his small party of men and inadequate
supply of provisions and ammunition

the source of the mississippi had been approached but not reached the
general opinion was that the river took its rise in a small sheet of
water known as deer lake sixty miles from cass lake not until 1832
however when general cass was secretary of state for war was this
important problem solved

the command of an expedition was then given to a traveller named
schoolcraft who had in the previous year explored the chippeway
country north-west of lake superior his party consisted of six
soldiers an officer qualified to conduct hydrographic surveys a
surgeon a geologist an interpreter and a missionary

schoolcraft left st marie on the 7th june 1832 visited the tribes
living about lake superior and was soon on the st louis river he was
then 150 miles from the mississippi and was told that it would take
him no less than ten days to reach the great river on account of the
rapids and shallows on the 3rd july the expedition reached the
factory of a trader named aitkin on the banks of the river and there
celebrated on the following day the anniversary of the independence of
the united states

two days later schoolcraft found himself opposite the peckgama falls
and encamped at oak point here the river winds a great deal amongst
savannahs but guides led the party by paths which greatly shortened
the distance lake winnipeg was then crossed and on the 10th july
schoolcraft arrived at lake cass the furthest point reached by his
predecessors

[illustration map of the sources of the mississippi 1836]

a party of chippeway indians led the explorers to their settlement on
an island in the river the friendliness of the natives led cass to
leave part of his escort with them and accompanied by lieutenant
allen the surgeon houghton a missionary and several indians he
started in a canoe

lakes tasodiac and crooked were visited in turn a little beyond the
latter the mississippi divides into two branches or forks the guide
took schoolcraft up the eastern and after crossing lakes marquette la
salle and kubbakanna he came to the mouth of the naiwa the chief
tributary of this branch of the mississippi finally after passing the
little lake called usawa the expedition reached lake itasca whence
issues the itascan or western branch of the mississippi

lake itasca or deer lake as the french call it is only seven or
eight miles in extent and is surrounded by hills clothed with dark
pine woods according to schoolcraft it is some 1500 feet above the sea
level but we must not attach too much importance to this estimate as
the leader of the expedition had no instruments

on their way back to lake cass the party followed the western branch
identifying its chief tributaries schoolcraft then studied the ways of
the indians frequenting these districts and made treaties with them

to sum up the aim of the government was achieved and the mississippi
had been explored from its mouth to its source the expedition had
collected a vast number of interesting details on the manners customs
history and language of the people as well as numerous new or little
known species of flora and fauna

the people of the united states were not content with these official
expeditions and numbers of trappers threw themselves into the new
districts most of them being however absolutely illiterate they could
not turn their discoveries to scientific account but this was not the
case with james pattie who has published an account of his romantic
adventures and perilous trips in the district between new mexico and
new california

on his way down the river gila to its mouth pattie visited races then
all but unknown including the yotans eiotaws papawans mokees
umeas mohawas and nabahoes with whom but very little intercourse had
yet been held on the banks of the rio eiotario he discovered ruins of
ancient monuments stone walls moats and potteries and in the
neighbouring mountains he found copper lead and silver mines

we owe a curious travelling journal also to doctor willard who during
a stay of three years in mexico explored the rio del norte from its
source to its mouth

lastly in 1831 captain wyeth and his brother explored oregon and the
neighbouring districts of the rocky mountains

after humboldt's journey in mexico one explorer succeeded another in
central america in 1787 bernasconi discovered the now famous ruins of
palenque in 1822 antonio del rio gave a detailed description of them
illustrated with drawings by frederick waldeck the future explorer of
palenque that city of the dead

between 1805 and 1807 three journeys were successively taken in the
province of chiapa and to palenque by captain william dupaix and the
draughtsman castañeda and the result of their researches appeared in
1830 in the form of a magnificent work with illustrations by augustine
aglio executed at the expense of lord kingsborough

lastly waldeck spent the years 1832 and 1833 at palenque searching
the ruins making plans sections and elevations of the monuments
trying to decipher the hitherto unexplained hieroglyphics with which
they are covered and collecting a vast amount of quite new information
alike on the natural history of the country and the manners and customs
of the inhabitants

we must also name don juan galindo a spanish colonel who explored
palenque utatlan copan and other cities buried in the heart of
tropical forests

[illustration view of the pyramid of xochicalco (fac-simile of early
engraving)]

after the long stay made by humboldt in equinoctial america the
impulse his explorations would doubtless otherwise have given to
geographical science was strangely checked by the struggle of the
spanish colonies with the mother country as soon however as the
native governments attained to at least a semblance of stability
intrepid explorers rushed to examine this world so new in the truest
sense for the jealousy of the spanish had hitherto kept it closed to
the investigations of scientific men

many naturalists and engineers now travelled or settled in south
america soon indeed that is in 1817-1820 the austrian and bavarian
governments sent out a scientific expedition to the command of which
they appointed doctors spix and martins who collected a great deal of
information on the botany ethnography and geography of these hitherto
little known districts martins publishing at the expense of the
austrian and bavarian governments a most important work on the flora
of the country which may be looked upon as a model of its kind

at the same time the editors of special publications such as malte
brun's annales des voyages and the bulletin de la société de
géographie cordially accepted and published all the communications
addressed to them including many on brazil and the province of minas
geraës

about this period too a prussian major-general the prince of
wied-neuwied who had been at leisure since the peace of 1815 devoted
himself to the study of natural science geography and history
undertaking moreover in company with the naturalists freirciss and
sellow an exploring expedition in the interior of brazil having
special reference to its flora and fauna

a few years later ie in 1836 the french naturalist alcide
d'orbigny who had won celebrity at a very early age was appointed by
the governing body of the museum to the command of an expedition to
south america the special object of which was the study of the natural
history of the country for eight consecutive years d'orbigny wandered
about brazil uruguay the argentine republic patagonia chili
bolivia and peru

"such a journey" says dumour in his funeral oration on d'orbigny "in
countries so different in their productions climate the character of
their soil and the manners and customs of their inhabitants was
necessarily full of ever fresh perils d'orbigny endowed with a strong
constitution and untiring energy overcame obstacles which would have
daunted most travellers on his arrival in the cold regions of
patagonia amongst savage races constantly at war with each other he
found himself compelled to take part and to fight in the ranks of a
tribe which had received him hospitably fortunately for the intrepid
student his side was victorious and he was left free to proceed on his
journey"

it took thirteen years of the hardest work to put together the results
of d'orbigny's extensive researches his book which embraces nearly
every branch of science leaves far behind it all that had ever before
been published on south america history archæology zoology and
botany all hold honoured positions in it but the most important part
of this encyclopædic work is that relating to american man in it the
author embodies all the documents he himself collected and analyzes
and criticizes those which came to him at second hand on physiological
types and on the manners languages and religions of south america a
work of such value ought to immortalize the name of the french scholar
and reflect the greatest honour on the nation which gave him birth

voyages round the world and polar expeditions

canoes of the caroline islanders guam a desert island beauty and
happy situation of the bonin islands the tchouktchees their manners
and their conjurors return to russia


at the beginning of the nineteenth century the russians for the first
time took part in voyages round the world until that time their
explorations had been almost entirely confined to asia and their only
mariners of note were behring tchirikoff spangberg laxman
krenitzin and saryscheff the last-named took an important part in the
voyage of the englishman billings a voyage by the way which was far
from achieving all that might have been fairly expected from the ten
years it occupied and the vast sums it cost

adam john von kruzenstern was the first russian to whom is due the
honour of having made a voyage round the world under government
auspices and with a scientific purpose

born in 1770 kruzenstern entered the english navy in 1793 after six
years' training in the stern school which then numbered amongst its
leaders the most skilful sailors of the world he returned to his
native land with a profound knowledge of his profession and with his
ideas of the part russia might play in eastern asia very considerably
widened

during a stay of two years at canton in 1798 and 1799 kruzenstern had
been witness of the extraordinary results achieved by some english fur
traders who brought their merchandise from the northwest coasts of
russian america this trade had not come into existence until after
cook's third voyage and the english had already realized immense sums
at the cost of the russians who had hitherto sent their furs to the
chinese markets overland

in 1785 however a russian named chelikoff founded a fur-trading
colony on kodiak island at about an equal distance from kamtchatka and
the aleutian islands which rapidly became a flourishing community the
russian government now recognized the resources of districts it had
hitherto considered barren and reinforcements provisions and stores
were sent to kamtchatka via siberia

kruzenstern quickly realized how inadequate to the new state of things
was help such as this the ignorance of the pilots and the errors in
the maps leading to the loss of several vessels every year not to
speak of the injury to trade involved in a two years' voyage for the
transport of furs first to okhotsk and thence to kiakhta

as the best plans are always the simplest they are sure to be the last
to be thought of and kruzenstern was the first to point out the
imperative necessity of going direct by sea from the aleutian islands
to canton the most frequented market

on his return to russia kruzenstern tried to win over to his views
count kuscheleff the minister of marine but the answer he received
destroyed all hope not until the accession of alexander i when
admiral mordinoff became head of the naval department did he receive
any encouragement

acting on count romanoff's advice the russian emperor soon
commissioned kruzenstern to carry out the plan he had himself proposed
and on the 7th august 1802 he was appointed to the command of two
vessels for the exploration of the north-west coast of america

although the leader of the expedition was named the officers and
seamen were still to be selected and the vessels to be manned were not
to be had in either the russian empire or at hamburg in london alone
were lisianskoï afterwards second in command to kruzenstern and the
builder kasoumoff able to obtain two vessels at all suitable to the
service in which they were to be employed these two vessels received
the names of the nadiejeda and the neva

in the meantime the russian government decided to avail itself of this
opportunity to send m de besanoff to japan as ambassador with a
numerous suite and magnificent presents for the sovereign of the
country

on the 4th august 1803 the two vessels completely equipped and
carrying 134 persons left the roadstead of cronstadt flying visits
were paid to copenhagen and falmouth with a view to replacing some of
the salt provisions bought at hamburg and to caulk the nadiejeda
the seams of which had started in a violent storm encountered in the
north sea

after a short stay at the canary islands kruzenstern hunted in vain
as la pérouse had done before him for the island of ascension as to
the existence of which opinion had been divided for some three hundred
years he then rounded cape frio the position of which he was unable
exactly to determine although he was most anxious to do so the
accounts of earlier travellers and the maps hitherto laid down varying
from 23 degrees 6 minutes to 22 degrees 34 minutes a reconnaissance of
the coast of brazil was succeeded by a sail through the passage between
the islands of gal and alvaredo unjustly characterized as dangerous by
la pérouse and on the 21st december 1803 st catherine was reached

the necessity for replacing the main and mizzen masts of the neva
detained kruzenstern for five weeks on this island where he was most
cordially received by the portuguese authorities

on the 4th february the two vessels were able to resume their voyage
prepared to face all the dangers of the south sea and to double cape
horn that bugbear of all navigators as far as staten island the
weather was uniformly fine but beyond it the explorers had to contend
with extremely violent gales storms of hail and snow dense fogs huge
waves and a swell in which the vessels laboured heavily on the 24th
march the ships lost sight of each other in a dense fog a little above
the western entrance to the straits of magellan they did not meet
again until both reached noukha-hiva

kruzenstern having given up all idea of touching at easter island now
made for the marquesas or mendoza archipelago and determined the
position of fatongou and udhugu islands called washington by the
american captain ingraham who discovered them in 1791 a few weeks
before captain marchand who named them revolution islands kruzenstern
also saw hiva-hoa the dominica of mendaña and at noukha-hiva met an
englishman named roberts and a frenchman named cabritt whose
knowledge of the language was of great service to him

the incidents of the stay in the marquesas archipelago are of little
interest they were much the same as those related in cook's voyages
the total but at the same time utterly unconscious immodesty of the
women the extensive agricultural knowledge of the natives and their
greed of iron instruments are commented upon in both narratives

nothing is noticed in the later which is not to be found in the earlier
narrative if we except some remarks on the existence of numerous
societies of which the king or his relations priests or celebrated
warriors are the chiefs and the aim of which is the providing of the
people with food in times of scarcity in our opinion these societies
resemble the clans of scotland or the indian tribes of america
kruzenstern however does not agree with us as the following
quotation will show

"the members of these clubs are distinguished by different tattooed
marks upon their bodies those of the king's club consisting of
twenty-six members have a square one on their breasts about six inches
long and four wide and to this company roberts belonged the
companions of the frenchman joseph cabritt were marked with a
tattooed eye &c roberts assured me that he never would have entered
this association had he not been driven to it by extreme hunger there
was an apparent want of consistency in this dislike as the members of
these companies are not only relieved from all care as to their
subsistence but even by his own account the admittance into them is
a distinction that many seek to obtain i am therefore inclined to
believe that it must be attended with the loss of some part of
liberty"

a reconnaissance of the neighbourhood of anna maria led to the
discovery of port tchitchagoff which though the entrance is
difficult is so shut in by land that its waters are unruffled by the
most violent storm

at the time of kruzenstern's visit to noukha-hiva cannibalism was
still largely practised but the traveller had no tangible proof of the
prevalence of the custom in fact kruzenstern was very affably received
by the king of the cannibals who appeared to exercise but little
authority over his people a race addicted to the most revolting vices
and our hero owns that but for the intelligent and disinterested
testimony of the two europeans mentioned above he should have carried
away a very favourable opinion of the natives

"in their intercourse with us" he says "they always showed the best
possible disposition and in bartering an extraordinary degree of
honesty always delivering their cocoa-nuts before they received the
piece of iron that was to be paid for them at all times they appeared
ready to assist in cutting wood and filling water and the help they
afforded us in the performance of these laborious tasks was by no means
trifling theft the crime so common to all the islanders of this
ocean we very seldom met with among them they always appeared
cheerful and happy and the greatest good humour was depicted in their
countenances the two europeans whom we found here and who had both
resided with them several years agreed in their assertions that the
natives of nukahiva were a cruel intractable people and without even
the exceptions of the female sex very much addicted to cannibalism
that the appearance of content and good-humour with which they had so
much deceived us was not their true character and that nothing but
the fear of punishment and the hopes of reward deterred them from
giving a loose to their savage passions these europeans described as
eye-witnesses the barbarous scenes that are acted particularly in
times of war the desperate rage with which they fall upon their
victims immediately tear off their head and sip their blood out of
the skull[1] with the most disgusting readiness completing in this
manner their horrible repast for a long time i would not give credit
to these accounts considering them as exaggerated but they rest upon
the authority of two different persons who had not only been witnesses
for several years to these atrocities but had also borne a share in
them of two persons who lived in a state of mortal enmity and took
particular pains by their mutual recriminations to obtain with us
credit for themselves but yet on this point never contradicted each
other the very fact of roberts doing his enemy the justice to allow
that he never devoured his prey but always exchanged it for hogs
gives the circumstance a great degree of probability and these reports
concur with several appearances we remarked during our stay here
skulls being brought to us every day for sale their weapons are
invariably adorned with human hair and human bones are used as
ornaments in almost all their household furniture they also often gave
us to understand by pantomimic gestures that human flesh was regarded
by them as a delicacy"

[footnote 1 "all the skulls which we purchased of them" says
kruzenstern "had a hole perforated through one end of them for this
purpose"]

there are grounds for looking upon this account as exaggerated the
truth probably lies between the dogmatic assertions of cook and
forster and those of the two europeans of kruzenstern's time one of
whom at least was not much to be relied upon as he was a deserter

and we must remember that we ourselves did not attain to the high state
of civilization we now enjoy without climbing up from the bottom of the
ladder in the stone age our manners were probably not superior to
those of the natives of oceania

we must not therefore blame these representatives of humanity for not
having risen higher they have never been a nation scattered as their
homes are on the wide ocean and divided as they are into small tribes
without agricultural or mineral resources without connexions and with
a climate which makes them strangers to want they could but remain
stationary or cultivate none but the most rudimentary arts and
industries yet in spite of all this how often have their instruments
their canoes and their nets excited the admiration of travellers

on the 18th may 1804 the nadiejeda and the neva left noukha-hiva
for the sandwich islands where kruzenstern had decided to stop and lay
in a store of fresh provisions which he had been unable to do at his
last anchorage where seven pigs were all he could get

this plan fell through however the natives of owhyhee or hawaii
brought but a very few provisions to the vessels lying off their
south-west coast and even these they would only exchange for cloth
which kruzenstern could not give them he therefore set sail for
kamtchatka and japan leaving the neva off the island of karakakoua
where captain lisianskoï relied upon being able to revictual

[illustration new zealanders (fac-simile of early engraving)]

on the 11th july the nadiejeda arrived off petropaulovski the
capital of kamtchatka where the crew obtained the rest and fresh
provisions they had so well earned on the 30th august the russians
put to sea again

overtaken by thick fogs and violent storms kruzenstern now hunted in
vain for some islands marked on a map found on a spanish gallion
captured by anson and the existence of which had been alternately
accepted and rejected by different cartographers though they appear in
la billardière's map of his voyage

the navigator now passed between the large island of kiushiu and
tanega-sima by way of van diemen strait till then very inaccurately
defined rectified the position of the liu-kiu archipelago which the
english had placed north of the strait and the french too far south
and sailed down surveyed and named the coast of the province of
satsuma

"this part of satsuma" says kruzenstern "is particularly beautiful
and as we sailed along at a very trifling distance from the land we
had a distinct and perfect view of the various picturesque situations
that rapidly succeed each other the whole country consists of high
pointed hills at one time appearing in the form of pyramids at others
of a globular or conical form and seeming as it were under the
protection of some neighbouring mountain such as peak homer or
another lying north-by-west of it and even a third farther inland
liberal as nature has been in the adornment of these parts the
industry of the japanese seems not a little to have contributed to
their beauty for nothing indeed can equal the extraordinary degree of
cultivation everywhere apparent that all the valleys upon this coast
should be most carefully cultivated would not so much have surprised
us as in the countries of europe where agriculture is not despised
it is seldom that any piece of land is left neglected but we here saw
not only the mountains even to their summits but the very tops of the
rocks which skirted the edge of the coast adorned with the most
beautiful fields and plantations forming a striking as well as
singular contrast by the opposition of their dark grey and blue colour
to that of the most lively verdure another object that excited our
astonishment was an alley of high trees stretching over hill and dale
along the coast as far as the eye could reach with arbours at certain
distances probably for the weary traveller for whom these alleys must
have been constructed to rest himself in an attention which cannot
well be exceeded these alleys are not uncommon in japan for we saw a
similar one in the vicinity of nangasaky and another in the island of
meac-sima"

[illustration coast of japan]

the nadiejeda had hardly anchored at the entrance to nagasaki harbour
before kruzenstern saw several daïmios climb on board who had come
to forbid him to advance further

now although the russians were aware of the policy of isolation
practised by the japanese government they had hoped that their
reception would have been less forbidding as they had on board an
ambassador from the powerful neighbouring state of russia they had
relied on enjoying comparative liberty of which they would have
availed themselves to collect information on a country hitherto so
little known and about which the only people admitted to it had taken a
vow of silence

they were however disappointed in their expectations instead of
enjoying the same latitude as the dutch they were throughout their
stay harassed by a perpetual surveillance as unceasing as it was
annoying in a word they were little better than prisoners

although the ambassador did obtain permission to land with his escort
"under arms" a favour never before accorded to any one the sailors
were not allowed to get out of their boat or when they did land the
restricted place where they were permitted to walk was surrounded by a
lofty palisading and guarded by two companies of soldiers

it was forbidden to write to europe by way of batavia it was forbidden
to talk to the dutch captains the ambassador was forbidden to leave
his house the word forbidden may be said to sum up the anything but
cordial reception given to their visitors by the japanese

kruzenstern turned his long stay here to account by completely
overhauling and repairing his vessel he had nearly finished this
operation when the approach was announced of an envoy from the emperor
of dignity so exalted that in the words of the interpreter "he dared
to look at the feet of his imperial majesty"

this personage began by refusing the czar's presents under pretence
that if they were accepted the emperor would have to send back others
with an embassy which would be contrary to the customs of the country
and he then went on to speak of the law against the entry of any
vessels into the ports of japan and absolutely forbade the russians to
buy anything adding however at the same time that the materials
already supplied for the refitting and revictualling the vessel would
be paid for out of the treasury of the emperor of japan he further
inquired whether the repairs of the nadiejeda would soon be finished
kruzenstern understood what was meant as soon as his visitor began to
speak and hurried on the preparations for his own departure

truly he had not much reason to congratulate himself on having waited
from october to april for such an answer as this so little were the
chief results hoped for by his government achieved that no russian
vessel could ever again enter a japanese port a short-sighted jealous
policy resulting in the putting back for half a century the progress
of japan

on the 17th april the nadiejeda weighed anchor and began a
hydrographic survey which had the best results la pérouse had been
the only navigator to traverse before kruzenstern the seas between
japan and the continent the russian explorer was therefore anxious to
connect his work with that of his predecessor and to fill up the gaps
the latter had been compelled for want of time to leave in his charts
of these parts

"to explore the north-west and south-west coasts of japan" says
kruzenstern "to ascertain the situation of the straits of sangar the
width of which in the best charts arrowsmith's 'south sea pilot' for
instance and the atlas subjoined to la pérouse's voyage is laid down
as more than a hundred miles while the japanese merely estimated it to
be a dutch mile to examine the west coast of yezo to find out the
island of karafuto which in some new charts compiled after a japanese
one is placed between yezo and sachalin and the existence of which
appeared to me very probable to explore this new strait and take an
accurate plan of the island of sachalin from cape crillon to the
north-west coast from whence if a good harbour were to be found
there i could send out my long boat to examine the supposed passage
which divides tartary from sachalin and finally to attempt a return
through a new passage between the kuriles north of the canal de la
boussole all this came into my plan and i have had the good fortune
to execute part of it"

kruzenstern was destined almost entirely to carry out this detailed
plan only the survey of the western coast of japan and of the strait
of sangar with that of the channel closing the farakaï strait could
not be accomplished by the russian navigator who had sorely against
his will to leave the completion of this important task to his
successors

kruzenstern now entered the corea channel and determined the longitude
of tsusima obtaining a difference of thirty-six minutes from the
position assigned to that island by la pérouse this difference was
subsequently confirmed by dagelet who can be fully relied upon

the russian explorer noticed as la pérouse had done before him that
the deviation of the magnetic needle is but little noticeable in these
latitudes

the position of sangar strait between yezo and niphon being very
uncertain kruzenstern resolved to determine it the mouth situated
between cape sangar (n lat 41 degrees 16 minutes 30 seconds and w
long 219 degrees 46 minutes) and cape nadiejeda (n lat 41 degrees 25
minutes 10 seconds w long 219 degrees 50 minutes 30 seconds) is
only nine miles wide whereas la pérouse who had relied not upon
personal observation but upon the map of the dutchman vries speaks of
it as ten miles across kruzenstern's was therefore an important
rectification

kruzenstern did not actually enter this strait he was anxious to
verify the existence of a certain island karafonto tchoka or chicha
by name set down as between yezo and saghalien in a map which appeared
at st petersburg in 1802 and was based on one brought to russia by
the japanese koday he then surveyed a small portion of the coast of
yezo naming the chief irregularities and cast anchor near the
southernmost promontory of the island at the entrance to the straits
of la pérouse

here he learnt from the japanese that saghalien and karafonto were one
and the same island

on the 10th may 1805 kruzenstern landed at yezo and was surprised to
find the season but little advanced the trees were not yet in leaf
the snow still lay thick here and there and the explorer had supposed
that it was only at archangel that the temperature would be so severe
at this time of year this phenomenon was to be explained later when
more was known as to the direction taken by the polar current which
issuing from behring strait washes the shores of kamtchatka the
kurile islands and yezo

during his short stay here and at saghalien kruzenstern was able to
make some observations on the ainos a race which probably occupied the
whole of yezo before the advent of the japanese from whom at least
from those who have been influenced by intercourse with china they
differ entirely

[illustration typical ainos (fac-simile of early engraving)]

"their figure" says kruzenstern "dress appearance and their
language prove that they are the same people as those of saghalien
and the captain of the castricum when he missed the straits of la
pérouse might imagine as well in aniwa as in alkys that he was but
in one island the ainos are rather below the middle stature being
at the most five feet two or four inches high of a dark nearly black
complexion with a thick bushy beard black rough hair hanging
straight down and excepting in the beard they have the appearance of
the kamtschadales only that their countenance is much more regular
the women are sufficiently ugly their colour which is equally dark
their coal black hair combed over their faces blue painted lips and
tattooed hands added to no remarkable cleanliness in their clothing
do not give them any great pretensions to loveliness however i
must do them the justice to say that they are modest in the highest
degree and in this point form the completest contrast with the women
of nukahiva and of otaheite the characteristic quality of an aino
is goodness of heart which is expressed in the strongest manner in his
countenance and so far as we were enabled to observe their actions
they fully answered this expression the dress of the ainos consists
chiefly of the skins of tame dogs and seals but i have seen some in a
very different attire which resembled the parkis of the
kamtschadales and is properly speaking a white shirt worn over their
other clothes in aniwa bay they were all clad in furs their boots
were made of seal-skins and in these likewise the women were
invariably clothed"

after passing through the straits of la pérouse kruzenstern cast
anchor in aniwa bay off the island of saghalien here fish was then so
plentiful that two japanese firms alone employed 400 ainos to catch
and dry it it is never taken in nets but buckets are used at
ebb-tide

after having surveyed patience gulf which had only been partially
examined by the dutchman vries and at the bottom of which flows a
stream now named the neva kruzenstern broke off his examination of
saghalien to determine the position of the kurile islands never yet
accurately laid down and on the 5th june 1805 he returned to
petropaulovski where he put on shore the ambassador and his suite

in july after crossing nadiejeda strait between matona and rachona
two of the kurile islands kruzenstern surveyed the eastern coast of
saghalien in the neighbourhood of cape patience which presented a
very picturesque appearance with the hills clothed with grass and
stunted trees and the shores with bushes the scenery of the interior
however was somewhat monotonous with its unbroken line of lofty
mountains

the navigator skirted along the whole of this deserted and harbourless
coast to capes maria and elizabeth between which is a deep bay with a
little village of thirty-seven houses nestling at the end the only one
the russians had seen since they left providence bay it was not
inhabited by ainos but by tartars of which very decided proof was
obtained a few days later

kruzenstern next entered the channel separating saghalien from tartary
but he was hardly six miles from the middle of the passage when his
soundings gave six fathoms only it was useless to hope to penetrate
further orders were given to "'bout ship" whilst a boat was sent to
trace the coast-line on either side and to explore the middle of the
strait until the soundings should give three fathoms only a very
strong current had to be contended with rendering this row very
difficult and this current was rightly supposed to be due to the river
amoor the mouth of which was not far distant

the advice given to kruzenstern by the governor of kamtchatka not to
approach the coast of chinese tartary lest the jealous suspicions of
the celestial government should be aroused prevented the explorer from
further prosecuting the work of surveying and once more passing the
kurile group the nadiejeda returned to petropaulovsky

the commander availed himself of his stay in this port to make some
necessary repairs in his vessel and to confirm the statements of
captain clerke who had succeeded cook in the command of his last
expedition and those of delisle de la croyère the french astronomer
who had been behring's companion in 1741

during this last sojourn at petropaulovsky kruzenstern received an
autograph letter from the emperor of russia enclosing the order of st
anne as a proof of his majesty's satisfaction with the work done

on the 4th october 1805 the nadiejeda set sail for europe
exploring en route the latitudes in which according to the maps of
the day were situated the islands of rica-de-plata guadalupas
malabrigos st sebastian de lobos and san juan

kruzenstern next identified the farellon islands of anson's map now
known as st alexander st augustine and volcanos and situated south
of the bonin-sima group then crossing the formosa channel he arrived
at macao on the 21st november

he was a good deal surprised not to find the neva there as he had
given instructions for it to bring a cargo of furs the price of which
he proposed expending on chinese merchandise he decided to wait for
the arrival of the neva

macao seemed to him to be falling rapidly into decay

"many fine buildings" he says "are ranged in large squares
surrounded by courtyards and gardens but most of them uninhabited the
number of portuguese residents there having greatly decreased the
chief private houses belong to the members of the dutch and english
factories twelve or fifteen thousand is said to be the number of
the inhabitants of macao most of whom however are chinese who have
so completely taken possession of the town that it is rare to meet any
european in the streets with the exception of priests and nuns one of
the inhabitants said to me 'we have more priests here than soldiers'
a piece of raillery that was literally true the number of soldiers
amounting only to 150 not one of whom is a european the whole being
mulattos of macao and goa even the officers are not all europeans
with so small a garrison it is difficult to defend four large
fortresses and the natural insolence of the chinese finds a sufficient
motive in the weakness of the military to heap insult upon insult"

just as the nadiejeda was about to weigh anchor the neva at last
appeared it was now the 3rd november and kruzenstern went up the
coast in the newly arrived vessel as far as whampoa where he sold to
advantage his cargo of furs after many prolonged discussions which his
firm but conciliating attitude together with the intervention of
english merchants brought to a successful issue

on the 9th february the two vessels once more together weighed anchor
and resumed their voyage by way of the sunda isles beyond christmas
island they were again separated in cloudy weather and did not meet
until the end of the trip on the 4th may the nadiejeda cast anchor
in st helena bay sixty days' voyage from the sunda isles and
seventy-nine from macao

"i know of no better place" says kruzenstern "to get supplies after a
long voyage than st helena the road is perfectly safe and at all
times more convenient than table bay or simon's bay at the cape the
entrance with the precaution of first getting near the land is
perfectly easy and on quitting the island nothing more is necessary
than to weigh anchor and stand out to sea every kind of provision may
be obtained here particularly the best kinds of garden stuffs and in
two or three days a ship may be provided with everything"

on the 21st april kruzenstern passed between the shetland and orkney
islands in order to avoid the english channel where he might have met
some french pirates and after a good voyage he arrived at cronstadt on
the 7th august 1806

without taking first rank like the expedition of cook or that of la
pérouse kruzenstern's trip was not without interest we owe no great
discovery to the russian explorer but he verified and rectified the
work of his predecessors this was in fact what most of the navigators
of the nineteenth century had to do the progress of science enabling
them to complete what had been begun by others

kruzenstern had taken with him in his voyage round the world the son of
the well-known dramatic author kotzebue the young otto kotzebue who
was then a cadet soon gained his promotion and he was a naval
lieutenant when in 1815 the command was given to him of the rurik a
new brig with two guns and a crew of no more than twenty-seven men
equipped at the expense of count romantzoff his task was to explore
the less-known parts of oceania and to cut a passage for his vessel
across the frozen ocean kotzebue left the port of cronstadt on the
15th july 1815 put in first at copenhagen and plymouth and after a
very trying trip doubled cape horn and entered the pacific ocean on
the 22nd january 1816 after a halt at talcahuano on the coast of
chili he resumed his voyage sighted the desert island of salas of
gomez on the 26th march and steered towards easter island where he
hoped to meet with the same friendly reception as cook and pérouse had
done before him

the russians had however hardly disembarked before they were
surrounded by a crowd eager to offer them fruit and roots by whom they
were so shamelessly robbed that they were compelled to use their arms
in self-defence and to re-embark as quickly as possible to avoid the
shower of stones flung at them by the natives

the only observation they had time to make during this short visit was
the overthrow of the numerous huge stone statues described measured
and drawn by cook and la pérouse

on the 16th april the russian captain arrived at the dog island of
schouten which he called doubtful island to mark the difference in
his estimate of its position and that attributed to it by earlier
navigators kotzebue gives it s lat 44 degrees 50 minutes and w
long 138 degrees 47 minutes

during the ensuing days were discovered the desert island of
romantzoff so named in honour of the promoter of the expedition
spiridoff island with a lagoon in the centre the island oura of the
pomautou group the vliegen chain of islets and the no less extended
group of the kruzenstern islands

on the 28th april the rurik was near the supposed site of bauman's
islands but not a sign of them could be seen and it appeared probable
that the group had in fact been one of those already visited

as soon as he was safely out of the dangerous pomautou archipelago
kotzebue steered towards the group of islands sighted in 1788 by sever
who without touching at them gave them the name of penrhyn the
russian explorer determined the position of the central group of islets
as s lat 9 degrees 1 minute 35 seconds and w long 157 degrees 44
minutes 32 seconds characterizing them as very low like those of the
pomautou group but inhabited for all that

at the sight of the vessel a considerable fleet of canoes put off from
the shore and the natives palm branches in their hands advanced with
the rhythmic sound of the paddles serving as a kind of solemn and
melancholy accompaniment to numerous singers to guard against
surprise kotzebue made all the canoes draw up on one side of the
vessel and bartering was done with a rope as the means of
communication the natives had nothing to trade with but bits of iron
and fish-hooks made of mother-of-pearl they were well made and
martial-looking but wore no clothes beyond a kind of apron

at first only noisy and very lively the natives soon became
threatening they thieved openly and answered remonstrances with
undisguised taunts brandishing their spears above their heads they
seemed to be urging each other on to an attack

when kotzebue felt that the moment had come to put an end to these
hostile demonstrations he had one gun fired in the twinkling of an
eye the canoes were empty their terrified crews unpremeditatingly
flinging themselves into the water with one accord presently the heads
of the divers reappeared and a little calmed down by the warning
received the natives returned to their canoes and their bartering
nails and pieces of iron were much sought after by these people whom
kotzebue likens to the natives of noukha-hiva they do not exactly
tatoo themselves but cover their bodies with large scars

[illustration "in the twinkling of an eye the canoes were empty"]

a curious fashion not before noticed amongst the islanders of oceania
prevails amongst them most of them wear the nails very long and those
of the chief men in the canoes extended three inches beyond the end of
the finger

thirty-six boats manned by 360 men now surrounded the vessel and
kotzebue judging that with his feeble resources and the small crew of
the rurik any attempt to land would be imprudent set sail again
without being able to collect any more information on these wild and
warlike islanders

continuing his voyage towards kamtchatka the navigator sighted on the
21st may two groups of islands connected by a chain of coral reefs he
named them kutusoff and suwaroff determined their position and made
up his mind to come back and examine them again the natives in fleet
canoes approached the rurik but in spite of the pressing invitation
of the russians would not trust themselves on board they gazed at the
vessel in astonishment talked to each other with a vivacity which
showed their intelligence and flung on deck the fruit of the
pandanus-tree and cocoa-nuts

their lank black hair with flowers fastened in it here and there the
ornaments hung round their necks their clothing of "two
curiously-woven coloured mats tied to the waist" and reaching below the
knee but above all their frank and friendly countenances
distinguished the natives of the marshall archipelago from those of
penrhyn

on the 19th june the rurik put in at new archangel and for
twenty-eight days her crew were occupied in repairing her

on the 15th july kotzebue set sail again and five days later
disembarked on behring island the southern promontory of which he laid
down in n lat 55 degrees 17 minutes 18 seconds and w long 194
degrees 6 minutes 37 seconds

the natives kotzebue met with on this island like those of the north
american coast wore clothes made of seal-skin and the intestines of
the walrus the lances used by them were pointed with the teeth of
these amphibious animals their food consisted of the flesh of whales
and seals which they store in deep cellars dug in the earth their
boats were made of leather and they had sledges drawn by dogs

their mode of salutation is strange enough they first rub each other's
noses and then pass their hands over their own stomachs as if rejoicing
over the swallowing of some tid-bit lastly when they want to be very
friendly indeed they spit in their own palms and rub their friends'
faces with the spittle

the captain still keeping his northerly course along the american
coast discovered schichmareff bay saritschiff island and lastly an
extensive gulf the existence of which was not previously known at the
end of this gulf kotzebue hoped to find a channel through which he
could reach the arctic ocean but he was disappointed he gave his own
name to the gulf and that of kruzenstern to the cape at the entrance

driven back by bad weather the rurik reached ounalashka on the 6th
september halted for a few days at san francisco and reached the
sandwich islands where some important surveys were made and some very
curious information collected

on leaving the sandwich islands kotzebue steered for suwaroff and
kutusoff islands which he had discovered a few months before on the
1st january 1817 he sighted miadi island to which he gave the name
of new year's island four days later he discovered a chain of little
low wooded islands set in a framework of reefs through which the
vessel could scarcely make its way

just at first the natives ran away at the sight of lieutenant
schischmaroff but they soon came back with branches in their hands
shouting out the word aidara (friend) the officer repeated this word
and gave them a few nails in return for which the russians received
the collars and flowers worn as neck-ornaments by the natives

this exchange of courtesies emboldened the rest of the islanders to
appear and throughout the stay of the russians in this archipelago
these friendly demonstrations and enthusiastic but guarded greetings
were continued one native rarik by name was particularly cordial to
the russians whom he informed that the name of his island and of the
chain of islets and attolls[2] connected with it was otdia in
acknowledgment of the cordial reception of the natives kotzebue left
with them a cock and hen and planted in a garden laid out under his
orders a quantity of seeds in the hope that they would thrive but in
this he did not make allowance for the number of rats which swarmed
upon these islands and wrought havoc in his plantations

[footnote 2 attolls are coral islands like circular belts surrounding
a smooth lagoon trans]

on the 6th february after ascertaining from what he was told by a
chief named languediak that these sparsely populated islands were of
recent formation kotzebue put to sea again having first christened
the archipelago romantzoff

the next day a group of islets on which only three inhabitants were
found had its name of eregup changed to that of tchitschakoff and
then an enthusiastic reception was given to kotzebue on the kawen
islands by the tamon or chief every native here fêted the new-comers
some by their silence like the queen forbidden by etiquette to answer
the speeches made to her some by their dances cries and songs in
which the name of totabou (kotzebue) was constantly repeated the chief
himself came to fetch kotzebue in a canoe and carried him on his
shoulders through the breakers to the beach

in the aur group the navigator noticed amongst a crowd of natives who
climbed on to the vessel two natives whose faces and tattooing seemed
to mark them as of alien race one of them kadu by name especially
pleased the commander who gave him some bits of iron and kotzebue was
surprised that he did not receive them with the same pleasure as his
companions this was explained the same evening when all the natives
were leaving the vessel kadu earnestly begged to be allowed to remain
on the rurik and never again to leave it the commander only yielded
to his wishes after a great deal of persuasion

"kadu" says kotzebue "had scarcely obtained permission when he
turned quickly to his comrades who were waiting for him declared to
them his intention of remaining on board the ship and distributed his
iron among the chiefs the astonishment in the boats was beyond
description they tried in vain to shake his resolution he was
immovable at last his friend edock came back spoke long and seriously
to him and when he found that his persuasion was of no avail he
attempted to drag him by force but kadu now used the right of the
strongest he pushed his friend from him and the boats sailed off his
resolution being inexplicable to me i conceived a notion that he
perhaps intended to steal during the night and privately to leave the
ship and therefore had the night-watch doubled and his bed made up
close to mine on the deck where i slept on account of the heat kadu
felt greatly honoured to sleep close to the tamon of the ship"

born at ulle one of the caroline islands more than 300 miles from the
group where he was now living kadu with edok and two other
fellow-countrymen had been overtaken when fishing by a violent
storm for eight months the poor fellows were at the mercy of the winds
and currents on a sea now smooth now rough they had never throughout
this time been without fish but they had suffered the cruelest
tortures from thirst when their stock of rain-water which they had
used very sparingly was exhausted there was nothing left to them to
do but to fling themselves into the sea and try to obtain at the bottom
of the ocean some water less impregnated with salt which they brought
to the surface in cocoa-nut shells pierced with a small opening when
they reached the aur islands even the sight of land and the immediate
prospect of safety did not rouse them from the state of prostration
into which they had sunk

the sight of the iron instruments in the canoe of the strangers led the
people of aur to decide on their massacre for the sake of their
treasures but the tamon tigedien by name took them under his
protection

three years had passed since this event and the men from the caroline
islands thanks to their more extended knowledge soon acquired a
certain ascendancy over their hosts

when the rurik appeared kadu was in the woods a long way from the
coast he was sent for at once as he was looked upon as a great
traveller and he might perhaps be able to say what the great monster
approaching the island was now kadu had more than once seen european
vessels and he persuaded his friends to go and meet the strangers and
to receive them kindly

such had been kadu's adventures he now remained on the rurik
identified the other islands of the archipelago and lost no time in
facilitating intercourse between the russians and the natives dressed
in a yellow mantle and wearing a red cap like a convict kadu looked
down upon his old friends and seemed not to recognize them when a
fine old man with a flowing beard named tigedien came on board kadu
undertook to explain to him and his companions the working of the
vessel and the use of everything about the ship like many europeans
he made up for his ignorance by imperturbable assurance and had an
answer ready for every question

interrogated on the subject of a little box from which a sailor took a
black powder and applied it to his nostrils kadu glibly told some most
extraordinary stories and wound up with a practical illustration by
putting the box against his own nose he then flung it from him
sneezing violently and screaming so loud that his terrified friends
fled away on every side but when the crisis was over he managed to
turn the incident to his own advantage

kadu gave kotzebue some general information about the group of islands
then under examination and the russians spent a month in taking
surveys &c all these islands which the natives call radack were
under the control of one tamon a man named lamary a few years later
dumont d'urville gave the name of marshall to the group according to
kadu another chain of islets attolls and reefs was situated some
little distance off on the west

kotzebue had not time to identify them and steering in a northerly
direction he reached ounalashka on the 24th april where he had to
repair the serious damage sustained by the rurik in two violent
storms this done he took on board some baidares (boats cased in skins
to make them water-tight) with fifteen natives of the aleutian
islands who were used to the navigation of the polar seas and resumed
his exploration of behring strait

kotzebue had suffered very much from pain in his chest ever since when
doubling cape horn he had been knocked down by a huge wave and flung
overboard an accident which would have cost him his life had he not
clung to some rope the consequences were so serious to his health that
when on the 10th july he landed on the island of st lawrence he was
obliged to give up the further prosecution of his researches

on the 1st october the rurik made a second short halt at the sandwich
islands where seeds and animals were landed and at the end of the
month the explorers landed at otdia in the midst of the enthusiastic
acclamations of the natives the cats brought by the visitors were
welcomed with special enthusiasm for the island was infested with
immense numbers of rats who worked havoc on the plantations great
also was the rejoicing over the return of kadu with whom the russians
left an assortment of tools and weapons which made their owner the
wealthiest inhabitant of the archipelago

[illustration interior of a house at radak (fac-simile of early
engraving)]

on the 4th november the rurik left the radak islands after
identifying the legiep group and cast anchor off guam one of the
marianne islands where she remained until the end of the month a halt
of some weeks at manilla enabled the commander to collect some curious
information about the philippine islands to which he would have to
return later

after escaping from the violent storms encountered in doubling the cape
of good hope the rurik cast anchor on the 3rd august 1818 in the
neva opposite count romantzoff's palace

these three years of absence had been turned to good account by the
hardy navigators in spite of the smallness of their number and the
poverty of their equipments they had not been afraid to face the
terrors of the deep to venture amongst all but unknown archipelagoes
or to brave the rigours of the arctic and torrid zones important as
were their actual discoveries their rectification of the errors of
their predecessors were of yet greater value two thousand five hundred
species of plants one third of which were quite new with numerous
details respecting the language ethnography religion and customs of
the tribes visited formed a rich harvest attesting the zeal skill
and knowledge of the captain as well as the intrepidity and endurance
of his crew

when therefore the russian government decided in 1823 to send
reinforcements to kamtchatka to put an end to the contraband trade
carried on in russian america the command of the expedition was given
to kotzebue a frigate called the predpriatie was placed at his
disposal and he was left free to choose his own route both going and
returning

kotzebue had gone round the world as a midshipman with kruzenstern and
that explorer now entrusted to him his eldest son as did also möller
the minister of marine a proof of the great confidence both fathers
placed in him

the expedition left cronstadt on the 15th august 1823 reached rio
janeiro in safety doubled cape horn on the 15th january 1824 and
steered for the pomautou archipelago where predpriatie island was
discovered and the islands of araktschejews romantzoff carlshoff and
palliser were identified on the 14th march anchor was cast in the
harbour of matavar otaheite

[illustration view of otaheite]

since cook's stay in this archipelago a complete transformation had
taken place in the manners and customs of the inhabitants

in 1799 some missionaries settled in otaheite where they remained for
ten years unfortunately without making a single conversion and we add
with regret without even winning the esteem or respect of the natives
compelled at the end of these ten years in consequence of the
revolutions which convulsed otaheite to take refuge at eimeo and other
islands of the same group their efforts were there crowned with more
success in 1817 pomaré king of otaheite recalled the missionaries
made them a grant of land and declared himself a convert to
christianity his example was soon followed by a considerable number of
natives

kotzebue had heard of this change but he was not prepared to find
european customs generally adopted

at the sound of the discharge announcing the arrival of the russians a
boat bearing the otaheitian flag put off from shore bringing a pilot
to guide the predpriatie to its anchorage

the next day which happened to be sunday the russians were surprised
at the religious silence which prevailed throughout the island when
they landed this silence was only broken by the sound of canticles and
psalms sung by the natives in their huts

the church a plain clean building of rectangular form roofed with
reeds and approached by a long avenue of palms was well filled with an
attentive orderly congregation the men sitting on one side the women
on the other all with prayer-books in their hands the voices of the
neophytes often joined in the chant of the missionaries unfortunately
with better will than correctness or appropriateness

if the piety of the islanders was edifying the costumes worn by these
strange converts were such as somewhat to distract the attention of the
visitors a black coat or the waistcoat of an english uniform was the
only garment worn by some whilst others contented themselves with a
jacket a shirt or a pair of trousers the most fortunate were wrapped
in cloth mantles and rich and poor alike dispensed with shoes and
stockings

the women were no less grotesquely clad some wore men's shirts white
or striped as the case might be others a mere piece of cloth but all
had european hats the wives of the areois[3] wore coloured robes a
piece of great extravagance but with them the dress formed the whole
costume

[footnote 3 the areois are a curious vagrant set of people who have
been found in these regions who practise the singular and fatal custom
of killing their children at birth because of a traditional law
binding them to do so trans]

on the monday a most imposing ceremony took place this was the visit
to kotzebue of the queen-mother and the royal family these great
people were preceded by a master of ceremonies who was a sort of court
fool wearing nothing but a red waistcoat and with his legs tattooed to
represent striped trousers whilst on the lower portion of his back was
described a quadrant divided into minute sections he performed his
absurd capers contortions and grimaces with a gravity infinitely
amusing

the queen regent carried the little king pomaré iii in her arms and
beside her walked his sister a pretty child of ten years old the
royal infant was dressed in european style like his subjects and like
them he wore nothing on his feet at the request of the ministers and
great people of otaheite kotzebue had a pair of boots made for him
which he was to wear on the day of his coronation

great were the shouts of joy the gestures of delight and the envious
exclamations over the trifles distributed amongst the ladies of the
court and fierce were the struggles for the smallest shreds of the
imitation gold lace given away

what important matter could have brought so many men on to the deck of
the frigate bearing with them quantities of fruits and figs? these
eager messengers were the husbands of the disappointed ladies of
otaheite who had not been present at the division of the gold lace more
valuable in their eyes than rivers of diamonds in those of europeans

at the end of ten days kotzebue decided to leave this strange country
where civilization and barbarism flourished side by side in a manner so
fraternal and steered for the samoa archipelago notorious for the
massacre of the companions of la pérouse

how great was the difference between the samoans and the otaheitians
wild and fierce suspicious and threatening the natives of rose island
could scarcely be kept off the deck of the predpriatie and one of
them at the sight of the bare arm of a sailor made a savage and
eloquent gesture showing with what pleasure he could devour the firm
and doubtless savoury flesh displayed to view

the insolence of the natives increased with the arrival of more canoes
from the shore and they had to be beaten back with boathooks before
the predpriatie could get away from amongst the frail boats of the
ferocious islanders

upolu or oyalava platte and pola or savai islands which with rose
island form part of the navigator or samoan group were passed almost
as soon as they were sighted and kotzebue steered for the radak
islands where he had been so kindly received on his first voyage this
time however the natives were terrified at sight of the huge vessel
and piled up their canoes or fled into the interior whilst on the
beach a procession was formed a number of islanders with palm branches
in their hands advancing to meet the intruders and beg for peace

at this sight kotzebue flung himself into a boat with the surgeon
eschscholtz and rowing rapidly towards the shore shouted "totabou
aïdara" (kotzebue friend) an immediate change was the result the
petitions the natives were going to address to the russians were
converted into shouts and enthusiastic demonstrations of delight some
rushing forwards to welcome their friend others running over to
announce his arrival to their fellow-countrymen

the commander was very pleased to find that kadu was still living at
aur under the protection of lamary whose countenance he had secured
at the price of half his wealth

of all the animals left here by kotzebue the cats now become wild
alone had survived and thus far they had not destroyed the legions of
rats with which the island was overrun

the explorer remained several days with his friends whom he
entertained with dramatic representations and on the 6th may he made
for the legiep group the examination of which he had left uncompleted
on his last voyage after surveying it he intended to resume his
exploration of the radak islands but bad weather prevented this and
he had to set sail for kamtchatka

the crew here enjoyed the rest so fully earned from the 7th june to
the 20th july when kotzebue set sail for new archangel on the american
coast where he cast anchor on the 7th august

the frigate which was here to take the place of the predpriatie was
not however ready for sea until the 1st march of the following year
and kotzebue turned the delay to account by visiting the sandwich
islands where he cast anchor off waihou in december 1824

the harbour of hono-kourou or honolulu is the safest of the
archipelago a good many vessels therefore put in there even at this
early date and the island of waihou bid fair to become the most
important of the group supplanting hawaii or owhyee the appearance of
the town was already semi-european stone houses replaced the primitive
native huts regular streets with shops café public-houses much
patronized by the sailors of whalers and fur-traders together with a
fortress provided with cannon were the most noteworthy signs of the
rapid transformation of the manners and customs of the natives

fifty years had now elapsed since the discovery of most of the islands
of oceania and everywhere changes had taken place as sudden as those
in the sandwich islands

"the fur trade" says desborough cooley carried on with the north-west
coast of america "has effected a wonderful revolution in the sandwich
islands which from their situation offered an advantageous shelter for
ships engaged in it among these islands the fur-traders wintered
refitted their vessels and replenished their stock of fresh
provisions and as summer approached returned to complete their cargo
on the coast of america iron tools and above all guns were eagerly
sought for by the islanders in exchange for their provisions and the
mercenery traders regardless of consequences readily gratified their
desires fire-arms and ammunition being the most profitable stock to
traffic with were supplied them in abundance hence the sandwich
islanders soon became formidable to their visitors they seized on
several small vessels and displayed an energy tinctured at first with
barbarity but indicating great capabilities of social improvement at
this period one of those extraordinary characters which seldom fail to
come forth when fate is charged with great events completed the
revolution which had its origin in the impulse of europeans
tame-tame-hah a chief who had made himself conspicuous during the
last and unfortunate visit of cook to those islands usurped the
authority of king subdued the neighbouring islands with an army of
16000 men and made his conquests subservient to his grand schemes of
improvement he knew the superiority of europeans and was proud to
imitate them already in 1796 when captain broughton visited those
islands the usurper sent to ask him whether he should salute him with
great guns he always kept englishmen about him as ministers and
advisers in 1817 he is said to have had an army of 7000 men armed
with muskets among whom were at least fifty europeans tame-tame-hah
who began his career in blood and usurpation lived to gain the sincere
love and admiration of his subjects who regarded him as more than
human and mourned his death with tears of warmer affection than often
bedew the ashes of royalty"

such was the state of things when the russian expedition put in at
waihou the young king rio-rio was in england with his wife and the
government of the archipelago was in the hands of the queen-mother
kaahou manou

kotzebue took advantage of the latter and of the first minister both
being absent on a neighbouring island to pay a visit to another wife
of kamea-mea

"the apartment" says the traveller "was furnished in the european
fashion with chairs tables and looking-glasses in one corner stood
an immensely large bed with silk curtains the floor was covered with
fine mats and on these in the middle of the room lay nomahanna
extended on her stomach her head turned towards the door and her arms
supported on a silk pillow nomahanna who appeared at the utmost
not more than forty years old was exactly six feet two inches high
and rather more than two ells in circumference her coal-black hair
was neatly plaited at the top of a head as round as a ball her flat
nose and thick projecting lips were certainly not very handsome yet
was her countenance on the whole prepossessing and agreeable"

the "good lady" remembered having seen kotzebue ten years before she
therefore received him graciously but she could not speak of her
husband without tears in her eyes and her grief did not appear to be
assumed in order that the date of his death should be ever-present to
her mind she had had the inscription 6th may 1819 branded on her arm

a zealous christian like most of the population the queen took
kotzebue to the church a vast but simple building not nearly so
crowded as that at otaheite nomahanna seemed to be very intelligent
she knew how to read and was specially enthusiastic about writing that
art which connects us with the absent being anxious to give the
commander a proof alike of her affection and of her acquirements she
sent him a letter by hand which it had taken her several weeks to
concoct

the other ladies did not like to be outdone and kotzebue found himself
overwhelmed with documents the only means to check this epistolatory
inundation was to weigh anchor which the captain did without loss of
time

before his departure he received queen nomahanna on board her majesty
appeared in her robes of ceremony consisting of a magnificent
peach-coloured silk dress embroidered with black evidently originally
made for a european and consequently too tight and too short for its
wearer people could therefore see not only the feet beside which
those of charlemagne would have looked like a chinaman's and which
were cased in huge men's boots but also a pair of fat brown naked
legs resembling the balustrades of a terrace a collar of red and
yellow feathers a garland of natural flowers serving as a gorget and
a hat of leghorn straw trimmed with artificial flowers completed this
fine but absurd costume

nomahanna went over the ship asking questions about everything and at
last worn out with seeing so many wonders betook herself to the
captain's cabin where a good collation was spread for her the queen
flung herself upon a couch but the fragile article of furniture was
unable to sustain so much majesty and gave way beneath the weight of a
princess whose embonpoint had doubtless had a good deal to do with
her elevation to such high rank

after this halt kotzebue returned to new archangel where he remained
until the 30th july 1825 he then paid another visit to the sandwich
islands a short time after admiral byron had brought back the remains
of the king and queen the archipelago was then at peace its
prosperity was continually on the increase the influence of the
missionaries was confirmed and the education of the young monarch was
in the hands of missionary bingham the inhabitants were deeply touched
by the honours accorded by the english to the remains of their
sovereigns and the day seemed to be not far distant when european
customs would completely supersede those of the natives

some provisions having been embarked at waihou the explorer made for
radak islands identified the pescadores forming the southern
extremity of that chain discovered the eschscholtz group a short
distance off and touched at guam on the 15th october on the 23rd
january 1826 he left manilla after a stay of some months during
which constant intercourse with the natives had enabled him to add
greatly to our knowledge of the geography and natural history of the
philippine islands a new spanish governor had arrived with a large
reinforcement of troops and had so completely crushed all agitation
that the colonists had quite given up their scheme of separating
themselves from spain

on the 10th july 1826 the predpriatie returned to cronstadt after
a voyage extending over three years during which she had visited the
north-west coast of america the aleutian islands kamtchatka and the
sea of oktoksh surveyed minutely a great part of the radak islands
and obtained fresh information on the changes through which the people
of oceania were passing thanks to the ardour of chamisso and professor
eschscholtz many specimens of natural history had been collected and
the latter published a description of more than 2000 animals as well
as some curious details on the mode of formation of the coral islands
in the south seas

the english government had now resumed with eagerness the study of the
tantalizing problem the solution of which had been sought so long in
vain we allude to the finding of the north-west passage when parry by
sea and franklin by land were trying to reach behring strait captain
frederick william beechey received instructions to penetrate as far
north as possible by way of the same strait so as to meet the other
explorers who would doubtless arrive in a state of exhaustion from
fatigue and privation

the blossom captain beechey commander set sail from spithead on the
19th may 1825 and after doubling cape horn on the 26th december
entered the pacific ocean after a short stay off the coast of chili
beechey visited easter island where the same incidents which had
marked kotzebue's visit were repeated the same eager reception on the
part of the natives who swam to the blossom or brought their paltry
merchandise to it in canoes and the same shower of stones and blows
from clubs when the english landed repulsed as in the russian
explorer's time with a rapid discharge of shot

on the 4th december captain beechey sighted an island completely
overgrown with vegetation this was the spot famous for the discovery
on it of the descendants of the mutineers of the bounty who landed
on it after the enactment of a tragedy which at the end of last
century had excited intense public interest in england

in 1781 lieutenant bligh one of the officers who had distinguished
himself under cook was appointed to the command of the bounty and
received orders to go to otaheite there to obtain specimens of the
breadfruit-tree and other of its vegetable productions for
transportation to the antilles then generally known amongst the
english as the western indies after doubling cape horn bligh cast
anchor in the bay of matavai where he shipped a cargo of
breadfruit-trees proceeding thence to ramouka one of the tonga isles
for more of the same valuable growth thus far no special incident
marked the course of the voyage which seemed likely to end happily
but the haughty character and stern despotic manners of the commander
had alienated from him the affections of nearly the whole of his crew
a plot was formed against him which was carried out before sunrise on
the 28th april off tofona

surprised by the mutineers whilst still in bed bligh was bound and
gagged before he could defend himself and dragged on deck in his
night-shirt and after a mock trial presided over by lieutenant
christian fletcher he with eighteen men who remained faithful to him
was lowered into a boat containing a few provisions and abandoned in
the open sea

after enduring agonies of hunger and thirst and escaping from terrible
storms and from the teeth of the savage natives of tofona bligh
succeeded in reaching timor island where he received an enthusiastic
welcome

"i now desired my people to come on shore" says bligh "which was as
much as some of them could do being scarce able to walk they
however were helped to the house and found tea with bread and butter
provided for their breakfast our bodies were nothing but skin and
bones our limbs were full of sores and we were clothed in rags in
this condition with the tears of joy and gratitude flowing down our
cheeks the people of timor beheld us with a mixture of horror
surprise and pity thus through the assistance of divine
providence we surmounted the difficulties and distresses of a most
perilous voyage"

perilous indeed for it had lasted no less than forty-one days in
latitudes but little known in an open boat with insufficient food
want and exposure causing infinite suffering yet in this voyage of
more than 1500 leagues but one man was lost a sailor who fell a victim
at the beginning of the journey to the natives of tofona

the fate of the mutineers was strange and more than one lesson may be
learnt from it

they made for otaheite where provisions were obtained and those who
had been least active in the mutiny were abandoned and thence
christian set sail with eight sailors who elected to remain with him
and some twenty-two natives men and women from otaheite and toubonai
nothing more was heard of them

as for those who remained at otaheite they were taken prisoners in
1791 by captain edwards of the pandora sent out by the english
government in search of them and the other mutineers with orders to
bring them to england of the ten who were brought home by the
pandora only three were condemned to death

twenty years passed by before the slightest light was thrown on the
fate of christian and those he took with him

in 1808 an american trading-vessel touched at pitcairn there to
complete her cargo of seal-skins the captain imagined the island to be
uninhabited but to his very great surprise a canoe presently
approached his ship manned by three young men of colour who spoke
english very well greatly astonished the commander questioned them
and learnt that their father had served under bligh

the fate of the latter was now known to the whole world and its
discussion had lightened the tedious hours in the forecastles of
vessels of every nationality and the american captain reminded by the
singular incident related above of the disappearance of so many of the
mutineers of the bounty landed on the island where he met an
englishman named smith who had belonged to the crew of that vessel
and who made the following confession

when he left otaheite christian made direct for pitcairn attracted to
it by its lonely situation south of the pomautou islands and out of
the general track of vessels after landing the provisions of the
bounty and taking away all the fittings which could be of any use
the mutineers burnt the vessel not only with a view to removing all
trace of their whereabouts but also to prevent the escape of any of
their number

from the first the sight of the extensive marshes led them to believe
the island to be uninhabited and they were soon convinced of the
justice of this opinion huts were built and land was cleared but the
english charitably assigned to the natives whom they had carried off
or who had elected to join them the position of slaves two years
passed by without any serious dissensions arising but at the end of
that time the natives laid a plot against the whites of which
however the latter were informed by an otaheitan woman and the two
leaders paid for their abortive attempt with their lives

two more years of peace and tranquillity ensued and then another plot
was laid this time resulting in the massacre of christian and five of
his comrades the murder however was avenged by the native women who
mourned for their english lovers and killed the surviving men of
otaheite

a little later the discovery of a plant from which a kind of brandy
could be made caused the death of one of the four englishmen still
remaining another was murdered by his companions a third died a
natural death and the last one smith took the name of adams and
lived on at the head of a community consisting of ten women and
nineteen children the eldest of whom were but seven or eight years
old

this man who had reflected on his errors and repented of them now led
a new life fulfilling the duties of father priest and sovereign his
combined firmness and justice acquiring for him an all-powerful
influence over his motley subjects

this strange teacher of morality who in his youth had set all laws at
defiance and to whom no obligation was sacred now preached pity
love and sympathy arranged regular marriages between the children of
different parents his little community thriving lustily under the mild
yet firm control of one who had but lately turned from his own evil
ways

such at the time of beechey's arrival was the state of the colony at
pitcairn the navigator well received by the inhabitants whose
virtuous conduct recalled the golden age remained amongst them
eighteen days the village consisted of clean well-built huts
surrounded by pandanus and cocoa-palms the fields were well
cultivated and under adams' tuition the young people had made
implements of agriculture of really extraordinary excellence the faces
of these half breeds were good-looking and pleasant in expression and
their figures were well-proportioned showing unusual muscular
development

[illustration "the village consisted of clean well-built huts"]

after leaving pitcairn beechey visited crescent gambier hood
clermont tonnerre serles whitsunday queen-charlotte tehaï and the
lancer islands all in the pomautou group and an islet to which he
gave the name of byam-martin

here the explorer met a native named ton-wari who had been shipwrecked
in a storm having left anaa with 500 fellow-countrymen in three canoes
to render homage to pomaré iii who had just ascended the throne
ton-wari had been driven out of his course by westerly winds these
were succeeded by variable breezes and provisions were soon so
completely exhausted that the survivors had to feed on the bodies of
those who were the first to succumb finally ton-wari arrived at barrow
island in the centre of the dangerous archipelago where he obtained a
small stock of provisions and after a long delay his canoe having
been stove in off byam-martin once more put to sea

beechey yielded under considerable persuasion to ton-wari's entreaty to
be received on board with his wife and children and taken to otaheite
the next day by one of those strange chances seldom occurring except
in fiction beechey stopped at heïon where ton-wari met his brother
who had supposed him to be long since dead after the first transports
of delight and surprise the two natives sat down side by side and
holding each others hands related their several adventures

beechey left heïon on the 10th february sighted melville and croker
islands and cast anchor on the 18th off otaheite where he had some
difficulty in obtaining provisions the natives now demanded good
chilian dollars and european clothing both of which were altogether
wanting on the blossom

after receiving a visit from the queen-mother beechey was invited to a
soirée given in his honour in the palace at papeïti when the english
arrived however they found everybody sound asleep the hostess having
forgotten all about her invitation and gone to bed earlier than usual
she received her guests none the less cordially however and organized
a little dance in spite of the remonstrances of the missionaries only
the fête had to be conducted so to speak in silence that the noise
might not reach the ears of the police on duty on the beach from this
incident we can guess the amount of liberty the missionary pritchard
allowed to the most exalted personages of otaheite what must the
discipline then have been for the common herd of the natives

on the 3rd april the young king paid a visit to beechey who gave him
on behalf of the admiralty a fine fowling-piece very friendly was the
intercourse which ensued and the good influence the english
missionaries had obtained was strengthened by the cordiality and tact
of the ship's officers

leaving otaheite on the 26th april beechey reached the sandwich
islands where he remained some ten days and then set sail for behring
strait and the arctic ocean his instructions were to skirt along the
north american coast as far as the state of the ice would permit the
blossom made a halt in kotzebue bay a desolate forbidding and
inhospitable spot where the english had several interviews with the
natives without obtaining any information about franklin and his
people at last beechey sent forward one of the ship's boats under
command of lieutenant elson to seek the intrepid explorer elson was
however unable to pass point barrow (n lat 71 degrees 23 minutes)
and was compelled to return to the blossom which in her turn was
driven back to the entrance of the strait by the ice on the 13th
october the weather being clear and the frost of extreme severity

in order to turn to account the winter season beechey visited san
francisco and cast anchor yet again off honolulu in the sandwich
islands thanks to the liberal and enlightened policy of the
government this archipelago was now rapidly growing in prosperity the
number of houses had increased the town was gradually acquiring a
european appearance the harbour was frequented by numerous english and
american vessels and a national navy numbering five brigs and eight
schooners had sprung into being agriculture was in a flourishing
condition coffee tea spices were cultivated in extensive
plantations and efforts were being made to utilize the luxuriant
sugar-cane forests native to the archipelago

after a stay in april at the mouth of the canton river the explorers
surveyed the liu-kiu archipelago a chain of islands connecting japan
with formosa and the bonin-sima group districts in which no animals
were seen but big green turtles

this exploration over the blossom resumed her northerly course but
the atmospheric conditions were less favourable than before and it was
impossible this time to penetrate further than n lat 70 degrees 40
minutes beechey left provisions clothes and instructions on the
coast in this neighbourhood in case parry or franklin should get as
far the explorer then cruised about until the 6th october when he
decided with the greatest regret to return to england he touched at
monterey san francisco san-blas and valparaiso doubled cape horn
cast anchor at rio de janeiro and finally arrived off spithead on the
21st october

[illustration a morai at kayakakoua (fac-simile of early engraving)]

we must now give an account of the expedition of the russian captain
lütke which was fruitful of most important results the explorer's own
relation of his adventures is written in a most amusing and spirited
style and from it we shall therefore quote largely

the seniavine and the möller were two transport ships built in
russia both of which were good sea-going boats the latter however
was a very slow sailer which unfortunately kept the two vessels apart
for the greater part of the voyage lütke commanded the seniavine
and stanioukowitch the möller

the two vessels set sail from cronstadt on the 1st september 1828 and
touched at copenhagen and plymouth where scientific instruments were
purchased hardly had they left the channel before they were separated
the seniavine whose movements we shall most particularly follow
touched at teneriffe where lütke hoped to meet his consort

from the 4th to the 8th november teneriffe had been devastated by a
terrific storm such as had not been seen since the conquest three
vessels had perished in the very roadstead of santa cruz and two
others thrown upon the coast had gone to pieces torrents swollen by a
tremendous downpour had destroyed gardens walls and buildings laid
waste plantations all but demolished one fort swept down a number of
houses in the town and rendered several streets impassable three or
four hundred persons had met their deaths in this convulsion of nature
and the damage done was estimated at several millions of piastres

in january the two vessels met again at rio de janeiro and kept
together as far as cape horn where they encountered the usual storms
and fogs and were again separated the seniavine then made for
conception

"on the 15th may" says lütke "we were not more than eight miles from
the nearest coast but a dense fog hid it from us in the night this
fog lifted and at daybreak a scene of indescribable grandeur and
magnificence met our eyes the serrated chain of the andes with its
pointed peaks stood out against an azure blue sky lit up by the first
rays of the morning sun i will not add to the number of those who have
exhausted themselves in vain efforts to transmit to others their own
sensations at the first sight of such scenes they are as indescribable
as the majesty of the scene itself the variety of the colours the
light which as the sun rose gradually spread over the sky and the
clouds were alike of inimitable beauty to our great regret this
spectacle like everything most sublime in nature did not last long
as the atmosphere became flooded with light the huge masses of clouds
seemed with one accord to plunge into the deep and the sun appearing
above the horizon removed every trace of them"

lütke's opinion of conception does not agree with that of some of his
predecessors he had not yet forgotten the exuberant richness of the
vegetation of the bay of rio de janeiro so that he found this new
coast poor as far as he could judge during a very short stay the
inhabitants were more affable and civilized than the people of the same
class in many other countries

when he reached valparaiso lütke met the möller setting sail for
kamtchatka the crews bid each other good-bye and thenceforth the two
vessels took different directions

the first excursion of the officers and naturalists of lütke's party
was to the celebrated "quebradas"

"these" says the explorer "are ravines in the mountains crowded so
to speak with the little huts containing the greater part of the people
of valparaiso the most densely populated of these 'quebradas' is that
rising at the south-west corner of the town the granite which is
there laid bare serves as a strong foundation for the buildings and
protects them from the destructive effects of earthquakes
communication between the town and the different houses is carried on
by means of narrow paths without supports or steps which are carried
along the slopes of the rocks and on which the children play and run
about like chamois the few houses here belong to foreigners little
paths lead up to them and some have steps which the chilians look
upon as a superfluous and altogether useless luxury a staircase of
tiled or palm-branch roofs below and above an amphitheatre of gates and
gardens present a curious spectacle at first i kept up with the
naturalists but they presently brought me to a place where i could not
advance or retire a step which decided me to return with one of my
officers and to leave them there with a hearty wish that they might
bring their heads back safely to our lodgings as for myself i expected
to lose mine a thousand times before i got down again"

on their return from an arduous excursion a few leagues from
valparaiso the marines were astonished at being arrested as they rode
into the town by a patrol who in spite of their remonstrances
compelled them to dismount

"it was holy thursday" says lütke "and from that day to holy saturday
no one is here permitted under pain of a severe penalty either to ride
sing dance play on any instrument or wear a hat all business work
and amusement are strictly forbidden during that time the hill in the
centre of the town with the theatre upon it is converted for the time
being into a golgotha in the centre of a railed-in space rises a
crucifix with numerous tapers and flowers about it and female figures
kneeling on either side representing the witnesses of the passion of
our lord pious souls come here to obtain absolution from their sins by
loud prayers i saw none but female penitents not a single man was
there amongst them most of them were doubtless very certain of
obtaining the divine favour for they came up playing and laughing
only assuming a contrite air when close to the object of their
devotion before which they knelt for a few minutes resuming their
pranks and laughter again directly they turned away"

the intolerance and superstition met with by the visitors at every turn
made the explorer reflect deeply he regretted seeing so much force and
so many resources which might have promoted the intellectual progress
and material prosperity of the country wasted on perpetual revolutions

to lütke nothing less resembled a valley of paradise than valparaiso
and its environs rugged mountains broken by deep quebradas a sandy
plain in the centre of which rises the town with the lofty heights of
the andes in the background do not strictly speaking form an eden

the traces of the terrible earthquake of 1823 were not yet entirely
effaced and here and there large spaces covered with ruins were still
to be seen

on the 15th april the seniavine set sail for new archangel where
she arrived on the 24th june after a voyage unmarked by any special
incident the necessity for repairing the effects of the wear and tear
of a voyage of ten months and of disembarking the provisions for the
company of which the seniavine was the bearer detained captain lütke
in the bay of sitka for five weeks

this part of the coast of north america presents a wild but picturesque
appearance lofty mountains clothed to their very peaks with dense and
gloomy forests form the background of the picture at the entrance of
the bay rises mount edgecumbe an extinct volcano 2800 feet above the
sea-level on entering the bay the visitor finds himself in a labyrinth
of islands behind which rise the fortress towers and church of new
archangel which consists of but one row of houses with gardens a
hospital a timber-yard and outside the palisades a large village of
kaloche indians at this time the population consisted of a mixture of
russians creoles and aleutians numbering some 800 altogether of
whom three-eighths were in the service of the company this population
however fluctuates very much according to the season in the summer
almost every one is away at the chase and no sooner does autumn bring
the people before they are all off again fishing

new archangel does not offer too many attractions in the way of
amusements truth to tell it is one of the dullest places imaginable
inexpressibly gloomy where autumn seems to reign all through the year
except for three months when snow falls continuously all this
however does not of course affect the passing visitor and for the
resident there is nothing to keep up his spirits but a good stock of
philosophy or a stern determination not to die of hunger there is a
good deal of remunerative trade with california the natives and
foreign vessels

the chief furs obtained by aleutians who hunt for the company are those
of the otter the beaver the fox and the souslic the natives also
hunt the walrus seal and whale not to speak of the herring the cod
salmon turbot lote perch and tsouklis a shell fish found in queen
charlotte's islands used by the company as a medium of exchange with
the americans

as for these americans they seem to be all of one race between the 46th
and 60th degrees of n lat such at least is the conclusion to which
we are led by the study of their manners customs and languages

the kaloches of sitka claim a man of the name of elkh as the founder of
their race favoured by the protection of the raven first cause of all
things[4] strange to say this bird also plays an important part
amongst the kadiaks who are esquimaux according to lütke the
kaloches have a tradition of a deluge and some fables which recall
those of the greek mythology

[footnote 4 the raven was regarded by these races with superstitious
dread as having the power of healing diseases &c trans]

their religion is nothing more than a kind of chamanism or belief in
the power of the chamans or magicians to ward off diseases &c they do
not recognize a supreme god but they believe in evil spirits and in
sorcerers who foretell the future heal the sick and transmit their
office from father to son

they believe the soul to be immortal and that the spirits of their
chieftains do not mix with those of the common people slaves are
slaves still after death the far from consolatory nature of this creed
is obvious the government is patriarchal the natives are divided into
tribes the members of which have the figures of animals as signs
after which they are also sometimes named we meet for instance with
the wolf the raven the bear the eagle &c

the slaves of the kaloches are prisoners taken in war and very
miserable is their lot their masters hold the power of life and death
over them in some ceremonies that on the death of a chief for
instance the slaves who are no longer of use are sacrificed or else
their liberty is given to them[5]

[footnote 5 the aim being to give up the slaves as property it was a
matter of indifference whether they were killed or set at
liberty trans]

suspicious and crafty cruel and vindictive the kaloches are neither
better nor worse than the neighbouring tribes hardened to fatigue
brave but idle they leave all the housework to their wives of whom
they have many polygamy being an institution amongst them

on leaving sitka lütke made for ounalashka ilioluk is the chief
trading establishment on that island but it only contains some twelve
russians and ten aleutians of both sexes

this island has a good many productions which tend to make life pass
pleasantly it is rich in good pastures and cattle-breeding is largely
carried on but it is almost entirely wanting in timber the
inhabitants being obliged to pick up the débris flung up by the sea
which sometimes includes whole trunks of cypress camphor-trees and a
kind of wood which smells like roses

at the time of lütke's visit the people of the fox islands had adopted
to a great extent russian manners and costumes they were all
christians the aleutians are a hardy kind-hearted agile race almost
living on the sea

since 1826 several eruptions of lava have caused terrible devastation
in these islands in may 1827 the shishaldin volcano opened a new
crater and vomited forth flames

lütke's instructions obliged him to explore st matthew's island which
cook had called gore island the hydrographical survey was successful
beyond the highest expectations but the russians could do nothing
towards learning anything of the natural history of the island for
they were not allowed to land at all

in the meantime the winter with its usual storms and fogs was rapidly
drawing on it was of no use hoping to get to behring strait and lütke
therefore made for kamtchatka after touching at behring island he
remained three weeks at petropaulovsky which he employed in landing
his cargo and preparing for his winter campaign

lütke's instructions were now to spend the winter in the exploration of
the caroline islands he decided to go first to ualan island which had
been discovered by the french navigator duperrey here a safe harbour
enabled him to make some experiments with the pendulum

on his way lütke sought in vain for colonnas island in n lat 26
degrees 9 minutes w long 128 degrees he was equally unsuccessful in
his search for dexter and st bartholomew islands though he identified
the brown coral group discovered by butler in 1794 and arrived safely
off ualan on the 4th december

from the first the relations between the natives of this island and the
russians were extremely satisfactory many of the former came on board
and showed so much confidence in their visitors as to remain all night
though the vessel was still in motion

it was only with great difficulty that the seniavine entered coquille
harbour following the example of duperrey who had set up his
observatory on the islet of matanial lütke landed there and took his
observations whilst his people traded with the natives who were
throughout his stay peaceful friendly and civil to check their
thieving propensities however a chief was kept as a hostage for a
couple of days and one canoe was burnt these new measures being
completely successful

"we are glad to be able to declare in the face of the world" says
lütke "that our stay of three weeks at ualan cost not a drop of human
blood but that we were able to leave these friendly islanders without
enlightening them further on the use of our fire-arms which they
looked upon as suitable only for the killing of birds i don't think
there is another instance of the kind in the records of any previous
voyages in the south seas"

[illustration native of ualan (fac-simile of early engraving)]

after leaving ualan lütke had a vain search for the musgrave islands
marked on kruzenstern's map and soon discovered a large island
surrounded by a coral reef which had escaped the notice of duperrey
and is known as puinipet or pornabi some very large and fine canoes
each manned by fourteen men and some smaller ones worked by two
natives only soon surrounded the vessel their inmates with fierce
faces and blood-shot eyes were noisy and blustering and did a good
deal of shouting gesticulating and dancing before they could make up
their minds to trust themselves on board the seniavine

it would have been impossible to land except by force as the native
canoes completely surrounded the vessel and when an attempt at
disembarkation was made the savages surrounded the ship's boat only
retiring before the warlike attitude of the sailors and a volley from
the guns of the seniavine

lütke had not time to examine thoroughly his discovery to which he
gave the name of the seniavine archipelago the information he
collected on the people of the puinipet islands is therefore not very
trustworthy according to him they do not belong to the same race as
those of ualan but resemble rather the papuans the nearest of whom
are those of new ireland seven hundred miles away

after another vain search this time for saint augustine's island he
sighted the cora of los vaherites also called seven or raven island
discovered in 1773 by the spaniard felipe tompson

the navigator next saw the mortlock archipelago the old lugunor group
known to torrés as the lugullos the people of which resemble those of
ualan he landed on the principal of these islands which he found to
be one huge garden of cocoa palms and breadfruit-trees

the natives enjoy a centre degree of civilization they weave and dye
the fibres of the banana and cocoa-nut palms as do those of ualan and
puinipet their fishing-tackle does credit to their inventive
faculties especially a sort of case constructed of small sticks and
split bamboo-canes which the fish cannot get out of when once in they
also use nets of the shape of large wallets lines and harpoons

their canoes in which they spend more than half their lives are
wonderfully adapted to their requirements the large ones which are a
very great trouble to build and which are kept in sheds constructed
specially for them are twenty-six feet long two and a half wide and
four deep they are furnished with gimbals the cross-pieces being
connected by a rafter on the other side there is a small platform
four feet square and furnished with a roof under which they are
accustomed to keep their provisions these pirogues have a triangular
sail which is made of matting woven from bandanus leaves and is
attached to two yards in tacking about they drop the sail and turn
the mast towards the other end of the canoe to which at the same
time they have passed the fastening of the sail so that the pirogue
moves forward by its other extremity

lütke next sighted the namuluk group the inhabitants of which do not
differ at all from the people of lugunor and he proved the identity of
hogolu island already described by duperrey with quirosa he then
visited the namnuïto group the first stratum of a number of islands
or of one large island which will some day exist in this part of the
world

lütke who was in want of biscuits and other articles which he hoped
to obtain at guam or from vessels at anchor in that port now set sail
for the marianne islands where he counted upon being able to repeat
some new experiments with the pendulum in which freycinet had found an
important anomaly of gravitation[6]

[footnote 6 "from numerous experiments" says freycinet "with the
pendulum collected at our observatory at agagna in lat 13 degrees 27
minutes 511 seconds 5 n  at the level of the sea and with the
thermometer at +20 degrees centig we were shown that the pendulum
which in the same circumstances would make at paris 86400
oscillations in 24 mean solar hours would here make 86295 ^osc 013 in
the same time" trans]

great however was his surprise when he arrived to find not a sign of
life at guam no flags waved above the two ports the silence of death
reigned everywhere and but for the presence of a schooner at anchor in
the inner harbour it might have been a desert island there was hardly
anybody about on shore and the few people there were were half savage
from whom it was all but impossible to obtain the slightest
information fortunately an english deserter came and offered his
services to lütke who sent him to the governor with a letter which
elicited a satisfactory reply

the governor was the same medinella whose hospitality had been lauded
by kotzebue and freycinet there was therefore no difficulty in
obtaining permission to set up an observatory and to take to it the
necessary provisions the stay at guam was however saddened by an
accident to lütke who wounded himself severely in the thumb with his
own gun when hunting

the repairing and refitting of the seniavine with the taking in of
wood and water delayed the explorer at guam until the 19th march
during this time lütke was able to verify the information collected ten
years ago by freycinet in his stay of two months in the governor's own
house things had not changed at all since the french traveller's
visit

as it was not yet time to go north lütke made for the caroline
islands viâ the swedes islands the inhabitants seemed to him to be
better made than their neighbours on the west from whom however they
differ in no other particulars the faraulep ulie ifuluk and euripeg
islands were successively examined and on the 27th april the explorer
started for the bonin islands where he learnt that his exploration of
that group had been anticipated by beechey he therefore took no
hydrographical surveys two of the crew of a whaling-vessel which had
been shipwrecked on the coast were still living at bonin sima

since the rise of the great fisheries this archipelago has been
frequented by numerous whalemen who here find a safe port at all
seasons plenty of wood and water turtles for six months of the year
fish and immense quantities of anti-scorbutic plants including the
delicious savoy cabbage

"the majestic height and the vigour of the trees" says lütke "the
productions of the tropical and temperate zones alternating with each
other bear witness at once to the fertility of the soil and the
salubrity of the climate most of our vegetables and pot-herbs
perhaps indeed all of them would certainly flourish well as would
also wheat rice and maize nor could a better climate be desired for
the cultivation of the vine domestic animals of every kind and bees
would multiply rapidly in a word a small and industrious colony would
shortly convert this little group into a fertile and flourishing
settlement"

on the 9th june after a week's delay for want of wind the seniavine
entered petropaulovsky where it was retained taking in provisions
until the 26th a whole series of surveys were taken during this
interval of the coasts of kamtchatka and of the kodiak and tchouktchi
districts interrupted however by visits to karaghinsk island the
bay of st lawrence and the gulf of santa cruz

during one of these visits the captain met with a strange adventure
he had been for several days on a friendly footing with the
tchouktchis whose knowledge of the people and customs of russia he
endeavoured to increase

"these natives" he says "were friendly and polite and endeavoured to
pay back our jokes and tricks in our own coin i softly patted the
cheek of a sturdy tchouktchi as a sign of kindly feeling and suddenly
received in return a box on the ear which knocked me down recovered
from my astonishment there i saw my tchouktchi with a laughing face
looking like a man who has just given proof of his politeness and tact
he too had meant to give me merely a gentle tap but it was with a hand
only accustomed to deal with reindeer"

the travellers were also witnesses of some proofs of the skill of a
tchouktchi conjurer or chaman who went behind a curtain from which
his audience soon heard a voice like the howl of a wild beast
accompanied by blows on a tambourine with a whale-bone the curtain
then rose revealing the sorcerer balancing himself and accompanying
his own voice with blows on his drum which he held close to his ear
presently he flung off his jacket leaving himself naked to the waist
took a polished stone which he gave to lütke to hold took it away
again and as he passed one hand over the other the stone disappeared
then showing a tumour on his shoulder he pretended that the stone was
in it turned over the tumour extracted the stone from it and
prophesied a favourable issue of the journey of the russians

the conjuror was congratulated on his skill and a knife was given to
him as a token of gratitude taking this knife in his hand he put out
his tongue and began to cut it his mouth became full of blood and he
finally cut a piece of his tongue off and held the piece out in his
hand here the curtain fell probably because the skill of the
professor of legerdemain could go no further

the people inhabiting the north-east corner of asia are known under the
general name of tchouktchis this includes two races one nomad like
the samoyedes called the reindeer tchouktchis the other living in
fixed habitations called the sedentary tchouktchis the mode of life
the physiognomy and the very language of these two races differ the
idiom spoken by the sedentary tchouktchis has great affinity with that
of the esquimaux whom they also resemble in their mode of building
their huts and leather boats and in the instruments they use

[illustration sedentary tchouktchis]

lütke did not see many reindeer tchouktchis so that he could add
nothing to the information obtained by his predecessors he was of
opinion however that they had been painted in unfairly gloomy
colours and that their turbulence and wildness had been grossly
exaggerated

the sedentary tchouktchis generally called namollos spend the winter
in sheds and the summer in huts covered with skins the latter usually
each serve for several families

"the sons and their wives the daughters and their husbands" says the
narrative "live together with their parents and vice versâ each
family occupies one division of the back part of the hut curtained off
from the others the curtains are made of reindeer-skins sewn into the
shape of a bell they are fastened to the beams of the ceiling and
reach to the ground with the aid of the grease they burn in cold
weather two three and sometimes more persons so warm the air with
their breath in these hermetically sealed positions that all clothing
is superfluous even with the severest frost but only tchouktchi lungs
are fitted to respire in such an atmosphere in the outer part of the
hut cooking-utensils pottery baskets seal-skin trunks &c are
kept here too is the hearth if we can so call the spot where burn a
few sticks of brushwood painfully collected in the marsh or when they
are not to be obtained whale-bones floating in grease round about the
hut on wooden dryers black and disgusting looking pieces of seal's
flesh are exposed to view" these people lead a miserable life they
feed upon the half-raw flesh of seals and walruses hunted by
themselves or on that of whales flung up by the waves on the beach
the dog is the only domestic animal they possess and they treat it
badly enough although the poor creatures are very affectionate and
render them great services now towing along their canoes now dragging
their sledges over the snow

after a second stay of five weeks at petropaulovski the seniavine
left kamtchatka on the 10th of november on its way back to europe
before reaching manilla lütke made a cruise in the northern part of
the caroline archipelago which he had not had time to visit during the
preceding winter he saw in succession the islands of marileu falulu
faïu namuniuto magur faraulep eap mogmog and found at manilla the
sloop the möller which was waiting his arrival

the caroline archipelago embraces an immense space and the marianne
islands as well as the radak group might fitly be included in it as
containing a population perfectly identical in race for a long time
the old geographers had had for their guidance only the charts of
missionaries who lacking alike the education and the appliances
necessary to estimate accurately the size position and relative
distance of all these archipelagoes had attached notable importance to
them and often fixed at a considerable number of degrees the extent of
a group which covered only a few miles

thus navigators accepted their guidance with wise caution freycinet
was the first to infuse a little order into this chaos and thanks to
his meeting with kadu and don louis torrès he was able to identify
later with earlier discoveries lütke did his part and that not a
small part in the settling of an accurate and scientific chart of an
archipelago which had long been the terror of navigators

the learned russian explorer is not of the same opinion as lesson one
of his predecessors who connected all the inhabitants of the caroline
group with the mongolian race under the name of the "mongolo-pelagian"
branch he rather sees in them as did chamisso and balbi a branch of
the malay family which has peopled eastern polynesia whilst lesson
compares the people of the carolines with the chinese and japanese
lütke on the other hand finds in their great projecting eyes thick
lips and retroussé nose a family likeness to the people of the
sandwich and tonga islands the language does not suggest the slightest
comparison with japanese whilst it shows a great resemblance to that
of the tonga islands

lütke spent the time of his sojourn at manilla in laying in stores and
repairing the sloop and on the 30th of january he left that spanish
possession for russia which he reached on the 6th of september 1829
casting anchor in the roads of cronstadt

it remains now to tell how it had fared with the sloop the möller
after the separation at valparaiso arriving at kamtchatka from
otaheite she had left part of her cargo at petropaulovski and
thereafter in august 1827 had set sail for ounalashka where she had
remained for a month after an examination of the west coast of
america which was cut short by unfavourable weather and a stay at
honolulu which extended to february 1828 she had discovered the
island möller noted the necker gardner and lisiansky islands and
marked at a distance of six miles southwards a very dangerous reef

the sloop had then coasted the island of curè the french frigate shoal
the reef maro pearl island and the isle of hermes and after having
made search for several islands marked upon arrowsmith's charts had at
length reached kamtchatka at the end of april she had set sail for
ounalashka and taken observations of the north coast of the alaska
peninsula in september the möller rejoined the seniavine and
from that period until their return to russia they were no more
separated save for brief intervals

as one may judge from the sufficiently detailed account which has just
been given this expedition did not fail to bring about results of
importance to geographical science we must add that the different
branches of natural history physics and astronomy owe to it equally
numerous and important additions

chili the araucanians discoveries in the dangerous archipelago stay
at otaheite and new ireland the papuans stay at ualan the caroline
islands and their inhabitants scientific results of the expeditions


the expedition under the command of louis claude de saulces de
freycinet was the result of the leisure which the peace of 1815 brought
to the french navy the idea was started by one of its most adventurous
officers the same who had accompanied baudin in his survey of the
australian coasts and to him was entrusted the task of carrying it
out it was the first voyage which had not hydrography alone for its
object its chief aim was to survey the shape of the land in the
southern hemisphere and to make observations in terrestrial magnetism
without at the same time omitting to give attention to all natural
phenomena and to the manners customs and languages of indigenous
races purely geographical inquiries though not altogether omitted
from the programme had the least prominent place in it

among the medical officers of the navy freycinet found mm quoy
gaimard and gaudichaud whose attainments in natural history qualified
them for being valuable coadjutors and he also chose to accompany him
several distinguished officers who had risen to high rank in the navy
the best known being duperrey lamarche berard and odet-pellion who
subsequently became one a member of the institute the others superior
officers or admirals

no less care was exercised by freycinet in composing his crew chiefly
of sailors who were also skilled in some trade so that out of the 120
men who manned the corvette uranie no less than fifty could serve on
occasion as carpenters ropemakers sailmakers blacksmiths or other
mechanics

the uranie amply supplied with stores for two years and provided
with all sorts of apparatus of proved utility iron cisterns for fresh
water machines for distilling salt water preserved provisions
remedies for scurvy &c at last on the 17th of september 1817 she
set sail from toulon on board disguised as a sailor was the
commander's wife who was not to be deterred from joining her husband
by the dangers and hardships of so protracted a voyage

together with all these provisions for bodily comfort freycinet took
with him a stock of the best scientific instruments together with
minute instructions from the institute intended to direct his
researches and to suggest the experiments best adapted to promote the
progress of science

the uranie reached rio de janeiro on the 6th of december having put
in at gibraltar and made a short stay at teneriffe one of the
canaries which as freycinet wittily observes were not fortunate
islands for his crew all communication with the land being forbidden
by the governors

during their stay at rio de janeiro the officers took a great many
magnetical observations and made experiments with the pendulum whilst
the naturalists scoured the country for new specimens and curiosities
making large and important collections

the original records of the voyage contain a long narrative of the
discovery and colonization of brazil and detailed information on the
customs and manners of the people on the temperature and the climate
as well as a minute description of the principal buildings and the
suburbs of rio de janeiro itself the most curious part of this account
is that which touches upon the gipsies who at that time were to be
met with at rio de janeiro

"worthy descendants of the pariahs of india whence these gipsies
without doubt originally came" says freycinet "they are noted like
their ancestors for every vicious practice and criminal propensity
most of them possessing immense wealth make a great display in dress
and in horses especially at their weddings which are celebrated with
much expense and they find their chief pleasure either in riotous
debauchery or in sheer idleness knaves and liars they cheat as much
as they can in trade and are also clever smugglers here as
elsewhere these detestable people intermarry only among their own
race they speak a jargon of their own with a peculiar accent the
government most unaccountably tolerates the nuisance of their presence
and goes so far as to appropriate to their exclusive use two streets in
the neighbourhood of the campo de santa anna"

a little further on the traveller remarks 

"any one who saw rio de janeiro only by day would come to the
conclusion that the population consisted entirely of negroes the
respectable classes never go out except in the evening unless
compelled by some pressing circumstance or for the performance of
religious duties and it is in the evening that the ladies especially
show themselves during the day all remain indoors and pass the time
between their couches and their looking-glasses the only places where
a man can enjoy the society of the ladies are the theatres and the
churches"

during the sail from brazil to the cape of good hope nothing occurred
deserving special mention on the 7th march the uranie anchored in
table bay after a quarantine of three days the travellers obtained
permission to land and were received with a hearty welcome by governor
somerset as soon as a place suitable for their reception had been
found the scientific instruments were brought on shore and the usual
experiments were made with the pendulum and the variations of the
magnetic needle observed

mm quoy and gaimard the naturalists in company with several officers
of the staff made scientific excursions to table mountain and to the
famous vineyards of constantia m gaimard observes "the vines that we
rode amongst are in the midst of alleys of oak and of pine and the
vine-stems planted at the distance of four feet from one another are
not supported by props every year the vines are pruned and the earth
about them which is of a sandy nature is turned up we noticed here
and there plenty of peaches apricots apples pears citrons as well
as small plots cultivated as kitchen-gardens on our return m colyn
insisted on our tasting the several sorts of wine which he
produces constantia properly so-called both red and white pontac
pierre and frontignac the wine produced in other localities which is
called cape wine par excellence is manufactured from a muscatel
grape of a dark straw colour which seemed to me in flavour preferable
to the grape of provence we have just said that there are two sorts of
constantia the red and the white they are both produced from muscatel
grapes of different colours people at the cape generally prefer
frontignac to all the other wines produced from the vintages of
constantia"

exactly a month after quitting the southern extremity of africa the
uranie cast anchor off port louis in the isle of france which since
the treaties of 1815 has been in the hands of the english the
necessity for careening the ship that it might be thoroughly examined
and the copper sheathing repaired led to a much longer stay in this
port than freycinet had calculated upon but our travellers found no
cause to regret the delay for the society of port louis fully
sustained its old reputation for generous hospitality the time passed
quickly in excursions receptions dinners balls horse-races and all
sorts of festivities it was therefore not without some regret that
the french guests bade adieu to a place where they had been received
with so much kindness both by their old compatriots and by those who
had so lately been their bitter enemies

the stay of the uranie at the isle of france had not however been
sufficiently long to allow freycinet to investigate many subjects of
much interest but this omission was remedied by the polite readiness
shown by some of the leading residents in supplying him with valuable
papers on the agriculture of the island its commerce its financial
position the industrial pursuits and the social condition of the
people the correct appreciation of which demanded a more careful and
minute examination than a mere passing traveller could possibly give to
them since the island had come under english administration it
appeared that a number of new roads had been planned out and a policy
of reform had supplanted a benumbing system of routine fatal to all
activity and progress

bourbon was the next place touched at by the uranie where the
supplies of which the travellers stood in need were to be procured from
the government stores she cast anchor off st denis on the 19th july
1818 remaining in the roadstead of st paul until the 2nd august when
she set sail for the bay of sharks on the western shores of australia
there is little of interest to be noted in connexion with the stay at
bourbon beyond the steady increase of the population and of trade which
had taken place during the century preceding the arrival of the french
expedition in 1717 according to gentil de barbinais there were living
in the island only 900 free people amongst whom were no more than six
white families and 1100 slaves at the last census taken in 1817
these numbers had risen to 14790 whites 4342 free blacks 49759
slaves making a total of 68898 inhabitants this large and rapid
increase must be attributed partly to the salubrity of the climate but
chiefly to the freedom of trade of which the island had for some time
enjoyed the advantage

after a fortunate voyage of forty days the uranie cast anchor at the
entrance of the bay of sharks on the 12th september a party was at
once despatched to dirk hartog in order to determine the latitude and
longitude of cape levaillant and to bring on board the corvette a
certain metal plate which had been left there by the dutch at a remote
period and had been seen by freycinet in 1801 whilst this party were
away the two alembics were set to work to distil sea-water which was
effected so successfully that as long as the vessel stayed there no
other water was drunk but that obtained by this process and all on
board were satisfied with it

on landing the party sent to dirk hartog got a view of the natives
who were armed with javelins and clubs but had not a vestige of
clothing they however refused to have any close communications with
the white strangers keeping themselves at a respectful distance and
not handling any of the presents offered them without a previous
careful inspection

although the bay of sharks had been minutely explored at the time of
the expedition under baudin there still remained a hydrographical gap
to be filled up on the eastern side of hamelin bay accordingly
duperrey proceeded there to complete the survey of that part of the
coast at the same time gaimard the naturalist not disposed to rest
satisfied with the interviews which as yet he had been able to obtain
with the natives of the country whom the sound of the fire-arms had
summarily dispersed decided upon penetrating into the interior to
gain some information respecting their mode of life his companion and
himself lost their way as also did riche in 1792 upon nuyt's land
where for three days they underwent severe sufferings from thirst not
being able to find a single rivulet or spring in the country

the expedition were well pleased when the inhospitable shores of
endracht disappeared from view they had a pleasant passage in lovely
weather and over an unruffled sea to the island of timor where on
the 9th october the uranie cast anchor in the roadstead of coupang
and the travellers met with a cordial reception from the portuguese
authorities but they found that the prosperity which had made the
colony an object of wonder and admiration to the french travellers who
had visited it with baudin had passed away the rajah of amanoubang
the district where the sandal-tree grows in such abundance who was
formerly a tributary prince was carrying on war to gain independence
the hostilities which were proceeding were not only detrimental to the
interests of the colony but also made it very difficult for freycinet
to purchase the commodities of which he stood in need some of the
staff set off to pay a visit to the rajah peters de banacassi whose
residence was not more than three-quarters of a league from coupang
peters then eighty years of age must have been a remarkably fine man
he gave them an audience surrounded by his attendants who treated him
with profound respect and among whom were conspicuous several warriors
of gigantic stature the dwelling that served for the royal palace was
rudely constructed yet the french travellers saw with lively surprise
that articles of luxury were plentiful and they observed also some
muskets of good manufacture and great value

notwithstanding the excessive heat of the climate the thermometer
rising in the open air to 45 degrees and in the shade to 33 degrees
and even to 35 degrees the commander and his officers carried on with
unremitting zeal the observations and surveys which it was the object
of the expedition to make a few fell victims to their own imprudence
for in defiance of the earnest warnings of freycinet some of the young
officers and the seamen chose to sally forth in the middle of the day
and with the view of fortifying themselves against the injurious
effects of their dangerous freak drank and ate plentifully of cold
water and sour fruits the result was that in a short time five of the
most imprudent were confined to their hammocks with dysentery this
necessitated a departure from timor so the uranie weighed anchor and
set sail on the 23rd october

at first the corvette sailed rapidly along the north coast of timor
for the purpose of making a survey but when she had reached the
narrowest part of the channel of ombay she encountered such violent
currents that the winds being slight and contrary it was only with
great difficulty she was able to regain the course which she had lost
during the calm no less than nineteen days were wasted in this trying
situation though certain of the officers took advantage of the delay
to land on the nearest point of the island of ombay where the coast
had a very inviting appearance they went on shore near a village
called bitouka and advanced to meet a body of the natives armed with
shields and cuirasses made of buffalo-skin and carrying bows arrows
and daggers savages though they were they had quite the air of
warriors and were not at all afraid of fire-arms on the contrary
they argued that the loading of the gun caused loss of time for while
that operation was going on they could fire off a great number of
arrows

gaimard writes "the points of the arrows were of hard wood or of
bone and some of iron the arrows themselves displayed fan-wise were
fastened on the left side of the warrior to the belt of his sword or
dagger most of these people wore bundles of palm-leaves slit so as to
allow red or black coloured strips of the same to be passed through to
hold them together which were attached to the belt or the right thigh
the rustling sound produced with every movement of the wearers of this
singular ornament increased by knocking against the cuirass or the
buckler with the addition of the tinkling of little bells which also
formed part of the warrior's equipment altogether made such a jumble
of discordant sounds that we could not refrain from laughing far from
taking offence our ombayan friends joined heartily in our merriment
m arago[1] greatly excited their astonishment by performing some
sleight-of-hand tricks we then took our way straight to the village of
bitouka which was situated on a rising ground in passing one of their
cottages we happened to see about a score of human jawbones suspended
from the roof and anxious to get possession of one or two i offered
the most valuable articles i had about me in exchange the answer was
'palami' they are sacred we ascertained afterwards that these were
the jawbones of their enemies preserved as trophies of victory"

this excursion derived greater interest from the circumstance of the
island of ombay having been up to that time rarely visited by
europeans and the few vessels that had effected any landing brought
mournful accounts of the warlike and ferocious temper of the natives
and even in some instances of their cannibal propensities thus in 1802
the merchant-ship rose had her small boat carried off and the crew
were detained as prisoners by the savages ten years later the captain
of the ship inacho who landed by himself received several arrow
wounds again in 1817 an english frigate sent the cutter ashore for
the purpose of getting wood when a scrimmage took place between the
crew and the natives which ended in the former being killed and eaten
the day after an armed sloop was despatched in quest of the missing
crew but nothing was found save some fragments of the cutter and the
bloody remains of the unfortunate men

in view of these facts the french travellers must be congratulated on
having escaped being entrapped by the savage cannibals which would
undoubtedly have been attempted had the uranie stayed long enough at
ombay

on the 17th of november the anchor was let go at dili

after the customary interchange of compliments with the portuguese
governor freycinet made known the requirements of the expedition and
received a friendly assurance that the necessary provisions should be
instantly forthcoming the reception given to all the members of the
expedition was both hearty and liberal and when freycinet took his
leave the governor wishing that he should carry away some souvenir of
his visit presented him with two boys and two girls of the ages of
six and seven natives of failacor a kingdom in the interior of timor
to insure the acceptance of this present the governor d josé pinto
alcofarado d'azevado e souza stated that the race to which the
children belonged was quite unknown in europe in spite of all the
strong and conclusive reasons that freycinet gave to explain why he
felt compelled to decline the present he was obliged to take charge of
one of the little boys who subsequently received the name of joseph
antonio in baptism but when sixteen years old died of some scrofulous
disease at paris

on a first examination it would appear that the population of timor
belonged altogether to the asiatic race but so far as any reliance can
be placed upon somewhat extended researches there is reason to think
that in the unfrequented mountains in the centre of the island there
exists a race of negroes with woolly hair and savage manners of the
type of the indigenous races of new guinea and new ireland whom one is
led to consider the primitive population this line of research
commenced at the close of the eighteenth century by an englishman of
the name of crawford has been in our time carried forward with
striking results by the labours of the learned doctors broca and e
hamy to the latter of whom the reading public are indebted for the
pleasing and instructive papers on primitive populations which have
appeared in nature and in the journals of the royal geographical
society

after leaving timor the uranie proceeded towards the strait of
bourou and in passing between the islands of wetter and roma got sight
of the picturesque island of gasses clothed in the brightest and
thickest verdure imaginable the corvette was then drifted by currents
almost as far as the island of pisang near which she fell in with
three dhows manned by natives of the island of gueby these people
have an olive complexion broad flat noses and thick lips some are
strong looking robust and athletic others are slender and weakly in
appearance and others again thickset and repulsive-looking the only
clothing worn by the majority at this time was a pair of drawers
fastened with a handkerchief round the waist

a landing was effected on the little island of pisang it was found to
be of volcanic origin and the soil formed from the decomposition of
trachytic lava was evidently very fertile from pisang the corvette
made her way among islands till then scarcely known to rawak where
she cast anchor at noon on the 16th of december this island though
small is inhabited but though our navigators were often visited by
the natives of waigiou opportunities for studying this species of the
human family have been rare moreover it ought to be mentioned that
through ignorance of the language of the indigenous tribes and the
difficulty of making them understand through the medium of malayan of
which they know only a few words even those few opportunities have not
been turned to much account as soon as a suitable position was found
the instruments were set up and the usual physical and astronomical
observations were made in conjunction with geographical researches

[illustration rawak hut on piles (fac-simile of early engraving)]

the islands which freycinet calls the islands of the papuans are rawak
boni waigiou and manouran which are situated almost immediately
below the equator the largest of these waigiou is not less than
seventy-two miles from one side to the other the low shorage consists
mainly of swamp and morass while the banks which run up steeply are
surrounded by coral reefs and are full of small caves hollowed out by
the waves all the islets are clothed with vegetation of surprising
beauty they abound with magnificent trees amongst which the
"barringtonia" may be recognized with its voluminous trunk always
leaning towards the sea allowing the tips of the branches to touch the
water the "scoevola lobelia" fig-trees mangroves the casuarinæ
with their straight and slender stems shooting up to the height of
forty feet the rima the takanahaka with its trunk more than twenty
feet in circumference the cynometer belonging to the family of
leguminous plants bright from its topmost to its lowest branches with
pale red flowers and golden fruits and besides these rarer trees
palms nutmeg-trees roseapple-trees banana-trees flourish in the low
and moist ground

[illustration the luxuriant vegetation of the papuan islands]

the fauna however has not attained to the same exceptionally fine
development as the flora at rawak the phalanger and the sheepdog in a
wild state were the only quadrupeds met with in waigiou the boar
called barberossa and a diminutive of the same race were found but as
to the feathered tribe they were not so numerous as one might have
supposed the plants yielding grain necessary for the sustenance of
birds not being able to thrive in the dense shade of the forests
hornbills are here met with whose wings furnished with long feathers
separated at the tips make a very loud noise when they fly great
quantities of parrots kingfishers turtle-doves piping-crows brown
hawks crested pigeons and possibly also birds of paradise though the
travellers did not see any specimens

the papuans themselves are positively repulsively ugly to quote the
words of odet-pellion "a flat skull a facial angle of 75 degrees a
large mouth eyes small and sunken a thick nose flat at the end and
pressed down on the upper lip a scanty beard a peculiarity of the
people of those regions already noticed shoulders of a moderate size
a prominent belly and slight lower limbs these are the chief
characteristics of the papuans their hair both in its nature and mode
of arrangement varies a good deal most commonly it is dressed with
great pains into a matted structure not less than eight inches in
height composed of a mass of soft downy hair curling naturally or it
is frizzed up till it positively bristles and with the assistance of
a coating of grease is plastered round the skull in the shape of a
globe a long wooden comb of six or seven teeth is also often stuck in
not so much to aid in keeping the mass together as to give a finishing
touch of ornament"

these unfortunate people are afflicted with the terrible scourge of
leprosy which is so prevalent that at least a tenth part of the
population are infested with the disease the cause of this dreadful
malady must be sought in the insalubrity of the climate the miasma
from the marshes which are overflowed with sea-water every flood tide
the neighbourhood of the burial-places which are badly kept and
perhaps also to the consumption of shell-fish which these natives
devour greedily

all the houses whether inland or on the coast are built on piles
many of these dwellings are erected in places extremely difficult of
access they are made by thrusting stakes into the earth to which
transverse beams are fastened with ropes made of fibre and on these a
flooring is laid of palm-leaves trimmed and strongly intertwined one
with another these leaves made to lap over in an artistic fashion
are also used for the roof of the house which has only one door
should the dwellings be built over the water communication is carried
on between them and the shore by means of a kind of bridge resting upon
trestles the movable flooring of which can be quickly taken up every
house is also surrounded by a kind of balcony furnished with a
balustrade

the travellers could not obtain any information as to the friendly
disposition of these natives whether the whole tribe consists of large
communities united under one chief or several whether each community
obeys only its own proper head whether the population is numerous or
not are all points which could not be ascertained the name by which
they call themselves is alfourous they appeared to talk in several
distinct dialects which differ remarkably from papuan or malay

the inhabitants of this group seem to be a very industrious race they
manufacture all sorts of fishing apparatus very cleverly they are
expert in finding their way through the forests they know how to
prepare the pith of the sago-plant and to make ovens for the cooking
of the sago they can turn pottery ware weave mats carpets baskets
and can also carve idols and figures in the harbour of boni on the
coast of waigiou mm quoy and gaimard noticed a statue moulded in
white clay under a sort of canopy close to a tomb it represented a
man standing upright of the natural height with his hands raised
towards heaven the head was of wood with the cheeks and eyes inlaid
with small pieces of white shell

on the 6th of january 1819 having taken in supplies at rawak the
uranie proceeded on her voyage and soon came in sight of the ayou
islands mere sand-banks surrounded by breakers of which few
geographical details had been known up to that time there was much to
be done in the way of accurate survey but unfortunately the
hydrographers were sorely hindered in their work by the fever which
they and some forty of the crew had contracted at rawak sailing on
the anchoret islands came in sight on the 12th of february and on the
day following the amirantes but the uranie did not attempt to make
for the land shortly after passing the amirantes the corvette sighted
st bartholomew which the inhabitants call poulousouk it belongs to
the caroline archipelago a busy trade always attended with much
uproar was soon set on foot with the indigenous people who resisted
all persuasion to come on board conducting all their transactions
nevertheless with admirable good faith in no instance showing any
dishonest tendencies one after another poulouhat alet tamatam
allap tanadik all islands belonging to this archipelago passed
before the admiring gaze of the french navigators at length on the
17th of march 1819 just eighteen months from the time of quitting
france freycinet got sight of the marianne islands and cast anchor in
the roads of umata on the coast of guam just as the officers of the
expedition were ready to go on shore the governor of the island d
medinilla y pineda accompanied by his lieutenant major d luis de
torrès came on board to bid them welcome these gentlemen showed a
polite anxiety to learn what the explorers stood in need of and
engaged that all their wants should be supplied with the least possible
delay

no time was lost in looking for a place suited for conversion into a
temporary hospital and one being found the sick on board to the
number of twenty were removed to it for treatment the very next day

a dinner to the staff of the expedition was given by the governor and
all the officers assembled in his house at the appointed hour they
found a table covered with light cakes and fruits in the midst of
which were two bowls of hot punch some surprise escaped the guests in
private remarks to one another at this singular kind of banquet could
it be a fast-day? why did no one sit down? but as there was no
interpreter to clear up these points and as it would have been
unbecoming to ask for an explanation they kept their difficulties for
solution among themselves and paid attention to the good things before
them soon a fresh surprise came the table was cleared and covered
with various sorts of prepared dishes in short a substantial and
sumptuous dinner was served the collation which had been taken at the
commencement called in the language of the country "refresco" had
been intended only to whet the appetites of the guests for what was to
follow

after this luxurious dinners became quite the rage at guam two days
subsequent to the governor's banquet the officers found themselves at
a dinner-party of fifty guests where no less than forty-four separate
dishes were served at each of the three courses of which the dinner
consisted freycinet from information he had received relates that
"this dinner cost the lives of two oxen and three fat pigs to say
nothing of poultry game and fish such a slaughter i should think
has not been known since the marriage-feast of gamache no doubt our
host considered that persons who had undergone so many privations
during a protracted voyage ought to be compensated with an unusually
profuse entertainment the dessert showed no falling off either in
abundance or in variety it was succeeded by tea coffee creams
liqueurs of every description and as the 'refresco' had been served as
usual an hour previous to dinner it will be admitted without question
that at guam the most intrepid gourmand could find no other cause for
disappointment but the limited capacity of the human stomach"

however the objects of the mission were not interfered with by all
this dining and festivity natural history excursions magnetical
observations the geographical survey of the island of guam entrusted
to duperrey were all being pushed forward simultaneously but in the
meantime the corvette had got to moorings in the deep water off the
port of st louis while the chief of the staff as well as the sick
were housed at agagna the capital of the island and the seat of
government at that place in honour of the french visitors
cock-fights took place a kind of sport very popular in all the spanish
possessions in oceania dances also were given the figures in which
it was said contained allusions to events in the history of mexico
the dancers students of the agagna college were dressed in rich
silks imported a long time previously by the jesuits from new spain
then came combats with sticks in which the carolins took part which
again were succeeded almost uninterruptedly by other amusements but
what freycinet considered of most value was the mass of information
concerning the customs and manners of the former inhabitants of the
islands which he obtained through major d luis torrès who himself
born in the country had made a constant study of this subject of this
interesting information use will be made when the subject is presently
resumed but first some notice must be taken of an excursion to the
islands rota and tinian the latter of which had already become known
to us through the narratives of former travellers

[illustration a performer of the dances of montezuma (fac-simile of
early engraving)]

on the 22nd april a small fleet of eight proas conveyed mm berard
gaudichaud and jacques arago to rota where their arrival occasioned
great surprise and alarm explained by the fact that a report had
gained currency in the island that the corvette was manned with rebels
from america

beyond rota the proas reached tinian where the arid plains recalled to
the travellers the desolate coasts of the land of endracht testifying
to the considerable changes that must have taken place there since the
time when lord anson described the place as a terrestrial paradise

the marianne archipelago was discovered by magellan on the 6th march
1521 and at first received the name of islas de las velas latinas
the isles of the lateen sails but subsequently that of the ladrones
or the robbers if one may trust pigafetta the illustrious admiral saw
no islands but tinian saypan and agoignan five years later they were
visited by the spaniard loyasa whose cordial reception was quite a
contrast to that of magellan and in 1565 the islands were declared to
be spanish territory by miguel lopez de legaspi it was not however
until 1669 that they were colonized and evangelized by father
sanvitores it will be understood that we should not follow freycinet's
narrative of past events in the history of this archipelago were it
not that the manuscripts and works of every kind which he was permitted
to consult enabled him to treat the subject de novo and throw upon
it the light of real knowledge

the admiration still lingering in the minds of the travellers which
had been aroused by the incredible fertility of the papuan islands and
the moluccas was no doubt calculated to weaken the impression produced
by any of the marianne islands the forests of guam though well
stocked did not present the gigantic appearance common to forest
scenery in the tropics they extended over a large part of the island
yet there were also immense spaces devoted to pasturage where not a
breadfruit-tree nor a cocoa-nut palm was to be seen in the depths of
the forests moreover the conquerors of the islands had created
artificial glades in order that the herds of horned cattle which they
had introduced might find food and also enjoy shelter from the sun

agoignan an island with a very rocky coast presented from a distance
an arid and barren appearance but is in reality thickly clothed with
trees even to the summit of its highest mountains

rota is a regular jungle an almost impenetrable mass of brushwood
above which rise thickets of rimas tamarind fig and palm trees
tinian too presents anything but an agreeable appearance the french
explorers altogether missed the charming scenes described in such
glowing colours by their predecessors but the appearance of the soil
and the immense number of dead trees led them to the conclusion that
old accounts were not altogether exaggerated especially as the
southern portion of the island is now rendered quite inaccessible by
its dense forests

at the time of freycinet's visit the population of these islands was of
a very mixed character the aborigines being quite in the minority the
more highly born of the natives were formerly bigger stronger and
better made than europeans but the race is degenerating and the
primitive type in its purity is now only to be met with in rota

capital swimmers and divers able to walk immense distances without
fatigue every man of them had to prove his proficiency in these
exercises on his marriage but although this proficiency has been in
some measure kept up the leading characteristic of the people of the
marianne group is idleness or perhaps to be more strictly accurate
indifference

marriages are contracted at a very early age the bridegroom being
generally between fifteen and eighteen the bride between twelve and
fifteen a numerous progeny is the result of these unions instances
being on record of twenty-two children born of one mother

not only do the people of guam suffer from many diseases such as lung
complaints smallpox &c introduced by europeans but also from some
which seem to be endemic or in any case to have assumed a type
peculiar to the place and altogether abnormal such are elephantiasis
and leprosy three varieties of which are met with at guam differing
from each other alike in their symptoms and their effects

before the conquest the people of the mariannes lived on the fruit of
the rima or bread-tree rice sago and other farinaceous plants their
mode of cooking these articles was extremely simple though not so much
so as their style of dress for they went about in a state of nature
unrelieved even by the traditional fig-leaf

at the present time children still wear no clothing till they are about
ten years old alluding to this peculiar custom captain pages writing
at the close of last century says "i found myself near a house in
front of which an indian girl about eleven years old was squatted on
her heels in the full blaze of the sun without a vestige of clothing
on her chemise lay folded on the ground in front of her when she saw
me approaching she got up quickly and put it on again although still
far from decently clothed for only her shoulders were covered by it
she now considered herself properly dressed and stood before me quite
unembarrassed"

judging from the remains nearly everywhere to be met with such as the
ruins of dwellings originally supported by masonry pillars it is plain
that the population was formerly considerable the earliest traveller
who has made any reference to this subject is lord anson he has given
a somewhat fanciful description which however the explorers in the
uranie were able to corroborate as will be seen from the following
extract

"the description found in the narrative of lord anson's voyage is
correct but the ruins and the branches of the trees that have in some
way twined themselves about the masonry pillars wear now a very
different aspect from what they did in his time the sharp edges of the
pillars have got rubbed away and the half-globes that surmounted them
have no longer their former roundness"

[illustration ruins of ancient pillars at tinian (fac-simile of early
engraving)]

of the structures of more recent date only a sixth part are of stone
at agagna may be counted several buildings possessing some interest on
account of their size if not on that of their elegance grandeur or
the fineness of their proportions these are the college of st john
lateran the church the clergy-house the governor's palace and the
taverns

before the spaniards established their sway in these islands the
natives were divided into three classes the nobility the inferior
nobility and the commonalty these last the pariahs of the country
freycinet remarks though without citing his authority were of a more
diminutive stature than the other inhabitants this difference of
height is however scarcely a sufficient reason for pronouncing them
to be of a different race from the other two classes is it not more
reasonable to conclude it to be the result of the degrading servitude
to which they have been subjected? these plebeians could under no
circumstances raise themselves to a higher class and a seafaring life
was forbidden to them each of the three castes had its own sorceresses
and priestesses or medicine-women who each devoted her attention to
the treatment of some one disorder only no reason however for
crediting them with any special skill in its cure

the business of canoe-building was monopolized by the nobles who
however allowed the inferior nobles to assist in their construction
the making of canoes was to them a work of the utmost importance and
the nobles maintained it as one of their most valuable privileges the
language spoken in the philippine group though it has some affinity
with the malay and tagala dialects has all the same a distinctive
character of its own freycinet's narrative also contains much
information on the extremely singular customs of the former population
of the mariannes which are beyond our province though well worthy of
the attention of the philosopher and historian

the uranie had been now more than two months at anchor it was full
time to resume the work of exploration freycinet and his staff
therefore devoted the few remaining days of their stay to the task of
paying farewell visits and expressing their gratitude for the hearty
kindness which had been so profusely shown to them the governor
however not only declined to admit his claim to thanks from the french
travellers for the hospitable attentions heaped upon them for upwards
of two months but also refused to accept any payment for the supplies
which had been furnished for the refitting of the corvette he even
went so far as to write a letter of apology for the scantiness of the
provisions the result of the drought which had desolated guam for the
previous six months and which had prevented him from doing things as
he could have wished the final farewell took place off agagna "it was
impossible" says freycinet "to take leave of the amiable man who had
loaded us with so many proofs of his friendly disposition without
being deeply affected i was too much moved to be able to find
expression for the feelings with which my heart was filled but the
tears which filled my eyes must have been to him a surer evidence than
any words could have been of my gratitude and my regret"

from the 5th to the 16th june the uranie occupied in an exploring
cruise round the north of the marianne islands in the course of which
were made the observations of which the substance has been given above
the commander wishing to make a quick passage to the sandwich islands
then took advantage of a breeze to gain a higher latitude where he
hoped to meet with favourable winds but as the explorers penetrated
further and further into this part of the pacific ocean cold and dense
fogs wrapped them round permeating the whole vessel with damp equally
unpleasant and injurious to health however the crew suffered no worse
inconvenience than slight colds in fact the change had rather a
bracing effect than otherwise on men now for some time accustomed to
the enervating heat of the tropics

on the 6th august the south point of hawaï was doubled and freycinet
made for the western side of the island where he hoped to find a safe
and convenient anchorage a dead calm prevailing the first and second
days were spent in opening relations with the natives the women came
off in crowds immediately on the arrival of the ship with the view of
carrying on their usual trade but the commander laid an interdict on
their coming on board

the first piece of news given to the captain by one of the areois[2]
was that king kamahamaha was dead and that his young son rio rio had
succeeded him taking advantage of a change of wind the uranie sailed
on to the bay of karakakoa and freycinet was about to send an officer
in advance to take soundings when a canoe put off from the shore
having on board the governor of the island prince kouakini otherwise
john adams[3] who promised the captain that he would find boats
suitable for the taking of the necessary supplies to the corvette this
young man about nine and twenty years of age almost a giant in
stature but well proportioned surprised freycinet by the extent of
his information on being informed that the corvette was on a voyage of
discovery he inquired "have you doubled cape horn or did you come
round the cape of good hope?" he then asked for the latest information
about napoleon and wished to know whether it was true that the island
of st helena had been swallowed up with all its inhabitants a story
he had evidently heard from some facetious whalemen but had not
entirely believed

[footnote 2 see part ii chapter 1 footnote 3 on the areois]

[footnote 3 it was the custom for the chiefs in these parts to assume
new names often for the most trifling reasons trans]

kouakini next apprised freycinet that though actual disturbances had
not broken out on the death of kamahamaha yet that some of the chiefs
having asserted claims to independence the stability of the monarchy
was in some danger as a result the political situation was strained
and the government was in some perplexity a state of things which
probably would soon terminate especially if the commandant would
consent to make some declaration in favour of the youthful sovereign
freycinet landed with the prince to pay him a return visit and on
entering his house was introduced to his wife a very corpulent woman
who was lying on a european bedstead covered with matting after this
visit the captain and his host went to visit the widows of kamahamaha
the prince's sisters but not being able to see them they proceeded to
the yards and workshops of the deceased king here were four sheds
sacred to the building of large war-canoes and others containing
european boats farther on were seen wood for building purposes bars
of copper quantities of fishing-nets a forge a cooper's workshop
and lastly some cases belonging to the prime minister kraimokou
filled with all necessary appliances for navigation such as compasses
sextants thermometers watches and even a chronometer strangers were
not allowed to inspect two other magazines in which were stored powder
and other war-materials strong liquors iron &c all these places
were for the present abandoned by the new sovereign who held his court
at koaihai bay

freycinet on receiving an invitation from the king made ready to
visit him there under the guidance of a native pilot who showed
himself most attentive and was very skilful in forecasting the
weather "the monarch" writes freycinet "was waiting for me on the
beach dressed in the full uniform of an english captain and
surrounded by the whole of his suite in spite of the terrible
barrenness of this side of the island the spectacle of the grotesque
assemblage of men and women was not without grandeur and beauty the
king himself stood in front with his principal officers a little
distance behind him some wearing splendid mantles made of red or
yellow feathers or of scarlet cloth others in short tippets of the
same kind but in which the two glaring colours were relieved with
black a few had helmets on their heads this striking picture was
further diversified by a number of soldiers grouped here and there and
clad in various and strange costumes"

the sovereign now under notice was the same who with his young and
charming wife undertook at a later period a voyage to england where
they both died their remains were brought back to hawaï by captain
byron in the frigate la blonde

freycinet seized this opportunity to repeat his request for supplies of
fresh provisions and the king promised that two days should not pass
before his wishes should be fully complied with however although the
good faith of the young monarch was above suspicion the commander soon
discovered that most of the chiefs had no intention of obeying their
sovereign's orders

some little time after this the principal officers of the staff went
to pay a visit to the widows of kamahamaha the following amusing
description of their lively reception is given by m quoy "a strange
spectacle" he says "met our view on our entrance into an apartment of
narrow dimensions where eight lumps of half naked humanity lay on the
ground with their faces downwards it was not an easy task to find
space to lay ourselves down according to custom in the same manner the
attendants were constantly on the move some carrying fans made of
feathers to whisk away the flies another a lighted pipe which was
passed from one prostrate figure to another each taking a whiff or
two while the rest were engaged in shampooing the royal personages
conversation it may readily be imagined was not well maintained under
these trying circumstances and had it not been for some excellent
watermelons which were handed to us the tedium of the interview would
have been insupportable"

freycinet next went to pay a visit to the famous john young who had
been for so long a time the faithful friend and sagacious adviser of
king kamahamaha although he was then old and in bad health he was not
the less able to supply freycinet with some valuable information about
the sandwich islands where he had lived for thirty years and in the
history of which he had played a prominent part

kraimokou the minister during a visit which he was paying on board
the uranie had caught sight of the abbé de quelen the chaplain
whose costume puzzled him a good deal as soon as he had learned that
the strangely dressed person was a priest he expressed to the
commandant a desire to receive baptism his mother he said had been
admitted to that sacrament upon her deathbed and she had obtained from
him a promise to submit himself to the same ceremony as soon as he met
with a convenient opportunity freycinet gave his consent and
endeavoured to make the proceeding as solemn as possible all the more
because rio rio requested permission to be present at it with all his
suite every one behaved with the utmost decorum and reverence while
the ceremony was taking place but immediately on its close there was a
general rush to the collation which the commandant had ordered to be
prepared it was wonderful to see how rapidly the bottles of wine and
the flasks of rum and of brandy were emptied and to witness the speedy
disappearance of the viands with which the table had been covered
fortunately the day was coming to a close or rio rio and the majority
of his officers and courtiers would not have been in a condition to
reach the shore in spite of this however it was necessary to comply
with his request for two additional bottles of brandy that he might
as he said drink the health of the commander and success to his
voyage a request which all his attendants felt bound in politeness to
make likewise

"it is not an over-statement" observes freycinet "to say that in the
short space of two hours our distinguished guests drank and carried
away what would have been sufficient to supply the wants of ten
ordinary persons for three months" several presents had been exchanged
between the royal pair and the commander among those made by the young
queen was a cloak of feathers a kind of garment which had become
exceedingly scarce in the sandwich islands

freycinet was about to set sail again when he learnt from an american
captain that a merchant-vessel was lying off the island of miow having
a large quantity of biscuit and rice on board which there was no doubt
might be purchased this information determined freycinet to anchor
first off raheina among other reasons because it was there that
kraimokou had undertaken to deliver a number of pigs which were
required for the use of the crew but the minister displayed signal bad
faith in the transaction he tendered miserably poor pigs and demanded
an extravagantly high price so that it was necessary to have recourse
to threats before the business could be satisfactorily arranged in
this matter kraimokou was under the misguidance of an english runaway
convict from port jackson and most probably had the native been left
to obey the promptings of his own nature he would have acted on this
occasion with the good faith and the sense of honour which were his
usual characteristics

on reaching the island of waihou freycinet dropped anchor off
honolulu the hearty welcome he received from the european residents
made him regret that he had not come here direct to begin with for he
was able without any delay to procure all the supplies which he had
found so much difficulty in getting together at the two other islands
boki the governor of waihou received baptism from the chaplain of the
uranie he was prompted apparently by no other motive than a wish to
do as his brother had done who had previously received this sacrament
he was far from having the air of intelligence common to the other
natives of the various islands of the sandwich group hitherto visited

many observations on these natives are made in the narrative of the
expedition which are too interesting to be passed over without a brief
summary here all navigators are agreed in considering that the class
of chiefs belong to a race excelling the other inhabitants both in
intelligence and in stature it is very unusual to find one who is less
than six feet in height obesity is very common but chiefly among the
women who while still quite young often become enormously corpulent
the sandwich type is strongly marked and distinct pretty women are
numerous but the blessing of length of days is seldom enjoyed an old
man of seventy is a rare phenomenon this early decline and premature
death must be ascribed to the persistent dissipation in which the
people pass their lives

on leaving the sandwich islands freycinet found it necessary to notice
carefully the curves of the magnetic equator in low latitudes[4]
accordingly he crowded all sail in an easterly direction on the 7th
october the uranie entered the southern hemisphere and on the 19th
of the same month the dangerous islands came in sight to the eastward
of the navigators' archipelago an island was discovered not marked on
the charts which was named "rose" after madame freycinet this was
the only actual discovery of the voyage

[footnote 4 this refers to the line made up of the succession of
points at which the magnetic needle ceases to indicate trans]

the position of the islands of pylstaart and howe was next rectified
and on the 13th november the lights of port jackson or sydney were at
last sighted

freycinet had fully expected to find the town enlarged during the
sixteen years that had passed since his last visit but his
astonishment was great indeed at the sight of a large and prosperous
european city set down in the midst of scenery which might almost be
called wild but as the travellers made excursions in various
directions fresh signs of the progress which the colony had made were
forced on their attention fine roads carefully kept bordered with the
eucalyptus styled by pérou "the giant of the australian forests" well
constructed bridges distances marked by milestones proved the
existence of a well organized local administration whilst the charming
cottages the numerous herds of cattle and the carefully cultivated
fields bore testimony to the industry and perseverance of the new
colonists

governor macquarie and the principal authorities of the province vied
with each other in showing attention to the french travellers who
however persisted in declining all but a single invitation lest the
work of the mission should not receive its fair share of attention the
entertainment given by the governor took place at his country house at
paramatta whither the officers of the expedition proceeded by water
accompanied by a military band several of them also visited the little
town of liverpool built in a pleasant situation on the banks of the
river george excursions too were made to the little villages of
richmond and windsor which were growing up near hawkesbury river at
the same time a party of the staff joined in a kangaroo hunt and
crossing the blue mountains penetrated the bathurst settlement

through the friendly relations which freycinet had established with the
residents during his two visits he was able to collect numerous
interesting details respecting the australian colony therefore the
chapter that he devotes to new south wales recording the marvellous
and rapid advance of this effort at colonization excited a lively
interest in france where the development and growing prosperity of
australia were very imperfectly known freycinet's narrative was there
quite a new revelation well calculated to excite inquiry and which
had moreover the advantage of showing the exact condition of the
colony so late as the year 1825

the chain of mountains at some distance from the coast known by the
name of the australian alps separates new south wales from the
interior of the australian continent for twenty-five years this chain
formed a barrier against all communication with the country beyond but
now thanks to the energy of governor macquarie the barrier has been
removed a zigzag road has been cut in the rock thus opening the way
to the colonization of wide spreading plains watered by important
rivers the loftiest summits of this chain nearly 10000 feet in
height are covered with snow even in the middle of summer whilst the
elevation of the principal peaks mount exmouth mount cunningham and
others was being taken it was discovered that so far from australia
possessing only one large watercourse the swan river it had several
the chief being hawkesbury river formed by the confluence of the
nepean the grose and the brisbane the river murray not being yet
known at the period under notice a commencement had been made in the
working of coal-mines slate quarries layers of solid carbonate of
iron sandstone chalk porphyry and jasper but the presence of gold
the metal that was to effect so rapid a development of the young
colony had not as yet been established

the nature of the soil varies on the sea-coast it is barren able only
to support the growth of a few stunted trees but inland the traveller
meets with fields clothed with a rich vegetation vast pasturages in
which here and there rise a few tall shrubs and forests where giant
trees entwined with an inextricable growth of underwood defy all
attempts to penetrate to their recesses

[illustration an australian farm near the blue mountains (fac-simile
of early engraving)]

one circumstance which much surprised travellers was the apparent
homogeneity of race throughout the whole of this immense continent
take the aborigines at the bay of sharks or in the land of endracht
or by the swan river or at port jackson and the same complexion and
the same kind of hair the same features the same physique all prove
indisputably that they have sprung from one common origin those
dwelling by the rivers or on the sea coast subsist chiefly on shell or
other fish but those living in the interior trust to hunting for their
food and will eat indiscriminately the flesh of the opossum or the
kangaroo not rejecting even lizards snakes worms or ants the last
named of which they manufacture into a sort of paste with the addition
of their eggs and the roots of ferns all over the continent the
practice of the aborigines is to go completely naked though they have
no objection to put on any articles of european clothing that they can
get possession of it is said that in 1820 at port jackson there was a
laughable caricature of the european style of dress to be seen in the
person of an ancient negress who went about clothed in some pieces of
an old woollen blanket wearing on her head a bonnet of green silk a
few of the aborigines however make themselves cloaks of opossum or
kangaroo skin stitching the pieces together with the nerve-fibres of
the cassowary but this kind of garment is of rare occurrence

though their hair is smooth they plaster it with grease and arrange it
in curls then inserting in the middle a tuft of grass they raise a
strange and comical superstructure surmounted by a few cockatoo
feathers or failing these they fasten on with the aid of a resinous
gum a few human teeth or some bits of bone a dog's tail or one or
two fish bones although the practice of tattooing is not much in
favour among the natives of new holland some are occasionally to be
seen who have succeeded by means of sharp shells in cutting symmetrical
figures upon their skins a more general custom is that of painting on
their bodies monstrous designs in red and white colours which on their
dark skins give them an almost diabolical aspect

these savages formerly believed that after death they would take the
form of children and be transported to the clouds or to the summits of
lofty trees where in a sort of aërial paradise they would be regaled
with plentiful repasts but since the arrival of the europeans their
faith on this point has undergone some change their present belief
being that metamorphosed into whites they will go to inhabit some
far-off land it is also an article of their creed that the whites
themselves are no other than their own ancestors who having been
killed in battle have assumed the form of europeans

the census of 1819 one of the strictest hitherto instituted gives the
number of the colonists at 25425 this return it must be understood
does not take in the soldiers the women being very much in the
minority the mother-country had made efforts to remedy the
inconvenience resulting from this great disparity of the sexes by
promoting the immigration of young women who soon married and founded
families of a higher tone of morality than that of the convicts

freycinet devotes a very long chapter in his narrative to all matters
connected with political economy the various soils and the crops
suited to them industrial pursuits the breeding of cattle farming
economy manufactures foreign trade means of communication
government all these subjects are treated comprehensively on the
authority of documents then newly compiled and with an ability that
could scarcely have been expected from a man who had not given special
attention to questions of this nature he has moreover added a close
inquiry into the regimen which the convicts were subjected to from the
time of their arrival in the colony the punishments they had to
undergo as also the encouragements and rewards which were readily
granted to them when earned by good behaviour the chapter concludes
with reflections full of learning and sound judgment on the probable
development and future prosperity of the australian colony

after this long and fruitful stay in new holland the uranie put to
sea on the 25th december 1819 and steered so as to pass to the south
of new zealand and campbell island with the view of doubling cape
horn a few days afterwards ten fugitive convicts were discovered on
board but the corvette had left the shores of australia too far behind
to allow of their restoration the coast of tierra del fuego was
reached without anything worthy of special notice having occurred
during a very prosperous voyage with a prevailing west wind on the
5th february cape desolation was sighted having doubled cape horn
without any difficulty the uranie let go her anchor in the bay of
good success where the shores lined with grand forest-trees and
echoing to the sound of waterfalls presented a scene totally different
from the sterile desolation generally characterizing this quarter of
the globe no long stay was however made there the corvette resuming
her voyage lost no time in entering the strait of le maire
notwithstanding a dense haze here she met with a heavy swell a strong
gale and a mist so thick that land sea and sky were confounded in
one general obscurity the rain and the heavy spray raised by the
storm and the coming on of night made it necessary to put the
uranie under a close-reefed topsail and jib under which pressure of
sail she behaved splendidly the only available course was to run
before the wind and the travellers had just begun to feel thankful for
their good fortune in being driven by the storm far away from the land
when the cry was heard "land close ahead"

all hearts sunk with despair shipwreck and death seemed inevitable
freycinet alone after a brief instant of hesitation recovered his
self-command it was impossible that land could be ahead he
therefore kept on his northerly course bearing a little east and the
correctness of his calculations was soon verified on the next day but
one the weather grew calmer observations were taken and as they
proved the vessel to have run a great distance from the bay of good
success the commander had to choose between a detention off the coast
of south america or off the falkland islands the island of conti the
bay of marville and cape duras were successively observed through the
haze whilst a favourable breeze speeded the corvette on her course to
berkeley sound fixed on as the best place for the next halt

mutual congratulations were already being exchanged on the happy
termination of the dangerous struggle and on the fortunate escape from
any serious accident during so hazardous a trip the sailors all
rejoiced to use the words of byron that 

  "the worst was over and the rest seemed sure"

but a severe trial was still in store for them

on entering berkeley sound every man was at his post ready to let go
the anchor the look-outs were on the watch men were stationed in the
main-shrouds to heave the lead then first at twenty after at eighteen
fathoms the presence of rocks was reported the ship was now about
half a league off shore and freycinet thought it prudent to put her
off about two points this precaution proved fatal for the corvette
suddenly struck violently on a hidden rock as she struck the
soundings gave fifteen fathoms to starboard and twelve to larboard
the reef against which the corvette had run was therefore not so
wide as the vessel itself in fact it was but the pointed summit of a
rock

the immediate rising of pieces of wood to the surface of the water at
once gave reason for fears that the injury was serious there was a
rush to the pumps water was pouring into the hold freycinet had sent
for a sail and had it passed under the vessel in such a manner that
the pressure of the water forcing it into the leak in a measure stopped
it up but it was of no avail although the whole ship's company
officers and sailors alike worked at the pumps no more could be done
than just keep the water from gaining on the vessel there was nothing
for it but to run her ashore this decision painful as it was had to
be carried out and it was indeed no easy task on every side the land
was girded with rocks and only at the very bottom of the bay was there
a strip of sandy beach favourable for running the ship aground
meanwhile the wind had become contrary night was approaching the
vessel was already half full of water the distress of the commander
can be imagined but there was no alternative so the vessel was
stranded on penguin island

"this effected" to quote freycinet "the men were so exhausted that it
was necessary to cease further work of every kind and to allow the
crew an interval of rest all the more indispensable on account of the
hardships and dangers which our present disastrous situation must
entail upon all as for myself repose was out of the question
tormented by a thousand harassing reflections i could scarcely credit
my own existence the sudden transition from a position where all
things seemed to smile on me to that in which i found myself at that
moment weighed on my spirits like a horrible nightmare it was
difficult to regain the composure necessary to face fairly the painful
trial all my companions had done their duty in the frightful accident
which had all but lost us our lives and i am glad to be able to do
justice to their admirable conduct

"as soon as daylight revealed the nature of the country a mournful
gloomy look settled upon every countenance not a tree not so much as
a blade of grass was to be seen not a sound was to be heard and the
silent desolation around reminded us of the bay of sharks"

[illustration berkeley sound in the falkland islands]

but there was no time to be lost in vain lamentations was the sea to
be allowed to swallow up the journals and observations the precious
results of so much labour and so many hardships?

all the papers were saved the same good fortune did not
unfortunately attend the collections several cases of specimens which
were at the bottom of the hold were entirely lost others were damaged
by the sea water the collections that sustained the chief injury were
those of natural history and the herbarium that had been put together
with infinite trouble by gaudichaud the merino sheep generously
presented to the expedition by mr macarthur of sydney which it was
hoped could be acclimatized in france were brought on shore as also
were all the animals still alive

a few tents were pitched first for the sick happily not very
numerous and then for the officers and the crew the provisions and
ammunition taken out of the ship were carefully deposited in a place
where they would be sheltered from the inclemency of the weather the
alcoholic liquors were allowed to remain on board until the time
arrived for quitting the scene of the shipwreck and during the three
months of the expedition's stay here not a single theft of rum or of
brandy came to light although no one had anything to drink but pure
water

the efforts of the whole of the expedition were steadily applied to the
task of trying to repair the main injuries sustained by the uranie
with the exception of a few sailors told off to provide by hunting and
fishing for the subsistence of the community the lakes were
frequented by numbers of sea-lions geese ducks teal and snipe but
it was no easy matter to procure at one time a sufficient quantity of
these animals to serve for the food of the entire crew at the same
time the expenditure of powder was necessarily considerable as good
luck would have it gulls abounded in sufficient numbers to furnish a
hundred and twenty men with food for four or five months and these
creatures were so stupid as to allow themselves to be knocked on the
head with a stick a few horses were also killed which had relapsed
into a wild state since the departure of the colony founded by
bougainville

by the 28th february the painful conclusion was come to that with the
slender resources available it was impracticable to repair the damage
done to the uranie especially as the original injury had been
aggravated by the repeated shocks occasioned by thumping on the beach
"what was to be done?" should the explorers calmly wait until some
vessel chanced to put in at berkeley sound? this would be to leave the
sailors with nothing to do and this enforced idleness would open the
door to disorder and insubordination would it not be better to build a
small vessel out of the wreckage of the uranie? as it happened there
was a large sloop belonging to the ship if the sides were raised and
a deck added it might be possible to reach monte video and there
obtain the assistance of a vessel capable of bringing off in safety the
members of the expedition and all the cargo worth preserving this
latter plan met with the approval of freycinet and a decision once
come to not a moment was wasted

the sailors animated with fresh energy rapidly pushed on the work
now was proved the sound judgment of the commander when manning the
corvette at toulon in selecting sailors who were also skilled in some
mechanical employment blacksmiths sail-makers rope-makers sawyers
all worked with zeal at the different tasks assigned to them

no doubts were entertained of the success of the voyage before them
monte video was separated from the falkland islands by but three
hundred and fifty nautical miles and with the winds prevailing in
these latitudes at this time of year this distance could be traversed
in a few days by the esperance for so the transformed sloop was
named to provide at the same time against the possible contingency
of the frail vessel failing to reach the rio de la plata freycinet
determined to commence the construction of a schooner of a hundred
tons as soon as the sloop had taken her departure notwithstanding the
incessant demands on the energies of all made by the arduous and varied
tasks involved in reconstruction and refitting of the new vessel the
usual astronomical and physical observations the natural history
researches and the hydrographical surveys were not neglected no one
could have imagined that the stay in berkeley sound was anything more
than an ordinary halt for exploring purposes

at last the sloop was finished and safely launched the instructions
for captain duperrey appointed to take command were all drawn up the
crew was selected the provisions were on board in two days the
adventurers were to sail when on the 19th march 1820 the cry was
raised "a sail a sail" a sloop under full sail was seen entering the
bay

a cannon was fired several times to attract attention and in a short
time the master of the new arrival was on shore in a few words
freycinet explained to him the misadventure which had led to the
residence of the explorers upon this desolate coast the master stated
in reply that he was under the orders of the captain of an american
ship the general knox engaged in the seal-fishery at west island
to the west of the falklands an officer was at once deputed to go and
ascertain from the captain what succour he could render to the french
travellers the result of the interview was a demand for 135750 francs
for the conveyance of the shipwrecked strangers to rio an unworthy
advantage to take of the necessities of the unfortunate to such a
bargain the french officer was unwilling to agree without the consent
of his commander so he begged the american captain to sail for
berkeley sound while these negotiations were going on however
another ship the mercury under command of captain galvin had made
its appearance in the bay the mercury was bound from buenos ayres to
valparaiso with cannon but just before doubling cape horn she had
sprung a leak and was compelled to put in at the falkland islands to
make the necessary repairs it was a fortunate incident for the
frenchmen who knew they could turn to account the competition which
must result from the arrival of two ships

[illustration the mercury at anchor in berkeley sound]

freycinet at once made an offer to captain galvin to repair the damage
the mercury had sustained with the materials and the labour at his
command asking in return for this service a free passage for himself
and his companions to rio de janeiro

at the end of fifteen days the repairs of the mercury were completed
while they were going on the negotiation with the general knox was
terminated by a positive refusal on the part of freycinet to agree to
the extravagant terms proposed by the american captain it took several
days to come to a settlement with captain galvin who finally made the
following agreement

1 captain galvin engaged to convey to rio the wrecked persons their
papers collections and instruments as well as all the cargo saved
out of the uranie that could be got on board

2 freycinet and his people were during the passage to subsist entirely
on the provisions set apart for them

3 that the captain was to receive the sum of 97740 francs within ten
days of their arrival at rio by the acceptance of these truly
extortionate conditions a bargain which had cost much dispute was
finally settled

before leaving the falklands however the naturalist gaudichaud
planted its destitute shores with several sorts of vegetables which he
thought likely to be of service to future voyagers who might be
detained there

a few particulars regarding this archipelago will not be without
interest the group lying between 50 degrees 57 minutes and 52
degrees 45 minutes s latitude and 60 degrees 4 minutes 63 degrees 48
minutes west of the meridian of paris consists of several islets and
two principal islands named conti and maidenland berkeley sound
situated in the extreme east of the conti island is a wide opening
rather deep than extensive with a shelving rocky coast the
temperature of the islands is milder than one would expect from the
high latitude snow does not fall in any great quantity and does not
remain even on the summits of the highest hills longer than for about
two months the streams are never frozen and the lakes and marshes are
never covered with ice hard enough to bear the weight of a man for
more than twenty-four hours consecutively from the observations of
weddell who visited these parts between 1822 and 1824 the temperature
must have risen considerably during the last forty years in consequence
of a change in the direction taken by the icebergs which melt away in
the mid-atlantic m quoy the naturalist judging from the shallowness
of the sea between the falkland islands and south america as well as
the resemblance of their grassy plains to the pampas of buenos ayres
is of opinion that they once formed part of the continent these plains
are low marshy covered with tall grass and shrubs and are inundated
in the winter peat is abundant and makes excellent fuel the character
of the soil has proved an obstacle to the growth of the trees which
bougainville endeavoured to acclimatize of which scarce a vestige
remained at the time of freycinet's visit the plant which reaches the
greatest height and grows most plentifully is a species of sword-grass
excellent food for cattle and serving also as a place of shelter to
numbers of seals and multitudes of gulls it is this high grass which
sailors have taken from a distance for bushes the only vegetables
growing on these islands of any use to man are celery scurvy-grass
watercress dandelion raspberries sorrel and pimpernel

both french and spanish colonists had at different times imported into
these islands oxen horses and pigs which had multiplied to a
singular extent in the island of conti but the persistent hunting of
them by the crews of the whaling ships must tend to considerably reduce
their numbers the only quadruped indigenous to the falkland islands is
the antarctic dog the muzzle of which strikingly resembles that of the
fox it has therefore had the name dog-fox or wolf-fox given to it by
whalers these animals are so fierce that they rushed into the water to
attack byron's sailors they however find rabbits enough whose
reproductive powers are limitless to satisfy them but the seals
which the dogs attack without any fear manage to escape from them

the mercury set sail on the 28th of april 1821 to convey freycinet
and his crew to the port of rio de janeiro but one point captain
galvin had failed to take into his reckoning his ship equipped under
the flag of the independent state of buenos ayres then at war with the
portuguese would be seized on entering the harbour of rio and he
himself with all his crew would be made prisoners on this he
endeavoured to make freycinet cancel the engagement between them
hoping to prevail on him to land at monte video but as freycinet would
not agree to this proposal on any ground a new contract had to be
substituted for the original one according to the latter arrangement
freycinet became proprietor of the mercury on behalf of the french
navy by payment of the sum stipulated under the first contract the
ship was renamed the physicienne and reached monte video on the 8th
of may where the command was taken over by freycinet the stay at
monte video was made use of for arming the vessel arranging its trim
repairing the rigging taking on board the supply of water and
provisions requisite for the trip to rio de janeiro before reaching
which port however several serious defects in the ship had been
discovered the appearance of the physicienne was so distinctly
mercantile that on entering the port of rio though the flag of a
man-of-war was flying at the masthead the customs officers were
deceived and proposed to inspect her as a merchant-vessel extensive
repairs were absolutely necessary and the making of them compelled
freycinet to remain at rio until the 18th of september he was then
able to take his departure direct for france and on the 13th of
november 1820 he cast anchor in the port of havre after an absence
of three years and two months during which time he had sailed over
18862 nautical miles

a few days after his return freycinet proceeded to paris suffering
from a severe illness and forwarded to the secretary of the academy of
sciences the scientific records of the voyage which made no less than
thirty-one quarto volumes at the same time the naturalists attached
to the expedition mm quoy gaimard and gaudichaud submitted the
specimens which they had collected among these were four previously
unknown species of mammiferous animals forty-five of fishes thirty of
reptiles besides rare kinds of molluscs polypes annelides &c &c

the rules of the french service required that freycinet should be
summoned before a council of war to answer for the loss of his ship
the trial terminated in a unanimous verdict of acquittal from all
blame the council expressing at the same time their hearty
acknowledgment of the energy and ability displayed by the commander
approving moreover the skilful and careful measures he had taken to
remedy the disastrous results of his shipwreck a few days after being
received by the king louis xviii his majesty accompanying him to
the door said "you entered here the captain of a frigate you depart
the captain of a ship of the line offer me no thanks reply in the
words used by jean bart to louis xiv 'sire you have done well'"

from that time freycinet devoted himself entirely to the task of
publishing the notes of his travels the meagre account which has been
given here will serve to show how extensive these notes were but the
extreme conscientiousness of the explorer prevented him from publishing
anything which was not complete and he was bent on placing his work in
advance of the recognized boundaries of knowledge at that date even
the mere classification of the vast quantity of material which he had
collected during his voyage demanded a large expenditure of time thus
it was that when surprised by death on the 18th of august 1842 he had
not put the last finishing touch to one of the most curious and novel
divisions of his work that relating to the languages of oceania with
special reference to that of the marianne islands

at the close of the year 1821 the marquis de clermont tonnerre then
minister of marine received the scheme of a new voyage from two young
officers mm duperrey and dumont d'urville the former second in
command to freycinet on board the uranie after having rendered
valuable assistance to the expedition by his scientific researches and
surveys had within the year returned to france the other the
colleague of captain garnier had brought himself into notice during
the hydrographical cruises in the mediterranean and black seas which
it had fallen to captain garnier to complete he had a fine taste for
botany and art and had been one of the first to draw attention to the
artistic value of the venus of milos which had just been discovered
these two young savants proposed in the plan submitted by them to
make special researches into three departments of natural
science magnetism meteorology and the configuration of the globe
"in the geographical department" said duperrey "we would propose to
verify or to rectify either by direct or by chronometrical
observations the position of a great number of points in different
parts of the globe especially among the numerous island groups of the
pacific ocean notorious for shipwrecks and so remarkable for the
character and the form of the shoals sandbanks and reefs of which
they in part consist also to trace new routes through the dangerous
archipelago and the society islands side by side with those taken by
quiros wallis bougainville and cook to carry on hydrographical
surveys in continuation of those made in the voyages of d'entrecasteaux
and of freycinet in polynesia new holland and the molucca islands
and particularly to visit the caroline islands discovered by magellan
about which with the exception of the eastern side examined in our
own time by captain kotzebue we have only very vague information
communicated by the missionaries and by them learnt from stories told
by savages who had lost their way and were driven in their canoes upon
the marianne islands the languages character and customs of these
islanders must also receive special and careful attention"

the naval doctors garnon and lesson were placed in charge of the
natural history department whilst the staff was composed of officers
most remarkable for their scientific attainments among whom may be
mentioned mm lesage jacquinot bérard lottin de blois and de
blosseville

the academy of sciences took up the plan of research submitted by the
originators of this expedition with much enthusiasm and furnished them
with minute instructions in which were set forth with care the points
on which accurate scientific information was especially desirable at
the same time the instruments supplied to the explorers were the most
finished and complete of their kind

the vessel chosen for the expedition was the coquille a small ship
not drawing more than from twelve to thirteen feet of water which was
lying in ordinary at toulon the time spent in refitting stowing the
cargo arming the ship prevented the expedition from starting earlier
than the 11th of august 1822 the island of teneriffe was reached on
the 28th of the same month and there the officers hoped to be able to
make a few gleanings after the rich harvest of knowledge which their
predecessors had reaped but the council of health in the island
having received information of an outbreak of yellow fever on the
shores of the mediterranean imposed on the coquille a quarantine of
fifteen days it happened however that at that period political
opinion was in a state of fervid excitement at teneriffe and party
spirit ran so high in society that the inhabitants found it hard to
come together without also coming to blows under these circumstances
it is easy to imagine that the french officers did not indulge in
violent regrets over the privations which they had to sustain the
eight days during which their stay at teneriffe lasted were given up
exclusively to the revictualling of the ship and to magnetic and
astronomical observations

towards the end of september anchor was weighed and on the 6th of
october the work of surveying the islands of martin-vaz and of trinidad
was commenced the former are nothing more than bare rocks rising out
of the sea of a most forbidding aspect the island of trinidad is high
land rugged and barren with a few trees crowning the southern point
this island is none other than the famous ascençao now called
ascension which for three centuries had been the object of exploring
research in 1700 it was taken possession of by the celebrated halley
in the name of the english government but it had to be ceded to the
portuguese who formed a settlement there la pérouse found it still in
existence at the same place in 1785 the settlement which turned out
expensive and useless was abandoned a short time after the visit just
referred to and the island was left in the occupation of the dogs
pigs and goats whose progenitors had entered the island in company
with the early colonists

when he left the island of trinidad duperrey purposed to steer a
direct course for the falkland islands but an accidental damage in
the repair of which no time was to be lost compelled him to alter his
course for the island of st catherine where only he could obtain
without any delay the wood required for new yards and masts as well as
provisions which from their abundance could there be bought very
cheap as he drew near to the island he was delighted with the grand
and picturesque scene presented by its dense forests where
laurel-trees sassafras cedars orange-trees and mangroves
intermingled with banana and other palms with their feathery foliage
waving gracefully in the breeze just four days before the corvette
anchored off st catherine brazil had cast off the authority of the
mother-country and declared its independence by the proclamation of
prince don pedro d'alcantara as emperor this led the commander to
despatch a mission consisting of mm d'urville de blosseville gabert
and garnot to the capital of the island nossa-senhora-del-desterro to
make inquiries about the political change and learn how far it might
modify the friendly relations of the country with france it appeared
that the administration of the province was in the hands of a junto
but orders were at once given to allow the french travellers to cut
what wood they might stand in need of and the governor of the fort of
santa cruz was requested to further the scientific inquiries of the
expedition by all the means at his command as to provisions however
there was considerable difficulty for the merchants had transferred
their funds to rio in apprehension of what the political change might
result in it is probable that this circumstance accounts for the
commander of the coquille finding the course of business not run
smooth in a port which had received the warm recommendations of
captains kruzenstern and kotzebue

the narrative of the travellers states that "the inhabitants were
living in expectation of the island being shortly attacked with the
view to recolonization which they considered would be tantamount to
their enslavement the decree issued on the 1st august 1822 calling
on all brazilians to arm themselves for the defence of their shores and
proclaiming under all circumstances a war of partisans had given rise
to these fears the measures which prince don pedro propounded were
equally generous and vigorous and had created a favourable opinion of
his character and of his desire to promote freedom full of confidence
in his purposes the strong party in favour of independence were filled
with enthusiasm expressing itself all the more boisterously as for so
long a time their fervid aspirations had been kept under restraint
they now gave open demonstration of their joy by making the towns of
nossa-senhora-del-desterro laguna and san francisco one blaze of
light with their illuminations and marching through the streets
singing verses in honour of don pedro"

but the excitement which had been thus strikingly manifested in the
towns was not shared by the quiet peace-loving dwellers in the rural
districts to whose breasts political passion was an entire stranger
and there cannot be a doubt that if portugal had been in a position to
enforce her decrees by the despatch of a fleet the province would have
been easily reconquered

the coquille set sail again on the 30th october when to the east of
rio de la plata she was caught in one of those formidable gales there
called pampero but had the good fortune to weather it without
sustaining any damage

while in this part of the ocean duperrey made some interesting
observations on the current of the plate river freycinet had already
established the fact of its flowing at the rate of two miles and a half
an hour at a distance of a hundred leagues to the east of monte video
it was reserved to the commander of the coquille to ascertain that
the current is sensibly felt at a much greater distance he proved
moreover that the water of the river resisted by that of the ocean is
forcibly divided into two branches running in the direction of the two
banks of the river at its mouth and finally he accounts for the
comparative shallowness of the sea down to the shores of the magellan
strait by the immense residuum of earth held in suspension by the
waters of the la plata and deposited daily along the coast of south
america

before entering berkeley sound the coquille driven by a favourable
breeze passed immense shoals of whales and dolphins flocks of gulls
and numerous flying fish the ordinary tenants of those tempestuous
regions the falkland isles were reached and duperrey with a few of
his fellow-travellers felt a lively pleasure at revisiting the land
which had been to them a place of refuge for three months after their
shipwreck in the uranie they paid a visit to the spot where the camp
had been pitched the remains of the corvette were almost entirely
imbedded in sand and what was visible of it bore marks of the
appropriations which had been made by the whalers who had followed them
in that place on all sides were scattered miscellaneous fragments
carronades with the knobs broken off pieces of the rigging tattered
clothes shreds of sails unrecognizable rags mingled with the bones
of the animals which the castaways had killed for food "this scene of
our recent calamity" duperrey observes "wore an aspect of desolation
which was rendered still gloomier by the barrenness of the land and the
dark rainy weather prevailing at the time of our visit nevertheless
it had for us an inexplicable sort of attraction and left a melancholy
impression on our minds which was not effaced till long after we had
left the falkland islands well behind us"

[illustration the wreck of the uranie]

the stay of duperrey at the falklands was prolonged to the 17th
december he took up his residence in the midst of the ruins of the
settlement founded by bougainville in order to execute certain repairs
which the condition of his vessel required the crew provided
themselves by fishing and hunting with an ample supply of food
everything necessary was found in abundance except fruit and
vegetables and having laid in abundant stores all prepared to
confront the dangers of the passage round cape horn

at first the coquille had to struggle against strong winds from the
south-west and violent currents these were succeeded by squalls and
hazy weather until the island of mocha was reached on the 19th january
1823 of this island a brief mention has already been made duperrey
places it in 38 degrees 20 minutes 30 seconds s lat and 76 degrees
21 minutes 55 seconds w long and reckons it to be about twenty-four
miles in circumference consisting of a chain of mountains of moderate
elevation sloping down towards the sea it was the rendezvous of the
early explorers of the pacific it furnished the ships touching there
now a merchantman now a pirate with horses and with wild pigs the
flesh of which had a well-known reputation for delicacy of flavour
here was also a good supply of pure fresh water as well as of some
european fruits such as apples peaches and cherries the growth of
trees planted here by those who first took possession of the island in
1823 however these resources had all but disappeared through the
wasteful practices of improvident whalers at no great distance might
be seen the two round eminences which mark the mouth of the river
bio-bio the small island of quebra-ollas and that of quiriquina and
these passed the bay of conception opened to view where was a
solitary english whaler about to double the cape to which was
entrusted the correspondence for home as well as the notes of the work
that had already been accomplished

on the day after the arrival of the coquille as soon as the morning
sun had lit up the bay the melancholy and desolate appearance of the
place which had taken every one by surprise on the previous evening
became still more depressing the name of the town was talcahuano and
the picture it presented was one of houses in ruins and silent streets
a few wretched canoes ready to fall to pieces were on the beach near
them loitered a few poorly clad fishermen while in front of the
tumble-down cottages and roofless huts sat women in rags employed in
combing one another's hair in contrast with this human squalor the
surrounding hills and woods the gardens and the orchards were clothed
in the most splendid foliage on every side flowers displayed their
gorgeous colours and fruits proclaimed their ripeness in tints of
gold

overhead a glowing sun a sky without a cloud completed the bitter
irony of the spectacle all this ruin desolation and wretchedness
were the outward and visible signs of a series of revolutions at st
catherine the french travellers had been witnesses of the declaration
of brazilian independence on the opposite side of the continent they
were spectators of the downfall of director o'higgins this official
had evaded the summons of the congress had sacrificed the interests of
the agricultural community to those of the traders and merchants by
the imposition of direct taxes and the lowering of customs duties was
openly accused as well as his ministers of peculation and as the
result of all this malversation the greater part of the population had
risen in revolt the movement against o'higgins was led by a general d
ramon freire y serrano who gave formal assurances to the explorers
that the political disturbance should be no impediment to the
revictualling of the coquille

on the 26th january two corvettes arrived at conception they brought a
regiment under the command of a french official colonel beauchef who
came to assist general freire the regiment which had been organized
by the exertions of colonel beauchef was in point of steadiness
discipline and knowledge of drill one of the smartest in the chilian
army

on the 2nd february the officers of the coquille proceeded to
conception to pay a visit to general freire the nearer they
approached the city the more fields were lying waste the more ruined
houses were seen the fewer people were visible while their clothing
had almost reached the vanishing-point at the entrance of the town
itself stood a mast with the head of a notorious bandit affixed to the
top one benavidez a ferocious savage more wild beast than man whose
name was long execrated in chili for the horrible atrocities he had
committed

the interior of the town was found as desolate in appearance as the
approach to it having been set fire to by each party that had
successively been victorious conception was nothing more than a heap
of ruins amongst which loitered a little remnant of scantily clothed
inhabitants the wretched residuum of a once flourishing population
grass was growing in the streets the bishop's palace and the cathedral
were the only buildings still standing and these roofless and gutted
would not be able much longer to resist the dilapidating influence of
the climate

general freire before placing himself in opposition to o'higgins had
arranged a peace with the araucanians an indigenous tribe
distinguished for their bravery who had not only maintained their own
independence but were always ready when opportunity offered to
encroach on the spanish territory some of these natives were employed
as auxiliary troops in the chilian army duperrey saw them and having
obtained from general freire and colonel beauchef trustworthy
information has given a not very flattering description of them of
which the substance shall be here given

the araucanians are of an ordinary stature in complexion
copper-coloured with small black vivacious eyes a rather flat nose
and thick lips the result of which is an expression of brutal
ferocity divided into tribes each one jealous of another all
animated by an unbridled lust of plunder and ever on the move their
lives are spent in perpetual warfare the mounted araucanian is armed
with a long lance a long cutlass sabre-shaped called a
"machete"[5] and the lasso in the use of which they are extremely
expert while the horse he rides is usually swift

[footnote 5 this is a weapon shorter than a sword and longer than a
dagger trans]

"sometimes they are known" says duperrey "to receive under their
protection vanquished enemies and become their defenders but the
motive prompting them to this seemingly generous conduct is always one
of special vindictiveness the fact being that their real object is the
total extermination of some tribe allied with the opposite party among
themselves hatred is the ruling passion it is the only enduring bond
of fidelity all display undoubted courage spirit recklessness
implacability towards their enemies whom they massacre with a shocking
insensibility haughty in manner and revengeful in disposition they
treat all strangers with unqualified suspicion but they are hospitable
and generous to all whom they take as friends all their passions are
easily excited but they are inordinately sensitive with regard to
their liberty and their rights which they are ever ready to defend
sword in hand never forgetting an injury they know not how to
forgive nothing less than the life-blood of their enemies can quench
their thirst for vengeance"

duperrey pledges himself to the truth of the picture which he has here
drawn of these savage children of the andes who at least deserve the
credit of having from the sixteenth century to the present day managed
to preserve their independence against the attacks of all invaders

after the departure of general freire and the troops he led away with
him duperrey took advantage of the opportunity to get his vessel
provisioned as quickly as possible the water and the biscuits were
soon on board but longer time was necessary to procure supplies of
coal which however was to be got without any other expense save that
of paying the muleteers who transported it to the beach from a mine
scarcely beneath the level of the earth where it was to be picked up
for nothing

although the events happening at conception during the detention there
of the coquille were far from being cheerful the prevailing
depression could not hold out against the traditional festivities of
the carnival dinners receptions and balls recommenced and the
departure of the troops made itself felt only in the paucity of
cavaliers the french officers in acknowledgment of the hospitable
welcome offered to them gave two balls at talcahuano and several
families came from conception for the sole purpose of being present at
them

unfortunately duperrey's narrative breaks off at the date of his
quitting chili and there is no longer any official record from which
to gather the details of a voyage so interesting and successful far
from being able to trace step by step from original documents the
course of the expedition as has been done in the case of other
travellers we are obliged in our turn to epitomize other epitomes now
lying before us it is an unpleasing task as little agreeable to the
reader as it is difficult for the writer who while bound to respect
facts is no longer able to enliven his narrative with personal
observations and the generally lively stories of the travellers
themselves however some few of the letters of the navigator to the
minister of marine have been published from which have been extracted
the following details

on the 15th february 1823 the coquille set sail from conception for
payta the place where in 1595 alvarez de mendana and fernandez de
quiros took ship on the voyage of discovery that has made their names
famous but after a fortnight's sail the corvette was becalmed in the
vicinity of the island of laurenzo and duperrey resolved to put in at
callao to obtain fresh provisions it need not be said that callao is
the port of lima so the officers could not lose the opportunity of
paying a visit to the capital of peru they were not fortunate in the
time of their visit the ladies were away for sea-bathing at
miraflores and the men of most distinction in the place had gone with
them the travellers were thus compelled to rest content with an
inspection of the chief residences and public buildings of the city
returning to callao on the 4th march on the 9th of the same month the
coquille anchored at payta

the situation of this place between the terrestrial and magnetic
equators was most favourable for conducting observations on the
variations of the magnetic needle the naturalists also made excursions
to the desert of pierra where they collected specimens of petrified
shells imbedded in a tertiary stratum precisely similar to that in the
suburbs of paris as soon as all the sources of scientific interest at
payta had been exhausted the coquille resumed her voyage setting
sail for otaheite during the sail thither a circumstance occurred
which might have materially delayed the progress of the expedition if
not have led to its total destruction on the night of the 22nd april
the coquille being in the waters of the dangerous archipelago the
officer of the watch all at once heard the sound of breakers dashing
over reefs he immediately made the ship lie to and at daybreak the
peril which had been escaped became manifest at the distance of barely
a mile and a half from the corvette lay a low island well wooded and
fringed with rocks along its entire extent a few people lived on it
some of whom approached the vessel in a canoe but none of them would
venture on board duperrey had to give up all thoughts of visiting the
island which received the name of clermont-tonnerre on all sides the
waves broke violently on the rocks and he could do no more than coast
it from end to end at a little distance

the next and following days some small islands of no note were
discovered to which were given the names of augier freycinet and
lostanges

at length as the sun rose on the 3rd may the verdant shores and woody
mountains of otaheite came in sight duperrey like preceding visitors
could not help noticing the thorough change which had been effected in
the manners and practices of the natives not a canoe came alongside
the coquille it was the hour of divine worship when the corvette
entered the bay of matavai and the missionaries had collected the
whole population of the island to the number of seven thousand inside
the principal church of papahoa to discuss the articles of a new code
of laws the otaheitan orators it seems would not yield the palm to
those of europe there were not a few of them gifted with the valuable
talent of being able to talk for several hours without saying anything
and to make an end of the most promising undertakings with the flowers
of their rhetoric a description of one of these meetings is given by
d'urville

"m lejeune the draughtsman of the expedition went by himself to be
present at the meeting held the next day when certain political
questions were submitted to the popular assembly it lasted for several
hours during which the chiefs took it in turn to speak the most
brilliant speaker of the gathering was a chief called tati the chief
point of discussion was the imposition of an annual poll-tax at the
rate of five measures of oil per man then came a question as to the
taxes which were to be levied whether they should be on behalf of the
king or on behalf of the missionaries after some time we arrived at
the conclusion that the first question had been answered in the
affirmative but that the second the one relating to the missionaries
had been postponed by themselves from a forecast of its probable
failure about four thousand persons were present at this kind of
national congress"

two months before otaheite had renounced the english flag in order to
adopt one of its own but that pacific revolution in no wise diminished
the confidence which the people placed in their missionaries the
latter received the french travellers in a friendly manner and
supplied them at the usual prices with the stores of which they stood
in need

but what seemed especially curious in the reforms effected by the
missionaries was the total change in the behaviour of the women from
being according to the statements of cook bougainville and
contemporary explorers compliant to an unheard of degree they had
become most modest reserved and decently conducted so that the whole
island wore the air of a convent a revolution as amusing as it was
unnatural

from otaheite the coquille proceeded to the adjacent island of
borabora belonging to the same group where european customs had been
adopted to the same extent and on the 9th june steering a westerly
course made a survey in turn of the islands salvage coa santa cruz
bougainville and bouka finally coming to an anchor in the harbour of
praslin on the coast of new ireland famous for its beautiful
waterfall "the friendly relations which were established with the
natives there were the means of extending our knowledge of the human
race by the observation of some peculiarities which had not fallen
under the notice of preceding travellers" the sentence just quoted
from an abridged account appearing in the "annals of voyages" which
merely excites curiosity without satisfying it causes us here to
express our regret that the original narrative of the voyage has not
been published in its entirety

[illustration the waterfall of port praslin (fac-simile of early
engraving)]

the student porel de blossville the same who afterwards lost his life
with the lilloise in the polar regions undertook a journey to the
village of praslin in spite of all the means adopted by the savages to
deter him when there he was shown a kind of temple where several
ill-shaped grotesque idols had been set up on a platform surrounded by
walls

great pains were taken to prepare a chart of st george's channel
after which duperrey paid a visit to the islands previously surveyed by
schouten to the north-east of new guinea three days the 26th 27th
and 28th were devoted to a survey of them the explorer after this
searched ineffectually for the islands stephen and de carteret and
after comparing his own route with that taken by d'entrecasteaux in
1792 he came to the conclusion that this group must be identical with
that of providence discovered long since by dampier

on the 3rd of september the north cape of new guinea was recognized
three days later the coquille entered the narrow and rocky harbour of
offak on the north-west coast of waigiou one of the papuan islands
the only navigator who has mentioned this harbour is forest duperrey
therefore felt unusual satisfaction at having explored a corner of the
earth all but untrodden by the foot of the european it was also an
interesting fact for geographers that the existence of a southern bay
separated from offak by a very narrow isthmus was established

two officers mm d'urville and de blossville were employed in this
work which mm berard lottin and de blois de la calande connected
with that accomplished by duperrey on the coast during the cruise of
the uranie this land was found to be particularly rich in vegetable
products and d'urville was able there to form the nucleus of a
collection as valuable for the novelty as the beauty of its specimens

d'urville and lesson full of curiosity to study the inhabitants who
belonged to the papuan race started for the shore immediately after
the corvette arrived at the island in a boat manned with seven sailors
they had already walked some distance in a deluge of rain when all at
once they found themselves opposite a cottage built upon piles and
covered over with leaves of the plane-tree

cowering amongst the bushes at a little distance was a young female
savage who seemed to be watching them a few paces nearer was a heap
of about a dozen cocoa-nuts freshly gathered placed well in sight
apparently intended for the refreshment of the visitors the frenchmen
came to understand that this was a present offered by the youthful
savage of whom they had caught a glimpse and proceeded to feast on the
fruits so opportunely placed at their disposal the native girl soon
gathering confidence from the quiet behaviour of the strangers came
forward crying "bongous" (good) making signs to show that the
cocoa-nuts had been presented by herself her delicate attention was
rewarded by the gift of a necklace and earrings

when d'urville regained the boat he found a dozen papuans playing
eating and seeming on the best possible terms with the boatmen "in a
short time" he says "they had surrounded me repeating 'captain
bongous' and offering various tokens of good will these people are
in general of diminutive stature their constitution is slight and
feeble leprosy is a common disease among them their voice is soft
their behaviour grave polite and even marked with a certain air of
melancholy that is habitually characteristic of them"

[illustration natives of new guinea (fac-simile of early engraving)]

among the antique statues of which the louvre is full there is one of
polyhymnia which is celebrated above the rest for an expression of
melancholy pensiveness not usually found among the ancients it is a
singular circumstance that d'urville should have observed among the
papuans the very expression of countenance distinguishing this antique
statue on board the corvette another company of natives were
conducting themselves with a calmness and reserve offering a marked
contrast to the usual manner of the greater part of the inhabitants of
the lands of oceania

the same impression was made on the french travellers during a visit
paid to the rajah of the island as also during his return visit on
board the coquille in one of the villages on this southern bay was
observed a kind of temple in which were to be seen several rudely
carved statues painted over with various colours and ornamented with
feathers and matting it was quite impossible to obtain the slightest
information on the subject of the worship which the natives paid to
these idols

the coquille set sail again on the 16th september coasting along the
north side of the islands lying between een and yang and after a brief
stay at cayeli reached amboyna where the remarkably kind reception
given by m merkus the governor of the molucca island afforded the
staff an interval of rest from the continual labours of this
troublesome voyage the 27th october saw the corvette again on its
course steering towards timor and westward of the turtle and lucepara
islands duperrey next determined the position of the island of vulcan
sighted the islands of wetter baba dog cambing and finally
entering the channel of ombay surveyed a large number of points in the
chain of islands stretching from pantee and ombay in the direction of
java after having made a chart of java and an ineffectual search for
the trial islands in the place usually assigned to them duperrey
steered for new holland but through contrary winds was not able to
sail along the western coast of the island on the 10th january he at
length rounded van diemen's island and six days after that sighted the
lights of port jackson coming to an anchor off sydney the following
day

the governor sir thomas brisbane who had received previous intimation
of the arrival of the expedition gave the officers a cordial welcome
forwarded with all the means at his command the revictualling of the
corvette and rendered friendly assistance in the repairs which the
somewhat shattered condition of the ship rendered necessary he also
provided means to enable mm d'urville and lesson to make an excursion
full of interest beyond the blue mountains into the plain of bathurst
the resources of which were as yet but imperfectly known to europeans

duperrey did not leave australia until the 20th of march on this
occasion he directed his course towards new zealand which had been
rather overlooked in former voyages the vessel came to an anchor in
the bay of manawa forming the southern part of the grand bay of
islands here the officers occupied their leisure in scientific and
geographical observations and in making researches in natural history
at the same time the frequent intercourse of the explorers with the
natives threw quite a new light upon their manners their religious
notions their language and on their attitude of hostility up to that
time to the teaching of the missionaries what these savages most
appreciated in european civilization was well-finished weapons of
which at that time they possessed a great quantity for by their help
they were the better able to indulge their sanguinary instincts

the stay of the coquille at new zealand terminated on the 17th of
april when a détour was made northwards as far as rotuma
discovered but not visited by captain wilson in 1797 the
inhabitants gentle and hospitable took great pains to furnish the
navigators with the provisions they required but it was not long
before the frenchmen discovered that these gentle islanders taking
advantage of the confidence which they had known how to create had
carried off a number of articles that it afterwards cost much trouble
to make them restore stringent orders were given and all thieves
caught in the act were flogged in the presence of their
fellow-countrymen who however as well as the culprits themselves
treated the affair only as a joke

among these savages four europeans were observed who had a long time
before deserted from the whale-ship rochester they were no better
clothed than the natives and were tatooed and smeared with a yellow
powder after the native fashion so that it would have been hard to
recognize them but for their white skins and more intelligent looks
they were quite content with their lot having married wives and reared
families at rotuma where escaping the cares the troubles and the
difficulties of civilized life they reckoned on ending their days in
comfort one among them asked to be allowed to remain on board the
coquille a favour which duperrey was ready to grant but the chief
of the island was unwilling until he learned that two convicts from
port jackson asked permission to stay on shore

although these people hitherto little known offered a most
interesting subject of study to the naturalists it was necessary to
depart so the coquille proceeded to survey the coral isles and st
augustin discovered by maurelle in 1781 then came drummond island
where the inhabitants dark complexioned with slight limbs and
unintelligent faces offered to exchange some triangular shells
commonly called holy water cups for knives and fishhooks next the
islands of sydenham and henderville where the inhabitants go entirely
naked after them woolde hupper hall knox charlotte mathews
which form the gilbert archipelago and finally the marshall and
mulgrave groups

on the 3rd of june duperrey came in sight of the island of ualan which
had been discovered in 1804 by an american captain croser as it was
not marked upon any chart the commander decided upon making an exact
and particular survey of it no sooner had the anchor touched the
bottom than duperrey accompanied by some of his officers made for the
shore the inhabitants turned out to be a mild and obliging race who
made their visitors presents of cocoa-nuts and the fruit of the
bread-tree conducting them through most picturesque scenery to the
dwelling of their principal chief or "uross-ton" as he was called
dumont d'urville has given the following sketch of the country through
which the travellers passed on their way to the residence of the chief

"we glided calmly across a magnificent basin girdled in by a
well-wooded shore the foliage a bright green behind us rose the lofty
hill-tops carpeted with verdure from which shot up the light and
graceful stems of the cocoa palms out of the sea to the front rose the
little island of leilei covered with the pretty cottages of the
islanders and crowned with a verdant mound if this pleasant prospect
be further brightened by a magnificent day in a delicious climate
some notion may be formed of the sensations we experienced as we
proceeded in a sort of triumphal procession surrounded by a crowd of
simple gentle kind attendants"

the number of persons accompanying the boats d'urville estimated at
about 800 on arriving before a neat and charming village with well
paved streets they divided themselves the men standing on one side
the women on the other maintaining an impressive silence two chiefs
advanced and taking the travellers by the hand conducted them to the
dwelling of the "uross-ton" the crowd still silent remained outside
while the frenchmen entered the chief's house the "uross-ton" shortly
made his appearance a pale and shrivelled old man bowed down under
the weight of fourscore years the frenchmen politely rose on his
entering the room but they were apprised by a whisper of disapproval
from those standing about that this was a violation of the local
etiquette the crowd in front prostrated themselves on the ground the
chiefs themselves could not withhold that mark of respect the old man
recovering from a momentary surprise at the boldness of the strangers
called upon his subjects to keep silence then seated himself near the
travellers in return for the trifling presents which were made to him
and his wife he vouchsafed marks of goodwill in the shape of slight
pats on the cheek the shoulder or the thigh but the gratitude of
these sovereigns was expressed only by the gift of seven so-called
"tots" probably pieces of cloth four of which were of very fine
tissue

[illustration meeting with the chief of ualan]

after the audience was over the travellers proceeded to look round the
village where they were astonished to find two immense walls made of
coral some blocks of which were of immense size and weight

notwithstanding a few acts of petty theft committed by the chiefs the
ten days during which the expedition remained at the island passed
without disturbance the good understanding on which the intercourse
between the frenchmen and the ualanese was based never suffered a
moment's interruption duperrey remarks that "it is easy to predict
that this island of ualan will one day become of considerable
importance it is situated in the midst of the caroline group in the
course of ships sailing from new holland to china and presents good
ports for careening vessels ample supplies of water and provisions of
various kinds the inhabitants are generous and peaceably disposed and
they will soon be in a position to supply a kind of food most essential
to sailors from the progeny of the sows that we left with them a gift
which excited a very lively gratitude"

subsequent events however have not verified the forecast made by
duperrey although a route from europe to china by the south of van
diemen's island passes near the coast of ualan the island is of
little more value now than it was fifty years ago steam has completely
revolutionized the conditions of navigation sailors at the
commencement of the century could not possibly foresee the radical
changes which the introduction of this agent would produce

the coquille had not gone more than two days' sail from ualan when
on the 17th 18th and 23rd june were discovered several new islands
which by the native inhabitants were called pelelap takai aoura
ougai and mongoul these are the groups usually called mac-askyll and
duperrey the people resembling those of ualan who as well as those
of the radak islands give to their chiefs the title of "tamon"

on the 24th of the same month the coquille found herself in the
middle of the hogoleu group which kotzebue had looked for in too high
a latitude the commander recognizing their bearings by means of
certain names given by the natives which were found entered in the
chart of father cantova the hydrographical survey of this group
contained within a circumference of at least thirty leagues was
executed by m blois from the 24th to the 27th june the islands are
for the most part high terminating in volcanic peaks but some are of
opinion judging from the arrangement of the lagoon that they are of
madreporic formation they are tenanted by a race of diminutive
badly-shaped people subject moreover to repulsive complaints if ever
the converse of the phrase mens sana in corpore sano can find a just
application it must be here for these natives are low in the scale of
intelligence and inferior by many degrees to the people of ualan even
at that time foreign styles of dress appeared to have found their way
into the islands some of the people were wearing conical-shaped hats
after the chinese fashion others had on garments of plaited straw
with a hole in the middle to allow the head to pass through reminding
one of the "poncho" of the south american but they held in contempt
such trumpery as looking-glasses necklaces or bells asking rather
for axes and steel weapons evidences of frequent intercourse with
europeans

the islands of tamatan fanendik and ollap called "the martyrs" on
old maps were next surveyed afterwards an ineffectual search was made
for the islands of namoureck and ifelouk about the position assigned to
them by arrowsmith and malaspina and then by way of continuing the
exploration of the north side of new guinea the coquille put in at
the port of doreï on the south-east coast of the island where a stay
was made until the 9th august

whether estimated by the addition made to natural history or to
geography or to astronomy or to science in general no more
profitable a sojourn could have been made than this the indigenous
inhabitants of new guinea belong to the purest race of papuans their
dwellings are huts built upon piles the entrance to them being made by
means of a piece of wood with notches cut in it to serve for steps
this is drawn up into the interior every night the natives dwelling on
the coast are always at war with those in the interior the harfous or
arfakis negroes

guided by a young papuan d'urville succeeded in making his way to the
place where these last-mentioned dwelt he found them gentle
hospitable courteous creatures not in the least like the portrait
drawn of them by their enemies

after the stay at new guinea the coquille again sailed through the
moluccas put in for a short time at sourabaya upon the coast of java
and on the 30th october reached the islands of bourbon and mauritius
at length having on the way stopped at st helena where the officers
paid a visit to the tomb of napoleon and at ascension where an
english colony had been established since 1815 the corvette entered
marseilles on the 24th april 1825 concluding a voyage that had
occupied thirty-one months and three days over 24894 nautical miles
without the loss of a single life or any cases of sickness and
without any damage being sustained by the ship a success in every way
so distinguished covered with glory the young commander of the
expedition and all its officers who had manifested such untiring
energy in the prosecution of scientific inquiries yielding a rich
harvest of valuable results

fifty-two charts and plans carefully drawn up collections of natural
specimens of all kinds both numerous and curious copious
vocabularies by the help of which it may be possible to throw new
light on the migrations of the oceanic peoples interesting
intelligence regarding the productions of the places visited the
condition of commerce and industrial pursuits observations relating to
the shape of the globe magnetical meteorological and botanical
researches such formed the bulk of the valuable freight of knowledge
brought home by the coquille the scientific world waited eagerly for
the time when this store of information should be thrown open to the
public

guinea first news of the fate of la pérouse vanikoro and its
inhabitants stay at guam amboyna and menado results of the
expedition


the expedition the command of which was entrusted to baron de
bougainville was strictly speaking neither a scientific voyage nor a
campaign of discovery its chief purpose was to unfurl the french flag
in the extreme east and to impress upon the governments of that region
the intention of france to protect her nationalities and her interests
everywhere and at all times the chief instructions given to the
commander were that he was to convey to the sovereign of cochin-china a
letter from the king together with some presents to be placed on
board the frigate thetis

m de bougainville was also whenever possible without such delays as
would prejudice the main object of the expedition to take hydrographic
surveys and to collect information upon the commerce productions and
means of exchange of the countries visited

two vessels were placed under the orders of m de bougainville one
the thetis was an entirely new frigate carrying forty-four cannons
and three hundred sailors no french frigate of this strength except
the boudeuse having ever before accomplished the voyage round the
world the other the sloop espérance had twenty carronades upon the
deck and carried a hundred and twenty seamen

the first of these vessels was under the direct orders of baron de
bougainville and his staff consisted of picked officers amongst whom
we may mention longueville lapierre and baudin afterwards captain
vice-admiral and rear-admiral the espérance was commanded by
frigate-captain de nourquer du camper who as second in command of the
frigate cleopatra had already explored a great part of the course of
the new expedition it numbered among its officers turpin afterwards
vice-admiral deputy and aide-de-camp of louis philippe eugène
penaud afterwards general officer and médéric malavois the future
governor of senegal

not one notable scientific man such as those who had been billeted in
such numbers on the naturalist and other circumnavigating vessels
had embarked upon those of baron de bougainville to whom it was a
constant matter of regret a regret intensified by the fact that the
medical officers with so many under their care could not be long
absent from the vessels when in port m de bougainville's journal of
the voyage opens with this judicious remark 

"it was not many years ago a dangerous enterprise to make a voyage
round the world and scarce half a century has elapsed since the time
when an expedition of this kind would have sufficed to reflect glory
upon the man who directed it this was 'the good old time' the golden
age of the circumnavigator and the dangers and privations against
which he had to struggle were repaid a hundredfold when rich in
valuable discoveries he hailed on his return the shores of his native
land but this is all over now the prestige has gone and we make
our tour of the globe nowadays as we should then have made that of
france"

what would baron yves-hyacinth potentien de bougainville the son of
the vice-admiral senator and member of the institut say to-day to
our admirable steamships of perfect form and charts of such minute
exactitude that distant voyages appear a mere joke

on the 2nd march 1824 the thetis quitted the roads at brest to take
up at bourbon her companion the espérance which having started
some time before had set sail for rio de janeiro a short stay at
teneriffe where the thetis was only able to purchase some poor wine
and a very small quantity of the provisions needed a view of the cape
verd islands and the cape of good hope in the distance and a hunt for
the fabulous island of saxemberg and some rocks no less fictitious
were the only incidents of the voyage to bourbon where the espérance
had already arrived

bourbon was at this time so familiar a point with the navigators that
there was little to be said about it when its two open roads of st
denis and st paul had been mentioned st denis the capital situated
on the north of bourbon and at the extremity of a sloping table-land
was properly speaking merely a large town without enclosure or
walls and each house in it was surrounded by a garden there were no
public buildings or places of interest worth mentioning except the
governor's palace situated in such a position as to command a view of
the whole road the botanic garden and the "jardin de naturalisation"
which dates from 1817 the former which is in the centre of the town
contains some beautiful walks unfortunately but little frequented and
it is admirably kept the eucalyptus the giant of the australian
forests the phormium tenax the new zealand hemp-plant the
casuarina (the pine of madagascar) the baobab with its trunk of
prodigious size the carambolas the sapota the vanilla combined to
beautify this garden which was refreshed by streams of sparkling
water the second upon the brow of a hill formed of terraces rising
one above the other to which several brooklets give life and
fertility was specially devoted to the acclimatisation of european
trees and plants the apple peach apricot cherry and pear-trees
which have thriven well have already supplied the colony with valuable
shoots the vine was also grown in this garden together with the
tea-plant and several rarer species amongst which bougainville noted
with delight the "laurea argentea" with its bright leaves

on the 9th june the two vessels left the roads of st denis after
having doubled the shoals of la fortune and saya de malha and passed
off the seychelles whilst among the atolls to the south of the maldive
islands which are level with the surface of the water and covered with
bushy trees ending in a cluster of cocoas they sighted the island of
ceylon and the coromandel coast and cast anchor before pondicherry

[illustration natives of pondicherry]

engraving)]

this part of india is far from answering to the "enchantress" idea
which the dithyrambic descriptions of writers who have celebrated its
marvels have led europeans to form the number of public buildings and
monuments at pondicherry will scarcely bear counting and when one has
visited the more curious of the pagodas and the "boilers" whose only
recommendation is their utility there is nothing very interesting
except the novelty of the scenes met with at every turn the town is
divided into two well-defined quarters the one called the "white
town" dull and deserted in spite of its coquettish-looking buildings
and the far more interesting "black town" with its bazaars its
jugglers its massive pagodas and the attractive dances of the
bayadères

"the indian population upon the coast of coromandel" says the
narrative "is divided into two classes the 'right-hand' and the
'left' this division originated under the government of a nabob
against whom the people revolted those who remained faithful to the
prince being distinguished by the designation of 'right-hand' and the
rest by that of 'left-hand' these two great tribes which divide
between them almost equally the entire population are in a chronic
state of hostility against the holders of the ranks and prerogatives
obtained by the friends of the prince the latter however retain the
offices in the gift of the government whilst the others are engaged in
commerce to maintain peace amongst them it was necessary to allow them
to retain their ancient processions and ceremonies the 'right-hand'
and 'left-hand' are subdivided into eighteen castes or guilds full of
pretensions and prejudices not diminished even by the constant
intercourse with europeans which has now for centuries been maintained
hence have arisen feelings of rivalry and contempt which would be the
source of sanguinary wars were it not that the hindus have a horror of
bloodshed and that their temperament renders them averse to conflict
these two facts ie the gentleness of the native disposition and the
constant presence of an element of discord amongst the various tribes
must ever be borne in mind if we would understand the political
phenomenon of more than fifty millions of men submitting to the yoke of
some five and twenty or thirty thousand foreigners"

the thetis and the espérance quitted the roadstead of pondicherry
on the 30th july crossed the sea of bengal sighted the islands of
nicobar and pulo-penang with its free port capable of holding 300
ships at a time they then entered the straits of malacca and remained
in the dutch port of that name from the 24th to the 26th july to
repair damages sustained by the espérance so that she might hold out
as far as manilla the intercourse of the explorers with the resident
and the inhabitants generally were all the more pleasant that it was
confirmed by banquets given on land and on board the thetis in honour
of the kings of france and the netherlands the dutch were expecting
soon to cede this station to the english and this cession took place
shortly afterwards it must be added with regard to malacca that in
point of fertility of soil pleasantness of situation and facilities
for obtaining all really necessary supplies it was superior to its
rivals

bougainville set out again on august 26th and was tossed about by
head-winds and troubled alike by calms and storms during the remainder
of his passage through the straits as these latitudes were more
frequented than any others by malay pirates the commandant placed
sentries on the watch and took all precautions against surprise
although his force was strong enough to be above fearing any enemy it
was no uncommon thing to see fly-boats manned by a hundred seamen and
more than one merchant-ship had recently fallen a prey to these
unmolested and incorrigible corsairs the squadron however saw
nothing to awake any suspicions and continued its course to singapore

the population of this town is a curious mixture of races and our
travellers met with europeans engaged in the chief branches of
commerce armenian and arabian merchants and chinese some planters
others following the various trades demanded by the requirements of the
population the malays who seemed out of place in an advancing
civilization either led a life of servitude or slept away their time
in indolence and misery whilst the hindus expelled from their country
for crime practised the indescribable trades which in all great cities
alone save the scum from dying of starvation it was only in 1819 that
the english procured from the malayan sultan of johore the right to
settle in the town of singapore and the little village in which they
established themselves then numbered but 150 inhabitants although
thanks to sir stamford raffles a town soon rose on the site of the
unpretending cabins of the natives by a wise stroke of policy all
customs-duties were abolished and the natural advantages of the new
city with its extensive and secure port were supplemented and
perfected by the hand of man

the garrison numbered only 300 sepoys and thirty gunners there were as
yet no fortifications and the artillery equipment consisted merely of
one battery of twenty cannons and as many bronze field-pieces indeed
singapore was simply one large warehouse to which madras sent cotton
cloth calcutta opium sumatra pepper java arrack and spices
manilla sugar and arrack all forthwith despatched to europe china
siam &c of public buildings there appeared to be none there were no
stores no careening-wharves no building-yards no barracks and the
visitors noticed but one small church for native converts

the squadron resumed its voyage on the 2nd september and reached the
harbour of cavité without any mishap meanwhile m du camper
commander of the espérance who had during a residence of some years
become acquainted with the principal inhabitants was ordered to go to
manilla that he might inform the governor-general of the philippines
of the arrival of the frigates the reasons of their visit &c and at
the same time gauge his feelings towards them and form some idea of
the reception the french might expect the recent intervention of
france in the affairs of spain placed them indeed in a very delicate
position with the then governor don juan antonio martinez who had
been nominated to his post by the very cortés which had just been
overthrown by their government the fears of the commandant however
were not confirmed for he met with the warmest kindness and most
cordial co-operation from the spanish authorities

cavité bay where the vessels cast anchor was constantly encumbered
with mud but it was the chief port in the philippine islands and
there the spaniards owned a very well supplied arsenal in which worked
indians from the surrounding districts who though skilful and
intelligent were excessively lazy whilst the thetis was being
sheathed and the extensive repairs necessary to the espérance were
being carried out the clerks and officers were at manilla seeing
about the supply of provisions and cordage the latter which was made
of "abaca" the fibre of a banana vulgarly called "manilla hemp"
although recommended on account of its great elasticity was not of
much use on board ship the delay at manilla was rendered very
disagreeable by earthquakes and typhoons which are always of constant
occurrence there on october 24th there was an earthquake of such
violence that the governor troops and a portion of the people were
compelled hastily to leave the town and the loss was estimated at
120000l many houses were thrown down eight people were buried in
the ruins and many others injured scarcely had the inhabitants begun
to breathe freely again when a frightful typhoon came to complete the
panic it lasted only part of the night of the 31st october and the
next day when the sun rose it might have been looked upon as a mere
nightmare had not the melancholy sight of fields laid waste and of the
harbour with six ships lying on their sides and all the others at
anchor almost entirely disabled testified to the reality of the
disaster all around the town the country was devastated the crops
were ruined the trees even the largest of them violently shaken the
village destroyed it was a heart-rending spectacle the espérance
had its main-mast and mizen-mast lifted several feet above deck and
its barricadings were carried off the thetis more fortunate than
its companion escaped almost uninjured in the dreadful tempest

the laziness of the workpeople and the great number of holidays in
which they indulge early decided bougainville to part for a time from
his convoy and on december 12th he set sail for cochin-china before
following the french to the little-frequented shores of that country
however we must survey with them manilla and its environs the bay of
manilla is one of the most extensive and beautiful in the world
numerous fleets might find anchorage in it and its two channels were
not yet closed to foreign vessels and in 1798 two english frigates had
been allowed to pass through them and carry off numerous vessels under
the very guns of the town the horizon is shut in by a barrier of
mountains ending on the south of the taal a volcano now almost
extinct but the eruptions of which have often caused frightful
calamities in the plains framed in rice plantations several hamlets
and solitary houses give animation to the scene opposite to the mouth
of the bay rises the town containing 60000 inhabitants with its
lighthouse and far-extending suburbs it is watered by the passig a
river issuing from bay lake and its exceptionally good situation
secures to it advantages which more than one capital might envy the
garrison without including the militia consisted at that time of 2200
soldiers and in addition to the military navy always represented by
some vessel at anchor a marine service had been organized for the
exclusive use of the colony to which the name of "sutil" had been
given either on account of the small size or the fleetness of the
vessels employed this service all appointments in which are in the
gift of the governor-general is composed of schooners and gun-sloops
intended to protect the coasts and the trading-vessels against the
pirates of sulu but it cannot be said that the organization imposing
as it is has achieved any great results of this bougainville gives
the following curious illustration in 1828 the suluans seized 3000 of
the inhabitants upon the coast of luzon and an expedition sent against
them cost 140000 piastres and resulted in the killing of six men

[illustration near the bay of manilla (fac-simile of early
engraving)]

great uneasiness prevailed in the philippines at the time of the visit
of the thetis and the espérance and a political reaction which had
steeped the metropolis in blood had thrown a gloom over every one on
december 20th 1820 a massacre of the whites by the indians in 1824
the mutiny of a regiment and the assassination of an ex-governor
senor de folgueras had been the first horrors which had endangered the
supremacy of the spanish

the creoles who with the tagalas were alike the richest and most
industrious classes of the true native population at this time gave
just cause for uneasiness to the government because they were known to
desire the expulsion of all who were not natives of the philippines
and when it is borne in mind that they commanded the native regiments
and held the greater part of the public offices it is easy to see how
great must have been their influence well might people ask whether
they were not on the eve of one of those revolutions which lost to
spain her fairest colonies

until the thetis reached macao she was much harassed by squalls
gales heavy showers and an intensity of cold felt all the more
keenly by the navigators after their experience for several months of a
temperature of 75-3/4 degrees fahrenheit scarcely was anchor cast in
the canton river before a great number of native vessels came to
examine the frigate offering for sale vegetables fish oranges and a
multitude of trifles once so rare now so common but always costly

"the town of macao" says the narrative "shut in between bare hills
can be seen from afar the whiteness of its buildings rendering it very
conspicuous it partly faces the coast and the houses which are
elegantly built line the beach following the natural contour of the
shore the parade is also the finest part of the town and is much
frequented by foreigners behind it the ground rises abruptly and the
façades of the buildings such as convents noticeable for their size
and peculiar architecture rise so to speak from the second stage
the whole being crowned by the embattled walls of the forts over which
floated the white flag of portugal

"at the northern and southern extremities of the town facing the sea
are batteries built in three stages and near the first but a little
further inland rises a church with a very effective portico and fine
external decorations numerous sampangs junks and fishing-boats
anchored close in shore give animation to the scene the setting of
which would be much brightened if the heights overlooking the town were
not so totally wanting in verdure"

situated as it is in the high road between china and the rest of the
world macao once one of the chief relics of portuguese colonial
prosperity long enjoyed exceptional privileges all of which were
however gone by 1825 when its one industry was a contraband trade in
opium

the thetis only touched at macao to leave some missionaries and to
hoist the french flag and bougainville set sail again on january 8th

nothing worthy of notice occurred on the voyage from macao to touron
bay arrived there bougainville learned that the french agent m
chaigneu had left hué for saigon with the intention of there
chartering a barque for singapore and in the absence of the only
person who could further his schemes he did not know with whom to open
relations fearing failure as an inevitable result of this
contretemps he at once despatched a letter to hué explaining the
object of his mission and expressing a wish to go with some of his
officers to saigon the time which necessarily elapsed before an answer
was received was turned to account by the french who minutely surveyed
the bay and its surroundings together with the famous marble rocks
the objects of the curious interest of all travellers touron bay has
been described by various authors notably by horsburgh as one of the
most beautiful and vast in the universe but such is not the opinion of
bougainville who thinks these statements are to be taken with a great
deal of reservation the village of touron is situated upon the
sea-coast at the entrance of the channel of faifoh from the right
bank of which rises a fort with glacis bastions and a dry moat built
by french engineers

the french being looked upon as old allies were always received with
kindness and without suspicion it had not apparently been so with
the english who had not been permitted to land whilst the sailors on
board the thetis were at once allowed to fish and hunt and to go and
come as they chose every facility for obtaining fresh provisions being
also accorded to them thanks to this latitude the officers were able
to scour the country and make interesting observations one of them m
de la touanne gives the following description of the natives "they
are rather under than over middle height and in this respect they
closely resemble the chinese of macao their skin is of a
yellowish-brown and their heads are flat and round their faces are
without expression their eyes are as melancholy but their eyebrows
are not so strongly marked as those of the chinese they have flat
noses and large mouths and their lips bulge out in a way rendered the
more disagreeable as they are always black and dirty from the habit
indulged in by men and women alike of chewing areca nut mixed with
betel and lime the women who are almost as tall as the men have not
a more pleasant appearance and the repulsive filthiness common to
both sexes is enough without anything else to deprive them of all
attractiveness"

[illustration women of touron bay]

what strikes one most is the wretchedness of the inhabitants as
compared with the fertility of the soil and this shocking contrast
betrays alike the selfishness and carelessness of the government and
the insatiable greed of the mandarins the plains produce maize yams
manioc tobacco and rice the flourishing appearance of which
testifies to the care bestowed upon them the sea yields large
quantities of delicious fish and the forests give shelter to numerous
birds as well as tigers rhinoceroses buffaloes and elephants and
troops of monkeys are to be met with everywhere some of them four feet
high with bodies of a pearl-grey colour black thighs and red legs
they wear red collars and white girdles which make them look just as
if they were clothed their muscular strength is extraordinary and
they clear enormous distances in leaping from branch to branch nothing
can be odder than to see some dozen of these creatures upon one tree
indulging in the most fantastic grimaces and contortions "one day"
says bougainville "when i was at the edge of the forest i wounded a
monkey who had ventured forth for a stroll in the sunshine he hid his
face in his hands and sent forth such piteous groans that more than
thirty of his tribe were about him in a moment i lost no time in
reloading my gun not knowing what i might have to expect for some
monkeys are not afraid of attacking men but the troop only took up
their wounded comrade and once more plunged into the wood"

another excursion was made to the marble rocks of the faifoh river
where are several curious caves one containing an enormous pillar
suspended from the roof and ending abruptly some distance from the
ground stalactites were seen but the sound of a water-fall was heard
from the further end the french also visited the ruins of an ancient
building near a grotto containing an idol and with a passage opening
out of one corner this passage bougainville followed it led him into
an "immense rotunda lighted from the top and ending in an arched
vault at least sixty feet high imagine the effect of a series of
marble pillars of various colours some from their greenish colour the
result of old age and damp looking as if cast in bronze whilst from
the roof hung down creepers now in festoons now in bunches looking
for all the world like candelabra without the lights above our heads
were groups of stalactites resembling great organ-pipes altars
mutilated statues hideous monsters carved in stone and even a
complete pagoda which however occupied but a very small space in the
vast enclosure fancy such a scene in an appropriate setting the whole
lit up with a dim and wavering light and you can perhaps form some
idea how it struck me when it first burst upon me"

on the 20th of january 1825 the espérance at last rejoined the
frigate and two days later two envoys arrived from the court at hué
with orders to ask bougainville for the letter of which he was the
bearer but as the latter had received orders to deliver it to the
emperor in person this request involved a long series of puerile
negotiations the formalities by which the cochin-chinese envoys were
so to speak hemmed in reminded bougainville of the anecdote of the
envoy and the governor of java who rivalling each other in their
gravity and diplomatic prudence remained together for twenty-four
hours without exchanging a word the commander was not the man to
endure such trial of patience as this but he could not obtain the
necessary authorization of his explorations and the negotiations ended
in an exchange of presents securing nothing in fact but an assurance
from the emperor that he would receive with pleasure a visit of the
french vessels to his ports if their captain and officers would
conform to the laws of the empire since 1817 the french had been
pretty well the only people who had done any satisfactory business with
the people of cochin-china a state of things resulting from the
presence of french residents at the court of hué on whom alone of
course depended the maintenance of the exceptionally cordial relations
so long established between them and the government to which they were
accredited

the two ships left touron bay on the 17th february for the anambas
archipelago which had not as yet been explored and on the 3rd of
march they came in sight of it and found it to bear no resemblance
whatever to the islands of the same name marked upon the english map
of the china sea bougainville was agreeably surprised to see a large
number of islands and islets the bays &c of which were sure to
afford excellent anchorage during the monsoons the explorers
penetrated to the very heart of the archipelago and made a
hydrographic survey of it whilst the small boats were engaged upon
this task two prettily built canoes approached from one of which a
man of about fifty came on board the thetis whose breast was seamed
with scars and from whose right-hand two fingers were missing the
sight of the rows of guns and ammunition however so terrified him
that he beat a hasty retreat to his canoe though he had already got as
far as the orlop-deck next day two more canoes approached manned by
fierce-looking malays bringing bananas cocoa-nuts and pineapples
which they bartered for biscuits a handkerchief and two small axes
several other interviews took place with islanders armed with the
kriss and short two-edged iron pikes who were very evidently pirates
by profession

although the french explored but a part of the anamba group the
information they collected was extremely interesting on account of its
novelty the first requisite of a large population is plenty of fresh
water and there is apparently very little of it in the anambas
moreover the cultivable soil is not very deep and the mountains are
separated by narrow ravines not by plains so that agriculture is all
but out of the question even the native trees with the exception of
the cocoa-palm are very stunted the population was estimated by a
native at not more than 2000 but bougainville thought even that too
high a figure the fortunate position of the anambas they are passed
by all vessels trading with china whichever route may be taken long
since brought them to the notice of navigators and we must attribute
to their lack of resources the neglect to which they have been
abandoned the small amount of cordiality and confidence met with by
bougainville from the inhabitants the high price of provisions and
the destructive nature of the monsoons in the sunda waters determined
him to cut short his survey and to make with all speed for java where
his instructions compelled him to touch the 8th of march was fixed for
the departure of the two vessels which sighted victory barren
saddle and camel islands passed through the gasper straits the
passage of which did not occupy more than two hours although it often
takes several days with an unfavourable wind and cast anchor at
surabaya where the explorers were met with the news of the death of
louis xviii and the accession of charles x as the cholera which had
claimed 300000 victims in java in 1822 was still raging bougainville
took the precaution of keeping his crew on board under shelter from the
sun and expressly forbade any intercourse with vessels laden with
fruit the use of which is so dangerous to europeans especially during
the rainy season then setting in in spite of these wise orders
however dysentery attacked the crew of the thetis and too many fell
victims to it

the town of surabaya is situated one league from the mouth of the
river and it can only be reached by towing up the stream its
approaches are lively and everything bears witness to the presence of
an active commercial population an expedition to the island of celebes
having exhausted the resources of the government and the magazines
being empty bougainville had to deal direct with the chinese
merchants who are the most bare-faced robbers on the face of the
globe and now resorted to all manner of cunning and knavery to get the
better of their visitors the stay at surabaya therefore left a very
disagreeable impression on all it was quite different however with
regard to the reception met with from the chief personages of the
colony for there was every reason to be satisfied with the conduct of
all connected with the government

to go to surabaya without paying a visit to the sultan of madura whose
reputation for hospitality had crossed the seas would have been as
impossible as it is to visit paris without going to see versailles and
trianon after a comfortable lunch on shore therefore the staff of
the two vessels set out in open carriages and four but the roads were
so bad and the horses so worn out that they would many a time have
stuck in the mud if men stationed at the dangerous places had not
energetically shoved at the wheels at last they arrived at bankalan
and the carriages drew up in the third court of the palace at the foot
of a staircase at the top of which the hereditary prince and the prime
minister awaited the arrival of the travellers prince adden engrate
belonged to the most illustrious family of the indian archipelago he
wore the undress uniform of a java chief consisting of a long flowered
petticoat of indian make scarcely allowing the chinese slippers to be
seen a white vest with gold buttons and a small skirted waistcoat of
brown cloth with diamond buttons a handkerchief was tied about his
head on which he wore a visor-cap his ease and dignity of bearing
alone saving him from looking like the grotesque figure of a carnival
amazon the palace or "kraton" consisted of a series of buildings with
galleries kept delightfully cool by awnings and curtains whilst
lustres tasty european furniture pretty hangings glass and crystal
ornaments decorated the vast halls and rooms a suite of private
apartments with no opening to the court but with a view of the
gardens is reserved for the "ratu" (sovereign) and the harem

the reception was cordial and the repast served in european style
was delicious "the conversation" says bougainville "was conducted in
english and many toasts were proposed the prince drinking our healths
in tea poured from a bottle and to which he helped himself as if it
had been madeira being head of the church as well as of the state he
strictly obeys the precepts of the koran never drinking wine and
spending a great part of his time at the mosque but he is not the less
sociable and his talk bears no trace of the austerity to be expected
in that of one who leads so regular a life this life is not however
all spent in prayer and the scenes witnessed by us would give a very
false impression if we did not know that great latitude is allowed on
this point to the followers of the prophet"

in the afternoon the frenchmen visited several coach-houses containing
very handsome carriages some of which built on the island were so
well-made that it was absolutely impossible to distinguish them from
those which had been imported some archery was then witnessed and
joined in after which on the return to the palace the visitors were
welcomed by the sound of melancholy music speedily interrupted
however by the barking and fantastical dancing of the prince's fool
who showed wonderful agility and suppleness to this dance or rather
to these postures of a bayadère succeeded the excitement of
vingt-et-un followed by well-earned repose next day there were new
entertainments and new exercises beginning with wrestling-matches for
grown men and for youths and proceeding with quail-fights and feats
performed by a camel and an elephant after lunch bougainville and his
party had a drive and some archery and witnessed sack-races
basket-balancing &c in this way they were told the sultan passed
all his time most striking is the respect and submission shown by all
to this sovereign no one ever stands upright before him but all
prostrate themselves before addressing him all his subjects do but
"wait at his feet" and even his own little child of four years clasps
his tiny hands when he speaks to his father

while at surabaya bougainville took the opportunity of visiting the
volcano of brumo in the tengger mountains and this excursion in
which he explored the island for a hundred miles from east to west
was one of the most interesting undertaken by him surabaya contains
some curious buildings and monuments most of them the work of a former
governor general daendels such are the "builder's workshop" the
"hôtel de la monnaie" (the only establishment of the kind in java) and
the hospital which is built on a well-chosen site and contains 400
beds the island of madura opposite to surabaya is at least 100 miles
in length by fifteen or twenty in breadth and does not yield produce
sufficient to maintain the population sparse as it is the sovereignty
of this island is divided between the sultans of bankalan and sumanap
who furnish annually six hundred recruits to the dutch without
counting extraordinary levies

on the 20th april symptoms of dysentery showed themselves amongst the
crews two days later therefore the vessel set sail and it took seven
good days to get beyond the straits of madura they returned along the
north coast of lombok and passed through the allas straits between
lombok and sumbawa the first of these islands from the foot of the
mountains to the sea presents the appearance of a green carpet
adorned with groups of trees of elegant appearance and upon its coast
there is no lack of good anchorage whilst fresh water and wood are
plentiful on the other side however there are numerous peaks of
barren aspect rising from a lofty table-land the approach to which is
barred by a series of rugged and inaccessible islands known as lombok
the coral-beds and treacherous currents about which must be carefully
avoided two stoppages at the villages of baly and peejow with a view
to taking in fresh provisions enabled the officers to make a
hydrographical chart of this part of the coast of lombok upon leaving
the strait bougainville made an unsuccessful search for cloates
island that he did not find it is not very wonderful as during the
last eight years many ships have passed over the spot assigned to it
upon the maps the "triads" on the other hand ie the rocks seen in
1777 by the freudensberg castle are in captain king's opinion the
montepello islands which correspond perfectly with the description of
the danes

bougainville had instructions to survey the neighbourhood of the swan
river where the french government hoped to find a place suitable for
the reception of the wretches then huddled together in their
convict-prisons but the flag of england had just been unfurled on the
shores of nuyts and leuwin in king george's sound géographe bay the
little leschenault inlet and on the swan river so that there was no
longer any reason for a new exploration everything in fact had
combined to prevent it the delays to which the expedition had been
subjected had indeed been so serious that instead of arriving in these
latitudes in april they did not reach them until the middle of may
there the very heart of winter moreover the coast offers no shelter
for so soon as the wind begins to blow the waves swell tremendously
and the memory of the trials which the géographe had undergone at the
same season of the year was still fresh in the minds of the french the
thetis and the espérance were pursued by the bad weather as far as
hobart town the chief english station upon the coast of tasmania
where the commander was very anxious to put in he was however driven
back by storms to port jackson which is marked by a very handsome
lighthouse a granite tower seventy-six feet high with a lantern lit
by gas visible at a distance of nine leagues

[illustration entrance to sydney bay]

sir thomas brisbane the governor gave a cordial reception to the
expedition and at once took the necessary steps to furnish it with
provisions this was done by contract at low prices and the greatest
good faith was shown in carrying out all bargains the sloop had to be
run ashore to have its sheathing repaired but this with some work of
less importance necessary to the thetis did not take long the delay
was also turned to account by the whole staff who were greatly
interested in the marvellous progress of this penal colony while
bougainville was eagerly reading all the works which had as yet
appeared upon new south wales the officers wandered about the town
and were struck dumb with amazement at the numberless public buildings
erected by governor macquarie such as the barracks hospital market
orphanages almshouses for the aged and infirm the prison the fort
the churches government-house the fountains the town gates and last
but not least the government-stables which are always at first sight
taken for the palace itself there was however a dark side to the
picture the main thoroughfares though well-planned were neither
paved nor lighted and were so unsafe at night that several people had
been seized and robbed in the very middle of george street the best
quarter of sydney if the streets in the town were unsafe those in the
suburbs were still more so vagrant convicts overran the country in the
form of bands of "bushrangers" who had become so formidable that the
government had recently organized a company of fifty dragoons for the
express purpose of hunting them down all this did not however hinder
the officers from making many interesting excursions such as those to
paramatta on the banks of the nepean a river very deeply embanked
where they visited the regent ville district and to the "plains of
emu" a government agricultural-station and a sort of model farm they
went to the theatre where a grand performance was given in their
honour the delight sailors take in riding is proverbial and it was on
horseback that the french crossed the emu plains the noble animals
imported from england had not degenerated in new south wales they
were still full of spirit as one of the young officers found to his
cost when as he was saying in english to sir john cox acting as
cicerone to the party "i do love this riding exercise" he was
suddenly thrown over his horse's head and deposited on the grass before
he knew where he was the laugh against him was all the more hearty as
the skilful horseman was not injured

beyond sir john cox's plantations extends the unbroken "open forest"
as the english call it which can be crossed on horseback and consists
chiefly of the eucalyptus acacias of various kinds and the
dark-leaved casuarinas the next day an excursion was made up the
river nepean a tributary of the hawkesbury on which trip many
valuable facts of natural history were obtained bougainville enriching
his collection with canaries waterfowl and a very pretty species of
kingfisher and cockatoos in the neighbouring woods was heard the
unpleasant cry of the lyre-pheasant and of two other birds which
feebly imitate the tinkling of a hand-bell and the jarring noise of the
saw these are not however the only feathered fowl remarkable for the
peculiarity of their notes we must also mention the "whistling-bird"
the "knife-grinder" the "mocking-bird" the "coachman" which mimics
the crack of the whip and the "laughing jackass" with its continual
bursts of laughter which have a strange effect upon the nerves sir
john cox presented the commander with two specimens of the water-mole
also called the ornithorhynchus a curious amphibious creature the
habits of which are still little known to european naturalists many
museums not possessing a single specimen

another excursion was made in the blue mountains where the famous
"king's table-land" was visited from which a magnificent view was
obtained the explorers gained with great difficulty the top of an
eminence and an abyss of 1600 feet at once opened beneath them a vast
green carpet stretching away to a distance of some twenty miles whilst
on the right and left were the distorted sides of the mountain which
had been rudely rent asunder by some earthquake the irregularities
corresponding exactly with each other close at hand foams a roaring
rushing torrent flinging itself in a series of cascades into the
valley beneath the whole passing under the name of "apsley's
waterfall" this trip was succeeded by a kangaroo hunt in the
cow-pastures with mr macarthur one of the chief promoters of the
prosperity of new south wales bougainville also turned his stay at
sydney to account by laying the foundation-stone of a monument to the
memory of la pérouse this cenotaph was erected in botany bay upon the
spot where the navigator had pitched his camp

[illustration "apsley's waterfall"]

on september 21st the thetis and the espérance at last set sail
passing off pitcairn island easter island and juan fernandez now a
convict settlement for criminals from chili after having been occupied
for a half-century by spanish vine-growers

on the 23rd november the thetis which had been separated from the
espérance during a heavy storm anchored off valparaiso where it met
admiral de rosamel's division great excitement prevailed in the
roadstead for an expedition against the island of chiloë which still
belonged to spain was being organized by the chief director general
ramon freire y serrano of whom we have already spoken

bougainville like the russian navigator lütke is of opinion that the
position of valparaiso does not justify its reputation the streets are
dirty and narrow and so steep that walking in them is very fatiguing
the only pleasant part is the suburb of almendral which with its
gardens and orchards would be still more agreeable but for the
sand-storms prevalent throughout nearly the whole of the year in 1811
valparaiso numbered only from four to five thousand inhabitants but in
1825 the population had already tripled itself and the increase showed
no sign of ceasing when the thetis touched at valparaiso the
english frigate the blonde commanded by lord byron grandson of the
explorer of the same name whose discoveries are narrated above was
also at anchor there by a singular coincidence byron had raised a
monument to the memory of cook in the island of hawaii at the very
time when bougainville the son of the circumnavigator met by byron in
the straits of magellan was laying the foundation-stone of the
monument to the memory of la pérouse in new south wales

bougainville turned the delay necessary for the revictualling of his
division to account by paying a visit to santiago the capital of
chili thirty-three leagues inland the environs of chili are terribly
bare without houses or any signs of cultivation its steeples alone
mark the approach to it and one may fancy oneself still in the
outskirts when the heart of the city is reached there is however no
lack of public buildings such as the hôtel de la monnaie the
university the archbishop's palace the cathedral the church of the
jesuits the palace and the theatre the last of which is so badly
lighted that it is impossible to distinguish the faces of the audience
the promenade known as la cañada has now supplanted that of l'alameda
on the banks of the river mapocha once the evening rendezvous the
objects of interest in the town exhausted the frenchmen examined those
in the neighbourhood visiting the salto de agua a waterfall of 1200
feet in height the ascent to which is rather arduous and the cerito
de santa-lucia from which rises a fortress the sole defence of the
town

the season was now advancing and no time was to be lost if the
explorers wished to take advantage of the best season for doubling cape
horn on the 8th january 1826 therefore the two vessels once more
put to sea and rounded the cape without any mishap though landing at
the falklands was rendered impossible by fog and contrary winds anchor
was cast on the 28th march in the roadstead of rio janeiro and as it
turned out at a time most favourable for the french to form an
accurate opinion alike on the city and the court

"the emperor" says bougainville "was upon a journey at the time of
our arrival and his return was the occasion of fêtes and receptions
which roused the population to activity and broke for a time the
monotony of ordinary life in rio that dullest and dreariest of towns
to the foreigner its environs however are charming nature has in
them been lavish of her riches and the vast harbour the atlantic
rendezvous of the commercial world presents a most animated scene
innumerable ships either standing in or getting under weigh small
craft cruising about a ceaseless roar of cannon from the forts and
men-of-war exchanging signals on the occasion of some anniversary or
the celebration of some festival of the church whilst visits were
constantly being exchanged between the officers of the various foreign
vessels and the diplomatic agents of foreign powers at the court of
rio"

the division set sail again on the 11th april and arrived at brest on
the 24th june 1826 without having put into port since it left rio
janeiro we must remember that if bougainville did not make any
discoveries on this voyage he had no formal instructions to do so his
mission being merely to unfurl the flag of france where it had as yet
been rarely seen none the less do we owe to this general officer some
very interesting and in some cases new information on the countries
visited by him some of the surveys made by his expedition may be of
service to navigators and it must be owned that the hydrographical
researches which alone could be undertaken in the absence of scientific
men were carefully made and resulted in the obtaining of numerous and
accurate data we can but sympathize with the commander of the
thetis in his expression of regret in the preface to his journal
that neither the government nor the académie des sciences had seen
fit to turn his expedition to account to obtain new results
supplementary of the rich harvest gleaned by his predecessors

the expedition next sent out under the command of captain dumont
d'urville was merely intended by the minister to supplement and
consolidate the mass of scientific data collected by captain duperrey
in his voyage from 1822 to 1824 as second in command to duperrey and
the originator and organizer of the new exploring expedition d'urville
had the very first claim to be appointed to its command the portions
of oceania he proposed to visit were new zealand the fiji islands the
loyalty islands new britain and new guinea all of which he
considered urgently to demand the consideration alike of the geographer
and the traveller what he effected in this direction we shall
ascertain by following him step by step an interest of another
character also attaches to this trip but it will be well to quote on
this point the instructions given to the navigator

"an american captain" writes the minister of marine "said that he saw
in the hands of the natives of an isle situated between new caledonia
and the louisiade archipelago a cross of st louis and some medals
which he imagined to be relics of the wrecked vessel of the celebrated
la pérouse whose loss is so deeply and justly regretted this is of
course but a feeble reason for hoping that some of the victims of the
disaster still survive but you sir will give great satisfaction to
his majesty if you are the means of restoring any one of the poor
shipwrecked mariners to their native land after so many years of misery
and exile"

the aims of the expedition were therefore manifold and by the greatest
chance it was able to achieve them nearly all d'urville received his
appointment in december 1825 and was permitted himself to choose all
who were to accompany him he named as second in command lieutenant
jacquinot and as scientific colloborateurs messrs quoy and gaimard
who had been on board the uranie and as surgeon primevère lesson
the coquille the excellent qualities of which were well known to
d'urville was the vessel selected and the commander having named her
the astrolabe in memory of la pérouse embarked in her a crew of
twenty-four men anchor was weighed on the 25th april and the
mountains of toulon with the coast of france were soon out of sight

after touching at gibraltar the astrolabe stopped at teneriffe to
take in fresh provisions before crossing the atlantic and d'urville
took advantage of this delay to ascend the peak accompanied by messrs
quoy gaimard and several officers a bad road very arduous for
pedestrians leading the first part of the way over fields of scoria
though as laguna is approached the scenery improves this town of a
considerable size contains but a small indolent and miserable
population

between matunza and orotara the vegetation is magnificent and the
luxuriant foliage of the vine enhances the beauty of the view orotara
is a small seaboard town with a port affording but little shelter it
is well-built and laid out and would be comfortable enough if the
streets were not so steep as to make traffic all but impossible after
three-quarters of an hour's climb through well-cultivated fields the
frenchmen reached the chestnut-tree region beyond which begin the
clouds taking the form of a thick moist fog very disagreeable to the
traveller further on comes the furze region beyond which the
atmosphere again becomes clear vegetation disappears the ground
becomes poorer and more barren here are met with decomposed lava
scoria and pumice-stones in great abundance whilst below stretches
away the boundless sea of clouds

thus far hidden by clouds or by the lofty mountains surrounding it the
peak at last stands forth distinctly the incline becomes less steep
and those vast plains of intensely melancholy appearance called
cañadas by the spanish on account of their bareness are crossed a
halt is made for lunch at the pine grotto before climbing the huge
blocks of basalt ranged in a circle about the crater now filled in
with ashes from the peak and forming its enceinte the peak itself is
next attached the ascent of which is broken one-third of the way up by
a sort of esplanade called the estancia de los ingleses here our
travellers passed the night not perhaps quite so comfortably as they
would have done in their berths but without suffering too much from
the feeling of suffocation experienced by other explorers the fleas
however were very troublesome and their unremitting attacks kept the
commander awake all night

at four am the ascent was resumed and a second esplanade called the
alta vista was soon reached beyond which all trace of a path
disappears the rest of the ascent being over rough lava as far as the
chahorra cone with here and there in the shade patches of unmelted
snow the peak itself is very steep and its ascent is rendered yet
more arduous by the pumice-stone which rolls away beneath the feet

"at thirty-five minutes past six" says m dumont d'urville "we
arrived at the summit of the chahorra which is evidently a
half-extinct crater its sides are thin and sloping it is from sixty
to eighty feet deep and the whole surface is strewn with fragments of
obsidian pumice-stones and lava sulphureous vapour forming a kind
of crown of smoke is emitted from it whilst the atmosphere at the
bottom is perfectly cool at the summit of the peak the thermometer
marked 11 degrees but in my opinion it was affected by the presence of
the fumerolles for when at the bottom of the crater it fell rapidly
from 19 degrees in the sun to 9 degrees 5' in the shade"

the descent was accomplished without accident by another route
enabling our travellers to examine the cueva de la nieve and to visit
the forest of aqua garcia watered by a limpid stream and in which
d'urville made a rich collection of botanical specimens

in major megliorini's rooms at santa cruz the commander was shown
together with a number of weapons shells animals fish &c a
complete mummy of a guanche said to be that of a woman the corpse was
sewn up in skins and seemed to be that of a woman five feet four high
with regular features and large hands the sepulchral caves of the
guanches also contained earthenware wooden vases triangular seals of
baked clay and a great number of small discs of the same material
strung together like chaplets which may have been used by this extinct
race for the same purposes as the "quipos" of the peruvians

on the 21st june the astrolabe once more set sail and touched at la
praya and at the cape verd islands where d'urville had hoped to meet
captain king who would have been able to give him some valuable hints
on the navigation of the coast of new guinea king however had left
la praya thirty-six hours previously and the astrolabe therefore
resumed her voyage the next day ie on the 30th june

on the last day of july the rocks of martin-vaz and trinity island were
sighted and the latter appearing perfectly barren a little dried-up
grass and a few groups of stunted trees dotted about amongst the
rocks being the only signs of vegetation

d'urville had been very anxious to make some botanical researches on
this desert island but the surf was so rough that he was afraid to
risk a boat in it

on the 4th august the astrolabe sailed over the spot laid down as
"saxembourg" island which ought to be finally erased from french as it
has been from english charts and after a succession of squalls which
tried her sorely she arrived off st paul and amsterdam islands
finally anchoring on the 7th october in king george's sound on the
coast of australia in spite of the roughness of the sea and constant
bad weather throughout his voyage of 108 days d'urville had carried on
all his usual observations on the height of the waves which he
estimated at 80 and occasionally as much as 100 feet off needle bank
the temperature of the sea at various depths &c

captain jacquinot having found a capital supply of fresh water on the
right bank of princess royal harbour and at a little distance a site
suitable for the erection of an observatory the tents were soon
pitched by the sailors and several officers made a complete tour of
the bay whilst others opened relations with the aborigines one of
whom was induced to go on board though it was only with the greatest
difficulty that he was persuaded to throw away his banksia a cone
used to retain heat and to keep the stomach and the front part of the
body warm he remained quietly enough on board for two days however
eating and drinking in front of the kitchen fire in the meantime his
fellow-countrymen on land were peaceable and well-disposed even
bringing three of their children into the camp

during this halt a boat arrived manned by eight englishmen who asked
to be taken on board as passengers and told such a very improbable
story of having been deserted by their captain that d'urville
suspected them of being escaped convicts a suspicion which became a
conviction when he saw the wry faces they made at his proposal to send
them back to port jackson the next day however one took a berth as
sailor and two were received as passengers whilst the other five
decided to remain on land and drag out a miserable existence amongst
the natives

all this time hydrographical and astronomical observations were being
made and the hunters and naturalists were trying to obtain specimens
of new varieties of fauna and flora the delays extending to october
24th enabled the explorers to regain their strength after their trying
voyage to make the necessary repairs take in wood and water draw up
a map of the whole neighbourhood and to collect numerous botanical and
zoological specimens his observations of various kinds made d'urville
wonder that the english had not yet founded a colony on king george's
sound admirably situated as it is not only for vessels coming direct
from europe but for those trading between the cape and china or bound
for the sunda islands and delayed by the monsoons the coast was
explored as far as west port preferred by d'urville to port dalrymple
the latter being a harbour always difficult and often dangerous either
to enter or to leave west port moreover was as yet only known from
the reports of baudin and flinders and it was therefore better worth
exploring than a more frequented district the observations made in
king george's sound were therefore repeated at west port resulting in
the following conclusions 

"it affords" says d'urville "an anchorage alike easy to reach and to
leave the bottom is firm and wood is abundant and easily procurable
in a word when a good supply of fresh water is found and that will
probably be soon west port will rise to a position of great importance
in a channel such as bass's straits when the winds often blow strongly
from one quarter for several days together the currents at the same
time rendering navigation difficult"

from november 19th to december 2nd the astrolabe cruised along the
coast touching only at jervis bay remarkable for its magnificent
eucalyptus forests

the reception given to the french at port jackson by governor darling
and the colonial authorities was none the less cordial for the fact
that the visits made by d'urville to various parts of new holland had
greatly amazed the english government

during the last three years port jackson had increased greatly in size
and improved in appearance though the population of the whole colony
only amounted to 50000 and that in spite of the constant foundation
of new english settlements the commander took advantage of his stay in
sydney to forward his despatches to france together with several cases
of natural history specimens this done and a fresh stock of provisions
having been laid in he resumed his voyage

it would be useless to linger with dumont d'urville at new south wales
to the history of which and its condition in 1826 he devotes a whole
volume of his narrative we have already given a detailed account of
it and it will be better to leave sydney with our traveller on the
19th december and follow him to tasman bay through calms head-winds
currents and tempests which prevented his reaching new zealand before
the 14th january 1827 tasman bay first seen by cook on his second
voyage had never yet been explored by any expedition and on the
arrival of the astrolabe a number of canoes containing some score of
natives most of them chiefs approached these natives were not afraid
to climb on board some remaining several days whilst later arrivals
drew up within reach and a brisk trade was opened meanwhile several
officers climbed through the thick furze clothing the hills overlooking
the bay and the following is d'urville's verdict on the desolate scene
which met their view

"not a bird not an insect not even a reptile to be seen the solemn
melancholy silence is unbroken by the voice of any living creature"
from the summit of these hills the commander saw new bay that known as
admiralty which communicates by a current with that in which the
astrolabe was anchored and he was anxious to explore it as it
seemed safer than that of tasman but the currents several times
brought his vessel to the very verge of destruction and had the
astrolabe been driven upon the rocky coast the whole crew would have
perished and not so much as a trace of the wreck would have been left
at last however d'urville succeeded in clearing the passage with no
further loss than that of a few bits of the ship's keel

"to celebrate" says the narrative "the memory of the passage of the
astrolabe i conferred upon this dangerous strait the name of the
'passe des français'" (french pass) "but unless in a case of great
necessity i should not advise any one else to attempt it we could now
look calmly at the beautiful basin in which we found ourselves and
which certainly deserves all the praise given to it by cook i would
specially recommend a fine little harbour some miles to the south of
the place where the captain cast anchor our navigation of the 'passe
des français' had definitively settled the insular character of the
whole of the district terminating in the 'cape stephens' of cook it is
divided from the mainland of te-wahi-punamub[1] by the current basin
the comparison of our chart with that of the strait as laid down by
cook will suffice to show how much he left to be done"

[footnote 1 now "south island" trans]

the astrolabe soon entered cook's strait and sailing outside queen
charlotte's bay doubled cape palliser a headland formed of some low
hills d'urville was greatly surprised to find that a good many
inaccuracies had crept into the work of the great english navigator
and in that part of the account of his voyage which relates to
hydrography he quotes instances of errors of a fourth or even third
of a degree

the commander then resolved to make a survey of the eastern side of the
northern island ika-na-mawi on this island pigs were to be found but
no "pounamon" the green jade which the new zealanders use in the
manufacture of their most valuable tools strange to say however jade
is to be found on the southern island but there are no pigs

two natives of the island who had expressed a wish to remain on board
the corvette became quite low-spirited as they watched the coast of
the district where they lived disappear below the horizon they then
began to repent but too late the intrepidity which had prompted them
to leave their native shores for intrepid they justly deserve to be
called seeing that again and again they asked the french sailors if
they were not to be eaten and it took several days of kind treatment
to dispel this fear from their minds

[illustration new zealanders (fac-simile of early engraving)]

d'urville continued to sail northward up the coast until the capes
named by cook turn-again and kidnappers had been doubled and sterile
island with its "ipah" came in sight in the bay of tolaga as cook
called it the natives brought alongside the corvette pigs and
potatoes which they readily exchanged for articles of little value on
other canoes approaching the new zealanders who were on board the
vessel urged the commander to fire upon and kill their
fellow-countrymen in the boats but as soon as the latter climbed up to
the deck the first arrivals advanced to greet them with earnest
assurances of friendship conduct so strangely inconsistent is the
outcome of the compound of hatred and jealousy mutually entertained for
each other by these tribes "they all desire to appropriate to
themselves exclusively whatever advantage may be obtained from the
visits of foreigners and they are distressed at the prospect of their
neighbours getting any share" proof was soon afforded that this
explanation is the right key to their behaviour

upon the astrolabe were several new zealanders but among them was a
certain "shaki" who was recognized as a chief by his tall stature
his elaborate tattooing and the respectful manner in which he was
addressed by his fellow-islanders seeing a canoe manned by not more
than seven or eight men approaching the corvette this "shaki" and
the rest came to entreat d'urville most earnestly to kill the new
arrivals going so far as to ask for muskets that they might themselves
fire upon them however no sooner had the last comers arrived on board
than all those who were there already overwhelmed them with courtesies
while the "shaki" himself although he had been one of the most
sanguinary completely changed his tone and made them a present of some
axes he had just obtained after the chief men of a warlike and fierce
appearance with faces tattooed all over had been a few minutes on
board d'urville was preparing to ask them some questions with the aid
of a vocabulary published by the missionaries when all at once they
turned away from him leaped into their canoes and pushed out into the
open sea this sudden move was brought about by their countrymen who
for the purpose of getting rid of them slily hinted that their lives
were in danger as the frenchmen had formed a plot to kill them

it was in the bay of tolaga the right name of which is houa-houa that
d'urville found the first opportunity of gaining some information about
the "kiwi" by means of a mat decorated with the feathers of that bird
such mats being articles of luxury among these islanders the "kiwi" is
about the size of a small turkey and like the ostrich has not the
power of flying it is hunted at night by the light of torches and with
the assistance of dogs it is this bird which is also known under the
name of the "apteryx" what the natives told d'urville about it was in
the main accurate the apteryx with the tail of a fowl and a plumage
of a reddish-brown has an affinity to the ostrich it inhabits damp
and gloomy woods and never comes out even in search of food except in
the evening the incessant hunting of the natives has considerably
diminished the numbers of this curious species and it is now very
rare

d'urville made no pause in the hydrographical survey of the northern
island of new zealand keeping up daily communication with the natives
who brought him supplies of pigs and potatoes according to their own
statements the tribes were perpetually at war with one another and
this was the true cause of the decrease in the population of these
islands their constant demand was for fire-arms failing to obtain
these they were satisfied if they could get powder in exchange for
their own commodities

on the 10th february when not far from cape runaway the corvette was
caught in a violent storm which lasted for thirty-six hours and she
was more than once on the point of foundering after this she made her
way into the bay of plenty at the bottom of which rises mount
edgecumbe then keeping along the coast the islands of haute and major
were sighted but during this exploration of the bay the weather was
so severe that the chart of it then laid down cannot be considered very
trustworthy after leaving this bay the corvette reached the bay of
mercury surveyed barrier island entered shouraki or hauraki bay
identified the hen and chickens and the poor knights islands finally
arriving at the bay of islands the native tribes met with by d'urville
in this part of the island were busy with an expedition against those
of shouraki and waikato bays for the purpose of exploring the former
bay which had been imperfectly surveyed by cook d'urville sailed back
to it and discovered that that part of new zealand is indented with a
number of harbours and gulfs of great depth each one being safer if
possible than the other having been informed that by following the
direction of the wai magoia a place would be reached distant only a
very short journey from the large port of manukau he despatched some
of his officers by that route and they verified the correctness of the
information he had received this discovery observes dumont d'urville
may become of great value to future settlements of shouraki bay and
this value will be still farther increased should the new surveys prove
that the port of manukau is accessible to vessels of a certain size
for such a settlement would command two seas one on the east and the
other on the west

one of the "rangatiras" as the chiefs of that quarter of the island
are called rangui by name had again and again begged the commander to
give him some lead to make bullets with a request which was always
refused just before setting sail d'urville was informed that the
deep-sea lead had been carried off and he at once reproached rangui in
severe terms telling him that such petty larcenies were unworthy of a
man in a respectable position the chief appeared to be deeply moved by
the reproach and excused himself by saying that he had no knowledge of
the theft which must have been committed by some stranger "a short
time afterwards" the narrative goes on to say "my attention was drawn
to the side of the ship by the sound of blows given with great force
and piteous cries proceeding from the canoe of rangui there i saw
rangui and tawiti striking blow after blow with their paddles upon an
object resembling the figure of a man covered with a cloak it was easy
to perceive that the two wily chiefs were simply beating one of the
benches of the canoe after this farce had been played for some little
time rangui's paddle broke in his hands the sham man was made to
appear to fall down when rangui addressing me said that he had just
killed the thief and wished to know whether that would satisfy me i
assured him that it would laughing to myself at the artifice of these
savages an artifice for that matter such as is often to be met with
among people more advanced in civilization"

d'urville next surveyed the lovely island of wai-hiki and thus
terminated the survey of the astrolabe channel and hauraki bay he then
resumed his voyage in a northerly direction towards the bay of islands
sailing as far as cape maria van diemen the most northerly point of
new zealand where say the waïdonas "the souls of the departed gather
from all parts of ika-na-mawi to take their final flight to the realms
of light or to those of eternal darkness"

the bay of islands at the time when the coquille put in there was
alive with a pretty considerable population with whom the visitors
soon became on friendly terms now however the animation of former
days had given place to the silence of desolation the ipah or rather
the pah of kahou wera once the abode of an energetic tribe was
deserted war had done its customary destructive work in the place the
songhui tribe had stolen the possessions and dispersed the members of
the tribe of paroa

the bay of islands was the place chosen for their field of effort by
the english missionaries who notwithstanding their devotion to their
work had not made any progress among the natives the unproductiveness
of their labours was only too apparent

the survey of the eastern side of new zealand a hydrographical work of
the utmost importance terminated at this point since the days of cook
no exploration of anything like such a vast extent of the coast of this
country had been conducted in so careful a manner in the face of so
many perils the sciences of geography and navigation were both
signally benefited by the skilful and detailed work of d'urville who
had to give proof of exceptional qualities in the midst of sudden and
terrible dangers however on his return to france no notice was taken
of the hardships he had undergone or the devotion to duty he had
shown he was left without recognition and duties were assigned to
him the performance of which could bring no distinction for they
could have been equally well discharged by any ordinary ship's captain

leaving new zealand on the 18th of march 1827 d'urville steered for
tonga tabou identified to begin with the islands curtis macaulay and
sunday endeavoured but without success to find the island of vasquez
de mauzelle and arrived off namouka on the 16th of april two days
later he made out eoa but before reaching tonga tabou he encountered a
terrible storm which all but proved fatal to the astrolabe at tonga
tabou he found some europeans who had been for many years settled on
the island from them he received much help in getting to understand
the character of the natives the government was in the hands of three
chiefs called equis who had shared all authority between them since
the banishment of the tonï tonga or spiritual chief who had enjoyed
immense influence a wesleyan mission was in existence at tonga but it
could be seen at a glance that the methodist clergy had not succeeded
in acquiring any influence over the natives such converts as had been
made were held in general contempt for their apostasy

when the astrolabe had reached the anchorage after her fortunate
escape from the perils from contrary winds currents and rocks which
had beset her course she was at once positively overwhelmed with the
offer of an incredible quantity of stores fruits vegetables fowls
and pigs which the natives were ready to dispose of for next to
nothing for equally low prices d'urville was able to purchase for the
museum specimens of the arms and native productions of the savages
amongst them were some clubs most of them made of casuarina wood
skilfully carved or embossed in an artistic manner with
mother-of-pearl or with whalebone the custom of amputating a joint or
two of the fingers or toes to propitiate the deity was still
observed in the case of a near relative being dangerously ill

from the 28th of april the natives had manifested none but the most
friendly feelings no single disturbance had occurred but on the 9th
of may while d'urville with almost all his officers went to pay a
visit to one of the leading chiefs named palou the reception accorded
to them was marked by a most unusual reserve altogether inconsistent
with the noisy and enthusiastic demonstrations of the preceding days
the distrust evinced by the islanders aroused that of d'urville who
remembering how few were the men left on board the astrolabe felt
considerable uneasiness however nothing unusual happened during his
absence from the ship but it was only the cowardice of palou which had
caused the failure of a conspiracy aiming at nothing less than the
massacre at one blow of the whole of the staff after which there
would have been no difficulty in prevailing over the crew who were
already more than half-disposed to adopt the easy mode of life of the
islanders such at least was the conclusion the commander came to and
subsequent events showed that he was right

these apprehensions determined d'urville to leave tonga tabou as
quickly as possible and on the 13th every preparation was made to set
sail on the following day the apprentice dudemaine was walking about
on the large island whilst the apprentice faraquet with nine men was
engaged on the small island pangaï modou in getting fresh water or
studying the tide when tahofa one of the chiefs with several other
islanders then on board the astrolabe gave a signal the canoes
pushed off at once and made for the shore on trying to discover the
cause of this sudden retreat it was observed that the sailors on the
island pangaï modou were being forcibly dragged off by the natives
d'urville was about to fire off a cannon when he decided that it would
be safer to send a boat to shore this boat took off the two sailors
and the apprentice dudemaine but was fired upon when despatched
shortly afterwards to set fire to the huts and to try to capture some
natives as hostages one native was killed and several others were
wounded whilst a corporal of the marines received such severe bayonet
wounds that he died two hours later

[illustration attack from the natives of tonga tabou]

d'urville's anxiety about the fate of his sailors and of faraquet who
was in command of them knew no bounds nothing was left for him to do
but to make an attack upon the sacred village of mafanga containing
the tombs of several of the principal families but on the following
day a crowd of natives so skilfully surrounded the place with
embankments and palisades that it was impossible to hope to carry it
by an attack the corvette then drew nearer to the shore and began to
cannonade the village without however doing any other damage than
killing one of the natives at length the difficulty of obtaining
provisions the rain and the continual alarm in which the firing of
the frenchmen kept them induced the islanders to offer terms of peace
they gave up the sailors who had all been very well treated made a
present of pigs and bananas and on the 24th of may the astrolabe
took her final departure from the friendly islands

it was quite time indeed that this was done for d'urville's situation
was untenable and in a conversation with his boatswain he ascertained
that not more than half a dozen of the sailors could be relied on all
the others were ready to go over to the side of the savages

tonga tabou is of madreporic formation with a thick covering of
vegetable soil favourable to an abundant growth of shrubs and trees
the cocoa-tree the stem of which is slenderer than elsewhere and the
banana-tree here shoot up with wonderful rapidity and vigour the
aspect of the land is flat and monotonous so that a journey of one or
two miles will give as fair an impression of the country as a complete
tour of the island the number of the population who have the true
polynesian cast of countenance may be put down at about 7000 d'urville
says "they combine the most opposite qualities they are generous
courteous and hospitable yet avaricious insolent and always
thoroughly insincere the most profuse demonstration of kindness and
friendship may at any moment be interrupted by an act of outrage or
robbery should their cupidity or their self-respect be ever so
slightly roused"

in intelligence the natives of tonga are clearly far superior to those
of otaheite the french travellers could not sufficiently admire the
astonishing order in which the plantations of yams and bananas were
kept the excessive neatness of their dwellings and the beauty of the
garden-plots they even knew something of the art of fortification as
d'urville ascertained by an inspection of the fortified village of
hifo defended with stout palisades and surrounded by a trench between
fifteen and twenty feet wide and half filled with water

on the 25th of may d'urville began the exploration of the viti or fiji
archipelago at the outset he was so fortunate as to fall in with a
native of tonga who was living on the fiji islands for purposes of
trade and had previously visited otaheite new zealand and australia
this man as well as a guam islander proved most useful to the
commander in furnishing him with the names of more than 200 islands
belonging to this group and in acquainting him beforehand with their
position and that of the reefs in their neighbourhood at the same
time gressier the hydrographer collected all the materials requisite
for preparing a chart of the fiji islands

at this station a sloop was put under orders to proceed to the island
of laguemba where was an anchor which d'urville would have been well
pleased to obtain as he had lost two of his own while at tonga on
arrival at the island lottin who was in command of the sloop
observed on the shore none but women and children armed men however
soon came running up made the women leave the place and were
preparing to seize the sloop and make the sailors prisoners their
intentions were too plain to leave room for any doubt on the subject
so lottin at once gave orders to draw up the grapnel and got away into
the open sea before there was time for an encounter to take place

during eighteen consecutive days in the face of bad weather and a
rough sea the astrolabe cruised through the fiji archipelago
surveyed the islands of laguemba kandabou viti-levou oumbenga vatou
lele ounong lebou malolo and many others giving special attention
to the southern islands of the group which up to that period had
remained almost entirely unknown

the population of this group if we accept d'urville's account form a
kind of transition between the copper-coloured or the polynesian and
the black or melanesian races their strength and vigour are in
proportion to their tall figures and they make no secret of their
cannibal propensities

on the 11th of june the corvette set sail for the harbour of carteret
surveyed one by one the islands of erronan and annatom the loyalty
islands of which group d'urville discovered the chabrol and halgan
islands the little group of the beaupie islands the astrolabe reefs
all the more dangerous as they are thirty miles distant from the
beaupie islands and sixty from new caledonia the island of huon and
the chain of reefs to the north of new caledonia were subsequently
surveyed from this point d'urville reached the louisiade archipelago
in six days but the stormy weather there encountered determined him to
abandon the course he had planned out and not to pass through torres
straits he thought that an early examination of the southern coast of
new britain and of the northern coast of new guinea would be the most
conducive to the interests of science

rossel island and cape deliverance were next sighted and the vessel
was steered for new ireland with a view to obtaining fresh supplies of
wood and water arriving there on the 5th of july in such gloomy rainy
weather that it was with no small difficulty that the entrance of the
harbour of carteret where d'entrecasteaux made a stay of eight days
was made out whilst there the travellers received several visits from
the score of natives who seem to make up the total population of the
place they were creatures possessed of scarcely any intelligence and
quite destitute of curiosity about objects that they had not seen
before neither did their appearance lead to the slightest
prepossession in their favour they wore no vestige of clothing their
skin was black and their hair woolly and the partition of the nostrils
had a sharp bone thrust through by way of ornament the only object
that they showed any eagerness to possess was iron but they could not
be made to understand that it was only to be given in exchange for
fruits or pigs their expression was one of sullen defiance and they
refused to guide any one whatever to their village during the
unprofitable stay of the corvette in this harbour d'urville had a
serious attack of enteritis from which he suffered much for several
days

on the 19th july the astrolabe went to sea again and coasted the
northern side of new britain the object of this cruise was frustrated
by rainy and hazy weather continual squalls and heavy showers
compelled the vessel to put off again as soon as it had succeeded in
nearing the land his experience on this coast d'urville thus
describes "one who has not had as we have a practical acquaintance
with these seas is unable to form any adequate conception of these
incredible rains moreover to obtain a just estimate of the cares and
anxieties which a voyage like ours entails there must be a liability
to the call of duties similar to those which we had to discharge it
was very seldom that our horizon lay much beyond the distance of 200
yards and our observations could not possibly be other than uncertain
when our own true position was doubtful altogether the whole of our
work upon new britain in spite of the unheard of hardships that fell
to our lot and the risks which the astrolabe had to run cannot be
put in comparison for a moment as respects accuracy with the other
surveys of the expedition"

as it was impracticable to fall back upon the route by the st george's
channel d'urville had to pass through dampier's strait the southern
entrance to which is all but entirely closed by a chain of reefs which
were grazed more than once by the astrolabe

the charming prospect of the western coast of new britain excited
intense admiration both in dampier and d'entrecasteaux an enthusiasm
fully shared by d'urville a safe roadstead enclosed by land forming a
semicircle forests whose dark foliage contrasted with the golden
colour of the ripening fields the whole surmounted by the lofty peaks
of mount gloucester and this variety still further enhanced by the
undulating outlines of rook island are the chief features of the
picture here presented by the coast of new britain

[illustration lofty mountains clothed with dense and gloomy forests]

on issuing from the strait the mountains of new guinea rose grandly in
the distance and on a nearer approach they were seen to form a sort of
half-circle shutting in the arm of the sea known as the bay of
astrolabe the schouten islands the creek of the attack (the place
where d'urville had to withstand an onset of savages) humboldt bay
geelwinck bay the traitor islands tobie and mysory the arfak
mountains were one after another recognized and passed when the
astrolabe at length came to an anchor in port dorei in order to
connect her operations with those accomplished by the coquille

friendly intercourse was at once established with the papuans of that
place who brought on board a number of birds of paradise but not much
in the shape of provisions these natives are of so gentle and timid a
disposition that only with great reluctance will they risk going into
the woods through fear of the arfakis who dwell on the mountains and
are their sworn enemies

one of the sailors engaged in getting fresh water was wounded with an
arrow shot by one of these savages whom it was impossible to punish
for a dastardly outrage prompted by no motive whatever

the land here is everywhere so fertile that it requires no more than
turning over and weeding in order to yield the most abundant harvests
yet the papuans are so lazy and understand so little of the art of
agriculture that the growth of food plants is often allowed to be
choked with weeds the inhabitants belong to several races d'urville
divides them into three principal varieties the papuans a mixed
breed belonging more or less to the malay or polynesian race and the
harfous or alfourous who resemble the common type of australians new
caledonians and the ordinary black oceanic populations these latter
would appear to be the true indigenous people of the country

on the 6th september the astrolabe again put to sea and after an
uninteresting stay at new guinea in the course of which scarcely any
specimens of natural history were obtained except a few mollusca and
still less exact information regarding the customs religion or
language of its diversified population steered for amboyna which was
reached without any accident on the 24th september the governor m
merkus happened to be on circuit but his absence was no obstacle to
the supply of all the stores needed by the commander the reception
given by the authorities and the society of the place was of a very
cordial kind and everything was done to compensate the french
explorers for the hardships undergone in their long and troublesome
voyage

from amboyna d'urville proceeded to hobart town in tasmania a place
not visited by any french vessel since the time of baudin arriving on
the 27th december 1827 thirty-five years previously d'entrecasteaux
had met on the shores of this island only a few wretched savages and
ten years later baudin found it quite deserted the first piece of news
that dumont d'urville learnt on entering the river derwent before even
casting anchor at hobart town was that captain dillon an englishman
had received certain information when at tucopia of the shipwreck of
la pérouse at vanikoro and that he had brought away the hilt of a
sword which he believed to have belonged to that navigator on his
arrival at calcutta dillon communicated his information to the
governor who without delay despatched him with instructions to rescue
such of the shipwrecked crew as might still be alive and collect
whatever relics could be found of the vessels to d'urville this
intelligence was of the highest interest seeing that he had been
specially instructed to search for whatever might be calculated to
throw any light upon the fate of the unfortunate navigator and he had
while at namouka obtained proof of the residence for a time of la
pérouse at the friendly islands

in the english colony itself there was some difference of opinion as to
the credit which captain dillon's story was entitled to receive but
the report which that officer had made to the governor-general of
india quite removed any doubt from the mind of d'urville abandoning
therefore all further plans with reference to new zealand he decided
upon proceeding at once in the astrolabe in the track of dillon to
vanikoro which he then knew only by the name of mallicolo

[illustration natives of vanikoro (fac-simile of early engraving)]

the following is the statement of the circumstances as made by dillon

during a stay made by the ship hunter at the fiji islands three
persons a prussian named martin bushart his wife and a lascar
called achowlia were received on board endeavouring to escape from
the horrible fate awaiting them which had already befallen the other
european deserters settled in that archipelago that of being devoured
by the savages this unhappy trio merely begged to be put on shore at
the first inhabited island which the hunter might touch at
accordingly they were left on one of the charlotte islands tucopia
in 12 degrees 15 minutes s lat and 169 degrees w long in the month
of may 1836 dillon who had been one of the crew of the ship
hunter paid a visit to the island of tucopia with a view of
ascertaining what had become of the people put on shore in 1813 there
he found the lascar and the prussian the former of whom sold him a
silver sword-hilt as might have been expected dillon was curious to
know how the natives of that island had come into possession of such an
article the prussian then related that on his arrival at tucopia he
had found many articles of iron such as bolts axes knives spoons
and other things which he was told had come from mallicolo a group of
islands situated about two days canoe sail to the east of tucopia by
further interrogatories dillon learnt that two vessels had been thrown
upon the coasts many years previously one of which had perished
entirely with all on board whilst the crew of the second had
constructed out of the wreck of their ship a little boat in which they
had put to sea leaving some of their number at mallicolo the lascar
said he had seen two of these men who had acquired a well-merited
influence through services rendered to chiefs

dillon tried in vain to persuade his informant to take him to
mallicolo but was more successful with the prussian who took him
within sight of the island called research by d'entrecasteaux on
which however dillon was unable to land on account of the dead calm
and his want of provisions

on hearing his account on his arrival at pondicherry the governor
entrusted him with the command of a boat specially constructed for
exploring purposes this was in 1827 dillon now touched at tucopia
where he obtained interpreters and a pilot and thence went to
mallicolo where he learnt from the natives that the strangers had
stayed there five months to build their vessel and that they had been
looked upon as supernatural visitors an idea not a little confirmed by
their singular behaviour they had been seen for instance to talk to
the moon and stars through a long stick their noses were immense and
some of them always remained standing holding bars of iron in their
hands such was the impression left on the minds of the natives by the
astronomical observations cocked hats and sentinels of the french

dillon obtained from the natives a good many relics of the expedition
and he also saw at the bottom of the sea on the coral reef on which
the vessel had struck some bronze cannons a bell and all kinds of
rubbish which he reverently collected and carried to paris arriving
there in 1828 and receiving from the king a pension of 4000 francs as
a reward for his exertions all doubt was dispelled when the comte de
lesseps who had landed at kamtchatka from la pérouse's party
identified the cannons and the carved stern of the boussole and the
armorial bearings of colignon the botanist were made out on a silver
candlestick all these interesting and curious facts however
d'urville did not know until later at present he had only heard
dillon's first report by chance or perhaps because he was afraid of
being forestalled the captain had not laid down the position of
vanikoro or the route he followed on the way from tucopia which island
d'urville supposed to belong to the banks or santa cruz group each as
little known as the other

before following d'urville however we must pause with him for awhile
at hobart town which he looked upon even then as a place of remarkable
importance "its houses" he says "are very spacious consisting only
of one story and the ground-floor though their cleanness and
regularity give them a very pleasant appearance walking in the
streets which are unpaved though some have curb stones is very
tiring and the dust always rising in clouds is very trying to the
eyes the government house is pleasantly situated on the shores of the
bay and will be greatly improved in a few years if the young trees
planted about it thrive native timber is quite unsuitable for
ornamental purposes"

the stay at hobart town was turned to account to complete the stock of
provisions anchors and other very requisite articles and also to
repair the vessel and the rigging the latter being sorely dilapidated

on the 5th january the astrolabe once more put to sea surveyed
norfolk island on the 20th matthew volcano six days later erronan on
the 28th and the little mitre island on the 8th february arriving the
next day off tucopia a small island three or four miles in
circumference with one rather pointed peak covered with vegetation the
eastern side of tucopia is apparently inaccessible from the violence of
the breakers continually dashing on to its beach the eagerness of all
was now great and was becoming unbounded when three boats one
containing a european were seen approaching this european turned out
to be the prussian calling himself bushart who had lately gone with
dillon to mallicolo where the latter remained a whole month and where
he really obtained the relics of the expedition as d'urville had heard
at hobart town not a single frenchman now remained on the island the
last had died the previous year bushart at first consented but
declined at the last moment to go with d'urville or to remain on the
astrolabe

vanikoro is surrounded by reefs through which not without danger the
astrolabe found a passage casting anchor in the same place as dillon
had done namely in ocili bay the scene of the shipwreck was on the
other side of the bay it was not easy to get information from the
natives who were avaricious untrustworthy insolent and deceitful
an old man however was finally induced to confess that the whites who
had landed on the beach at vanon had been received with a shower of
arrows and that a fight ensued in which a good many natives had
fallen as for the maras (sailors) they had all been killed and
their skulls buried at vanon the rest of the bones had been used to
tip the arrows of the natives

a canoe was now sent to the village of nama and after considerable
hesitation the natives were induced by a promise of some red cloth to
take the frenchmen to the scene of the shipwreck about a mile off near
païon and opposite ambi where amongst the breakers at the bottom of a
sort of shelving beach anchors cannons and cannonballs and many
other things were made out leaving no doubt as to the facts in the
minds of the officers of the astrolabe it was evident to all that
the vessel had endeavoured to get inside the reefs by a kind of pass
and that she had run aground and been unable to get off the crew may
then have saved themselves at païon and according to the account of
some natives they built a little boat there whilst the other vessel
which had struck on the reef further out had been lost with all on
board

chief moembe had heard it said that the inhabitants of vanon had
approached the vessel to pillage it but had been driven back by the
whites losing twenty men and three chiefs the savages in their turn
had massacred all the french who landed except two who lived on the
island for the space of three months

another chief valiko by name said that one of the boats had struck
outside the reef opposite tanema after a very windy night and that
nearly all its crew had perished before they could land many of the
sailors of the second vessel had got to land and built at païon a
little boat out of the pieces of the large ship wrecked during their
stay at païon quarrels arose and two sailors with five natives of
vanon and one from tanema were killed at the end of five months the
frenchmen left the island

lastly a third old man told how some thirty sailors belonging to the
first vessel had joined the crew of the second and that they had all
left at the end of six or seven months all these facts which had so
to speak to be extracted by force varied in their details the last
however seemed most nearly to approach the truth amongst the objects
picked up by the astrolabe were an anchor weighing about 1800 pounds
a cast-iron cannon a bronze swivel a copper blunderbuss some pig
lead and several other considerably damaged articles of little
interest these relics with those collected by dillon are now in the
naval museum at the louvre

d'urville did not leave vanikoro without erecting a monument to the
memory of his unfortunate fellow-countrymen this humble memorial was
placed in a mangrove grove off the reef itself it consists of a
quadrangular prism made of coral slabs six feet high surmounted by a
pyramid of koudi wood of the same height bearing on a little plate of
lead the following inscription 

  a la mémoire
  de la pérouse
  et de ses compagnons
  l'astrolabe
  14 mars 1828

as soon as this task was accomplished d'urville prepared to set sail
again as it was time he did for the damp resulting from the torrents
of rain had engendered serious fevers prostrating no less than
twenty-five of the party the commander would have to make haste if he
wished to keep a crew fit to execute the arduous manoeuvres necessary
to the exit of the vessel from a narrow pass strewn with rocks

the last day passed by the astrolabe at vanikoro would have shown the
truth to d'urville had he needed any enlightening as to the true
disposition of the natives the following is his account of the last
incidents of this dangerous halt

"at eight o'clock i was a good deal surprised to see half a dozen
canoes approaching from tevaï the more so that two or three natives
from manevaï who were on board showed no uneasiness although they had
told me a few days before that the people of tevaï were their mortal
enemies i expressed my surprise to the manevaians who merely said
with an evident air of equivocation that they had made their peace
with the tevaians who were only bringing some cocoa-nuts i soon saw
however that the new comers were carrying nothing but bows and arrows
in first rate condition two or three of them climbed on board and in
a determined manner came up to the main watch to look down into the
orlop-deck to find out how many men were disabled whilst a malignant
joy lit up their diabolical features at this moment some of the crew
told me that two or three of the manevaï men on board had done the same
thing during the last three or four days and m gressien who had been
watching their movements since the morning thought he had seen the
warriors of the two tribes meet on the beach and have a long conference
together such behaviour gave proof of the most treacherous intentions
and i felt the danger to be imminent i at once ordered the natives to
leave the vessel and return to the canoes but they had the audacity to
look at me with a proud and threatening expression as if to defy me to
put my order into execution i merely had the armoury generally kept
jealously closed opened and with a severe look i pointed to it with
one hand whilst with the other i motioned the savages to the canoes
the sudden apparition of twenty shining muskets the powers of which
they understood made them tremble and relieved us of their ominous
presence"

[illustration "i merely had the armoury opened"]

before leaving the scene of this melancholy story we will glean a few
details from d'urville's account of it the vanikoro mallicolo or as
dillon calls it the la pérouse group consists of two islands
research and tevaï the former is no less than thirty miles in
circumference whilst the latter is only nine miles round both are
lofty clothed with impenetrable forests almost to the beach and
surrounded by a barrier of reefs thirty-six miles in circumference
with here and there a narrow strait between them the inhabitants who
are lazy slovenly stupid fierce cowardly and avaricious do not
exceed twelve or fifteen hundred in number it was unfortunate for la
pérouse to be shipwrecked amongst such people when he would have
received a reception so different on any other island of polynesia the
women are naturally ugly and the hard work they have to do with their
general mode of life render their appearance yet more displeasing the
men are rather less ill-favoured though they are stunted and lean and
covered with ulcers and leprosy scars arrows and bows are their only
weapons and according to themselves the former with their very fine
bone tips soldered on with extremely tenacious gum inflict mortal
wounds they therefore value them greatly and the visitors had great
trouble to obtain any

[illustration reefs off vanikoro]

on the 17th march the astrolabe at length issued from amongst the
terrible reefs encircling vanikoro d'urville had intended to survey
tamnako kennedy nitendi and the solomon islands where he hoped to
meet with traces of the survivors from the shipwreck of the boussole
and the astrolabe but the melancholy condition of the crew pulled
down as they were by fever and the illness of most of the officers
with the absence of any safe anchorage in this part of oceania decided
him to make for guam where he thought a little rest might possibly be
obtained this was a very grave dereliction from the instructions which
ordered him to survey torres straits but the fact of forty sailors
being hors de combat and on the sick-list will suffice to prove how
foolish it would have been to make so perilous an attempt

not until the 26th april was hogoley archipelago sighted where
d'urville bridged over the gaps left by duperrey in his exploration
and only on the 2nd may did the coasts of guam come in sight anchor
was cast at umata where a supply of fresh water was easily found and
the climate much milder than at agagna on the 29th may however when
the expedition set sail again the men were not by any means all
restored to health which d'urville attributed to the excesses in the
way of eating indulged in by the sick and the impossibility of getting
them to keep to a suitable diet

the good medinilla of whom freycinet had such reason to speak
favourably was still governor of guam he did not this time it is
true show so many kind attentions to the present expedition but that
was because a terrible drought had just devastated the colony and a
rumour had got afloat that the illness the crew of the astrolabe was
suffering from was contagious umata too was a good distance from
agagna so that d'urville could not visit the governor in his own home
medinilla however sent the expedition fresh provisions and fruits in
such quantities as to prove he had lost none of his old generosity

after leaving guam d'urville surveyed under sail the elivi the
uluthii of lütke guapgolo and the pelew group of the caroline
archipelago was driven by contrary winds past waigiou aiou asia and
guebek and finally entered bouron straits and cast anchor off amboine
where he was cordially received by the dutch authorities and obtained
news from france to the effect that the minister of marine had taken no
notice of all the work fatigue and perils of the expedition for not
one officer had received advancement

the receipt of this news caused considerable disappointment and
discouragement which the commander at once tried to remove from
amboine the astrolabe steered viâ banka strait for uanado with
its well-armed and equipped fort forming a pleasant residence
governor merkus obtained for d'urville's natural history collections
some fine barberosas a sapioutang the latter a little animal of
the size of a calf with the same kind of muzzle paws and turned-back
horns serpents birds fishes and plants

according to d'urville the people of the celebes resemble in externals
the polynesians rather than the malays they reminded him of the
natives of otaheite tonga tabou and new zealand much more than of
the papuans of darei harbour the harfous of bouron or the malays
with their square bony faces near manado are some mines of auriferous
quartz of which the commander was able to obtain a specimen and in
the interior is the lake of manado said to be of immense depth and
which is the source of the torrent of the same name that dashes in the
form of a magnificent waterfall over a basalt rock eighty feet high
barring its progress to the sea d'urville accompanied by the governor
and the naturalists of the expedition explored this beautiful lake
shut in by volcanic mountains with here and there a few fumerolles
still issuing from them and ascertained the depth of the water to be
no more than twelve or thirteen fathoms so that in the event of its
ever drying up its basin would form a perfectly level plain

on the 4th august anchor was weighed at manado where the sufferers
from fever and dysentery had not got much better and on the 29th of
the same month the expedition arrived at batavia where it only remained
three days the rest of the voyage of the astrolabe was in well-known
waters mauritius was reached in due course and there d'urville met
commander le goarant who had made a trip to vanikoro in the corvette
la bayonnaise and who told d'urville that he had not attempted to
enter the reef but had only sent in some boats to reconnoitre the
natives had respected the monument to the memory of la pérouse and had
been reluctant even to allow the sailors of the bayonnaise to nail a
copper plate upon it

on the 18th november the corvette left mauritius and after touching at
the cape st helena and ascension arrived on the 25th march 1829
at marseilles exactly thirty-five months after her departure from that
port to hydrographical science if to nothing else the results of the
expedition were remarkable and no less than forty-five new charts were
produced by the indefatigable messrs gressien and paris nothing will
better bring before us the richness of harvest of natural history
specimens than the following quotation from cuvier's report 

"they (the species brought home by quoy and gaimard) amount to
thousands in the catalogues and no better proof can be given of the
activity of our naturalists than the fact that the directors of the
jardin du roi do not know where to store the results of the expedition
especially those now under notice they have had to be stowed away on
the ground-floor almost in the cellars and the very warehouses are
now so crowded no other word would do as well that we have had to
divide them by partitions to make more stowage"

the geological collections were no less numerous one hundred and
eighty-seven species or varieties of rock attest the zeal of messrs
quoy and gaimard while m lesson junior collected fifteen or sixteen
hundred plants captain jacquinot made a number of astronomical
observations m lottin studied magnetism and the commander without
neglecting his duties as a sailor and leader of the expedition made
experiments on submarine temperature and meteorology and collected an
immense mass of information on philology and ethnography

we cannot better conclude our account of this expedition than with the
following quotation from dumont d'urville's memoirs given in his
biography by didot 

"this adventurous expedition surpassed all previous ones alike in the
number and gravity of the dangers incurred and the extent of the
results of every kind obtained an iron will prevented me from ever
yielding to any obstacle my mind once made up to die or to succeed i
was free from any hesitation or uncertainty twenty times i saw the
astrolabe on the eve of destruction without once losing hope of her
salvation a thousand times did i risk the very lives of my companions
in order to achieve the object of my instructions and i can assert
that for two consecutive years we daily incurred more real perils than
we should have done in the longest ordinary voyage my brave and
honourable officers were not blind to the dangers to which i daily
exposed them but they kept silence and nobly fulfilled their duty"

from this admirable harmony of purpose and devotion resulted a mass of
discoveries and observations in every branch of human knowledge of all
of which an exact account was given by rossel cuvier geoffrey st
hilaire desfontaines and others all competent and disinterested
judges

we have already had occasion to speak of the antarctic regions and the
explorations made there in the seventeenth and at the end of the
eighteenth century by various navigators nearly all frenchmen
amongst whom we must specially note la roche discoverer of new
georgia in 1675 bouvet kerguelen marion and crozet the name of
antarctic is given to all the islands scattered about the ocean which
are called after navigators as well as those of prince edward the
sandwich group new georgia &c

it was in these latitudes that william smith commander of the brig
william trading between monte video and valparaiso discovered in
1818 the southern shetland islands arid and barren districts covered
with snow on which however collected vast herds of seals animals of
which the skins are used as furs and which had not before been met
with in the southern seas the news of this discovery led to a rush of
whaling-vessels to the new hunting-grounds and between 1821 and 1822
the number of seals captured in this archipelago is estimated at
32000 whilst the quantity of sea-elephant oil obtained during the
same time may be put down at 940 tons as males and females were
indiscriminately slaughtered however the new fields were soon
exhausted the survey of the twelve principal islands and of the
innumerable and all but barren rocks making up this archipelago
occupied but a short time

[illustration hunting sea-elephants]

two years later botwell discovered the southern orkneys and then
palmer and other whalemen sighted or thought they sighted districts
to which they gave the names of palmer and trinity

more important discoveries were however to be made in these
hyberborean regions and the hypothesis of dalrymple buffon and other
scholars of the eighteenth century as to the existence of a southern
continent forming so to speak a counterpoise to the north pole was
to be unexpectedly confirmed by the work of these intrepid explorers

the navy of russia had now for some years been rapidly gaining in
importance and had played no insignificant part in scientific
research we have related the interesting voyages of most russian
circumnavigators but we have still to speak of bellinghausen's voyage
round the world which occupies a prominent place in the history of the
exploration of the antarctic seas

the vostok captain bellinghausen and the mirni commanded by
lieutenant lazarew left cronstadt on the 3rd july 1819 en route
for the antarctic ocean on the 15th december southern georgia was
sighted and seven days later an island was discovered in the
south-east to which the name of traversay was given and the position
of which was fixed at 52 degrees 15 minutes s lat and 27 degrees 21
minutes w long reckoning from the paris meridian

continuing their easterly course in s lat 60 degrees for 400 miles as
far as w long 187 degrees the explorers then bore south to s lat
70 degrees where their further progress was arrested by a barrier of
ice

bellinghausen nothing daunted tried to cut his way eastwards into the
heart of the polar circle but at 44 degrees e long he was compelled
to return northwards after a voyage of forty miles a large country
hove in sight which a whaler was to discover twelve years later when
the ice had broken up

back again in s lat 62 degrees bellinghausen once more steered
eastwards without encountering any obstacles and on the 5th march
1820 he made for port jackson to repair his vessels

the whole summer was given up by the russian navigator to a cruise
about oceania when he discovered no less than seventeen new islands
and on the 31st october he left port jackson on a new expedition the
first places sighted on this trip were the macquarie islands then
cutting across the 60th parallel s lat in e long 160 degrees the
explorers bore east between s lat 64 degrees and 68 degrees as far as
w long 95 degrees on the 9th january bellinghausen reached 70
degrees s lat and the next day discovered in s lat 69 degrees 30
minutes w long 92 degrees 20 minutes an island to which he gave
the name of peter i the most southerly land hitherto visited then
fifteen degrees further east and in all but the same latitude he
sighted some more land which he called alexander i's land scarcely
200 miles distant from graham's land it appeared likely to be
connected with it for the sea between the two districts was constantly
discoloured and many other facts pointed to the same conclusion

from alexander i's land the two vessels bearing due north and
passing graham's land made for new georgia arriving there in
february thence they returned to cronstadt the port of which they
entered in july 1821 exactly two years after they left it having lost
only three men out of a crew of 200

we would gladly have given further details of this interesting
expedition but we have not been able to obtain a sight of the original
account published in russian at st petersburg and we have had to be
content with the résumé brought out in one of the journals of the
geographical society in 1839

[illustration map of the antarctic regions showing the routes taken
by the navigators of the 19th century engraved by e morieu]

at the same period a master in the royal navy james weddell by name
was appointed by an edinburgh firm to the command of an expedition to
obtain seal-skins in the southern seas where two years were to be
spent this expedition consisted of the brig jane 160 tons captain
weddell and the cutter beaufort sixty-five tons matthew brisbane
commander

the two vessels left england on the 17th september 1822 touched at
bonavista one of the cape verd islands and cast anchor in the
following december in the port of st helena on the eastern coast of
patagonia where some valuable observations were taken on the position
of that town

weddell put to sea again on the 27th december and steering in a
south-easterly direction came in sight on the 12th january of an
archipelago to which he gave the name of the southern orkneys these
islands are situated in s lat 60 degrees 45 minutes and w long 45
degrees

according to the navigator this little group presents an even more
forbidding appearance than new shetland on every side rise the sharp
points of rocks bare of vegetation round which surge the restless
waves and against which dash enormous floating icebergs with a noise
like thunder vessels are in perpetual danger in these latitudes and
the eleven days passed under sail by weddell in surveying minutely the
islands islets and rocks of this archipelago were a time of
ceaseless exertion for the crew who were throughout in constant danger
of their lives

specimens of the principal strata of these islands were collected and
on the return home put into the hands of professor jameson of
edinburgh who identified them as belonging to primary and volcanic
rocks

weddell now made for the south crossed the antarctic circle in w
long 30 degrees and soon came in sight of numerous ice islands
beyond s lat 70 degrees these floes decreased in number and finally
disappeared the weather moderated innumerable flocks of birds hovered
above the ships whilst large schools of whales played in its wake
this strange and unexpected change in the temperature surprised every
one especially as it became more marked as the south pole was more
nearly approached everything pointed to the existence of a continent
not far off nothing was however discovered

on the 20th february the vessels were in s lat 74 degrees 15 minutes
and w long 34 degrees 16 minutes 45 seconds

"i would willingly" says weddell "have explored the south-west
quarter but taking into consideration the lateness of the season and
that we had to pass homeward through 1000 miles of sea strewed with ice
islands with long nights and probably attended with fogs i could not
determine otherwise than to take advantage of this favourable wind for
returning"

having seen no sign of land in this direction and a strong southerly
wind blowing at the time weddell retraced his course as far as s lat
58 degrees and steered in an easterly direction to within 100 miles of
the sandwich islands on the 7th february he once more doubled the
southern cape sailed by a sheet of ice fifty miles wide and on the
20th february reached s lat 74 degrees 15 minutes from the top of
the masts nothing was to be seen but an open sea with a few floating
ice-islands

unexpected results had ensued from these trips in a southerly
direction weddell had penetrated 240 miles nearer the pole than any of
his predecessors including cook he gave the name of george iv to
that part of the antarctic ocean which he had explored strange and
significant was the fact that the ice had decreased in quantity as the
south pole was approached whilst fogs and storms were incessant and
the atmosphere was always heavily charged with moisture and the
temperature of surprising mildness

another valuable observation made was that the vibrations of the
compass were as slow in these southern latitudes as parry had noted
them to be in the arctic regions

weddell's two vessels separated in a storm met again in new georgia
after a perilous voyage of 1200 miles amongst the ice new georgia
discovered by la roche in 1675 and visited in 1756 by the lion was
really little known until after captain cook's exploration of it but
his account of the number of seals and walruses frequenting it had led
to being much favoured by whalers chiefly english and american who
took the skins of their victims to china and sold them at a guinea or
thirty shillings each

"the island" says weddell speaking of south georgia "is about
ninety-six miles long and its mean breadth about ten it is so
indented with bays that in several places where they are on opposite
sides they are so deep as to make the distance from one side to the
other very small the tops of the mountains are lofty and perpetually
covered with snow but in the valleys during the summer season
vegetation is rather abundant almost the only natural production of
the soil is a strong-bladed grass the length of which is in general
about two feet it grows in tufts on mounds three or four feet from the
ground no land quadrupeds are found here birds and amphibious animals
are the only inhabitants"

here congregate numerous flocks of penguins which stalk about on the
beach head in air to quote an early navigator sir john nasborough
they look like children in white aprons numerous albatrosses are also
met with here some of them measuring seventeen feet from tip to tip of
their wings when these birds are stripped of their plumage their
weight is reduced one-half

weddell also visited new shetland and ascertained that bridgeman
island in that group is an active volcano he could not land as all
the harbours were blocked up with ice and he was obliged to make for
tierra del fuego

during a stay of two months here weddell collected some valuable
information on the advantages of this coast to navigators and obtained
some accurate data as to the character of the inhabitants in the
interior of tierra del fuego rose a few mountains always covered with
snow the loftiest of which were not more than 3000 feet high weddell
was unable to identify the volcano noticed by other travellers
including basil hall in 1822 but he picked up a good deal of lava
which had probably come from it there was moreover no doubt of its
existence for the explorer under notice had seen on his previous
voyage signs of a volcanic eruption in the extreme redness of the sky
above tierra del fuego

hitherto there had been a good deal of divergence in the opinion of
explorers as to the temperature of tierra del fuego weddell attributes
this to the different seasons of their visits and the variability of
the winds when he was there and the wind was in the south the
thermometer was never more than two or three degrees above zero
whereas when the wind came from the north it was as hot as july in
england according to weddell dogs and otters are the only quadrupeds
of the country

the relations with the natives were cordial throughout the explorer's
stay amongst them at first they gathered about the ship without
venturing to climb on to it and the scenes enacted on the passage of
the first european vessel through the states were repeated in spite of
the long period which had since elapsed of the bread madeira and
beef offered to them the natives would taste nothing but the meat and
of the many objects shown to them they liked pieces of iron and
looking-glasses best amusing themselves with making grimaces in the
latter of such absurdity as to keep the crew in fits of laughter their
general appearance too was very provocative of mirth their jet black
complexions blue feathers and faces streaked with parallel red and
white lines like tick made up a whole of the greatest absurdity and
many were the hearty laughs the english enjoyed at their expense
presently disgusted at receiving nothing more than the iron hoops of
casks from people possessed of such wealth they proceeded to annex all
they could lay hands on these thefts were soon detected and put a stop
to but they gave rise to many an amusing scene and proved the
wonderful imitative powers of the natives

"a sailor had given a fuegan" says weddell "a tin-pot full of coffee
which he drank and was using all his art to steal the pot the sailor
however recollecting after awhile that the pot had not been returned
applied for it but whatever words he made use of were always repeated
in imitation by the fuegan at length he became enraged at hearing his
requests reiterated and placing himself in a threatening attitude in
an angry tone he said 'you copper-coloured rascal where is my
tin-pot?' the fuegan assuming the same attitude with his eyes fixed
on the sailor called out 'you copper-coloured rascal where is my
tin-pot?' the imitation was so perfect that every one laughed except
the sailor who proceeded to search him and under his arm he found the
article missing"

the sterile mountainous districts in this rigorous climate of tierra
del fuego furnish no animal fit for food and without proper clothing
or nourishment the people are reduced to a state of complete barbarism
hunting yields them hardly any game fishing is almost equally
unproductive of results they are obliged to depend upon the storms
which now and then fling some huge cetacean on their shores and upon
such salvage they fall tooth and nail not even taking the trouble to
cook the flesh

in 1828 henry foster commanding the chanticleer received
instructions to make observations on the pendulum with a view to
determining the figure of the earth this expedition extended over
three years and was then ie in 1831 brought to an end by his
violent death by drowning in the river chagres we allude to this trip
because it resulted on the 5th january 1829 in the identification
and exploration of the southern shetlands the commander himself
succeeded in landing though with great difficulty on one of these
islands where he collected some specimens of the syenite of which the
soil is composed and a small quantity of red snow in every respect
similar to that found by explorers in the arctic regions

of far greater interest however was the survey made in 1830 by the
whaler john biscoe the brig tula 140 tons and the cutter lively
left london under his orders on the 14th july 1830 these two vessels
the property of messrs enderby were fitted up for whale-fishing and
were in every respect well qualified for the long and arduous task
before them which according to biscoe's instructions was to combine
discovery in the antarctic seas with whaling

after touching at the falklands the ships started on the 27th november
on a vain search for the aurora islands after which they made for the
sandwich group doubling its most southerly cape on the 1st january
1831

in 59 degrees s lat masses of ice were encountered compelling the
explorers to give up the south-western route in which direction they
had noted signs of the existence of land it was therefore necessary to
bear east skirting along the ice as far as w long 9 degrees 34
minutes it was only on the 16th january that biscoe was able to cross
the 60th parallel of s lat in 1775 cook had here come to a space of
open sea 250 miles in extent yet now an insurmountable barrier of ice
checked biscoe's advance

continuing his south-westerly course as far as 68 degrees 51 minutes
and 10 degrees e long the explorer was struck by the discoloration
of the water the presence of several eaglets and cape-pigeons and the
fact that the wind now blew from the south-south-west all sure tokens
of a large continent being near ice however again barred his
progress southwards and he had to go on in an easterly direction
approaching nearer and nearer to the antarctic circle

"at length on the 27th february" says desborough cooley "in s lat
65 degrees 57 minutes and e long 47 degrees 20 minutes land was
distinctly seen" this land was of considerable extent mountainous and
covered with snow biscoe named it enderby and made the most strenuous
efforts to reach it but it was so completely surrounded with ice that
he could not succeed whilst these attempts were being made a gale of
wind separated the two vessels and drove them in a south-easterly
direction the land remaining in sight and stretching away from east
to west for an extent of more than 200 miles bad weather and the
deplorable state of the health of the crew compelled biscoe to make
for van diemen's land where he was not rejoined by the lively until
some months later

the explorers had several opportunities of observing the aurora
australis to quote from biscoe's narrative or rather the account of
his trip drawn up from his log-book and published in the journal of
the royal geographical society "extraordinarily vivid coruscations of
aurora australis (were seen) at times rolling" says captain biscoe
"as it were over our heads in the form of beautiful columns then as
suddenly changing like the fringe of a curtain and again shooting
across the hemisphere like a serpent frequently appearing not many
yards above our heads and decidedly within our atmosphere"

leaving van diemen's land on the 11th january 1832 biscoe and his two
vessels resumed their voyage in a south-easterly direction the
constant presence of floating sea-weed and the number of birds of a
kind which never venture far from land with the gathering of low and
heavy clouds made biscoe think he was on the eve of some discovery but
storms prevented the completion of his explorations at last on the
12th february in s lat 64 degrees 10 minutes albatrosses penguins
and whales were seen in large quantities and on the 15th land was seen
in the south a long distance off the next day this land was
ascertained to be a large island to which the name of adelaide was
given in honour of the queen of england on this island were a number
of mountains of conical form with the base very large

in the ensuing days it was ascertained that this was no solitary
island but one of a chain of islets forming so to speak the outworks
of a lofty continent this continent stretching away for 250 miles in
an ene and wsw direction was called graham whilst the name of
biscoe was given to the islets in honour of their discoverer there was
no trace either of plants or animals in this country

to make quite sure of the nature of his discovery biscoe landed on the
21st february on graham's land and determined the position of a lofty
mountain to which he gave the name of william in s lat 64 degrees
45 minutes and w long 66 degrees 11 minutes reckoning from the paris
meridian

to quote from the journal of the royal geographical society "the
place was in a deep bay in which the water was so still that could any
seals have been found the vessels could have been easily loaded as
they might have been laid alongside the rocks for the purpose the
depth of the water was also considerable no bottom being found with
twenty fathoms of line almost close to the beach and the sun was so
warm that the snow was melted off all the rocks along the water-line
which made it more extraordinary that they should be so utterly
deserted"

from graham's land biscoe made for the southern shetlands with which
it seemed possible the former might be connected and after touching at
the falkland islands where he lost sight of the lively he returned
to england

as a reward for all he had done and as an encouragement for the
future biscoe received medals both from the english and french
geographical societies

very animated were the discussions which now took place as to the
existence of a southern continent and the possibility of penetrating
beyond the barrier of ice shutting in the adjacent islands three
powers simultaneously resolved to send out an expedition france
entrusted the command of hers to dumont d'urville england chose james
ross and the united states lieutenant charles wilkes

the last named found himself at the head of a small fleet consisting
of the porpoise two sloops the vincennes and the peacock two
schooners the sea-gull and the flying-fish and a transport ship
the relief which was sent on in advance to rio with a reserve of
provisions whilst the others touched at madeira and the cape verd
islands

from the 24th november 1838 to the 6th january 1839 the squadron
remained in the bay of rio de janeiro whence it sailed to the rio
negro not arriving at port orange tierra del fuego until the 19th
february 1839

there the expedition divided the peacock and flying-fish making
for the point were cook crossed s lat 60 degrees and the relief
with the naturalists on board penetrating into the straits of
magellan by one of the passages south-east of tierra del fuego whilst
the vincennes remained at port orange and the sea-gull and
porpoise started on the 24th february for the southern seas wilkes
surveyed palmer's land for a distance of thirty miles to the point
where it turns in a sse direction which he called cape hope he
then visited the shetlands and verified the position of several of the
islands in that group

after passing thirty-six days in these inhospitable regions the two
vessels steered northwards a voyage marked by few incidents worthy of
record brought wilkes to callao but he had lost sight of the
sea-gull the commander now visited the paumatou group otaheite the
society and navigator's islands and cast anchor off sydney on the 28th
november

on the 29th december 1839 the expedition once more put to sea and
steered for the south with a view to reaching the most southerly
latitude between e long 160 degrees and 145 degrees (reckoning from
greenwich) bearing east by west the vessels were at liberty to follow
out separate courses a rendezvous being fixed in case of their losing
sight of each other up to january 22nd numerous signs of land were
seen and some officers even thought they had actually caught sight of
it but it turned out when the various accounts were compared at the
trial wilkes had to undergo on his return that it was merely through
the accidental deviation before the 22nd january of the vincennes in
a northerly direction that the english explorers ascertained the
existence of land not until he reached sydney did wilkes hearing that
d'urville had discovered land on the 19th january pretend to have seen
it on the same day

[illustration dumont d'urville]

these facts are established in a very conclusive article published by
the hydrographer daussy in the bulletin de la société de géographie
further on we shall see that d'urville actually landed on the new
continent so that the honour of being the first to discover it is
undoubtedly his

the peacock and flying-fish either because they had sustained
damages or because of the dangers from the roughness of the sea and
floating ice had steered in a northerly direction from the 24th
january to the 5th february the vincennes and porpoise alone
continued the arduous voyage as far as e long 97 degrees having land
in sight for two or three miles which they approached whenever the ice
allowed them to do so

"on the 29th of january" says wilkes in his report to the national
institution of washington "we entered what i have called piners bay
the only place where we could have landed on the naked rocks we were
driven out of it by one of the sudden gales usual in those seas we got
soundings in thirty fathoms the gale lasted thirty-six hours and
after many narrow escapes i found myself some sixty miles w to
leeward of this bay it now became probable that this land which we had
discovered was of great extent and i deemed it of more importance to
follow its trend than to return to piners bay to land not doubting i
should have an opportunity of landing on some portion of it still more
accessible this however i was disappointed in the icy barrier
preventing our approach and rendering it impossible to effect

"great quantities of ice covered with mud rock and stone presented
themselves at the edge of the barrier in close proximity of the land
from these our specimens were obtained and were quite as numerous as
could have been gathered from the rocks themselves the land covered
with snow was distinctly seen in many places and between them such
appearances as to leave little or no doubt in my mind of it being a
continuous line of coast and deserving the name bestowed upon it of
the antarctic continent lying as it does under that circle many
phenomena were observed here and observations made which will be
found under their appropriate head in the sequel

"on reaching 97 degrees east we found the ice trending to the
northward and continuing to follow it close we reached to within a few
miles of the position where cook was stopped by the barrier in 1773"

piners bay where wilkes landed is situated in e long 140 degrees
(reckoning from paris) that is to say it is identical with the place
visited by d'urville on the 21st january on the 30th january the
porpoise had come in sight of d'urville's two vessels and approached
to within speaking distance of them but they put on all sail and
appeared anxious to avoid any communication

on his arrival at sydney wilkes found the peacock in a state of
repair and with that vessel he visited new zealand tonga tabou and
the fiji islands where two of the junior officers of the expedition
were massacred by the natives the friendly navigator and sandwich
islands admiralty straits puget sound vancouver's island the
ladrones manilla sooloo singapore the sunda islands st helena
and rio de janeiro were the halting places on the return voyage which
terminated on the 9th june 1842 at new york the explorers having
been absent three years and ten months altogether

the results to every branch of science were considerable and the young
republic of the united states was to be congratulated on a début so
triumphant in the career of discovery in spite however of the
interest attaching to the account of this expedition and to the
special treatises by dana gould pickering gray cassin and
brackenbridge we are obliged to refrain from dwelling on the work done
in countries already known the success of these publications beyond
the atlantic was as might be expected in a country boasting of so few
explorers immense

whilst wilkes was engaged in his explorations ie in 1839 balleny
captain of the elizabeth scott was adding his quota to the survey of
the antarctic regions starting from campbell island on the south of
new zealand he arrived on the 7th february in s lat 67 degrees 7
minutes and w long 164 degrees 25 minutes reckoning from the paris
meridian then bearing west and noting many indications of the
neighbourhood of land he discovered two days later a black band in the
south-west which at six o'clock in the evening he ascertained beyond
a doubt to be land this land turned out to be three islands of
considerable size and balleny gave them his own name as may be
imagined the captain tried to land but a barrier of ice prevented his
doing so all he could manage was the determination of the position of
the central isle which he fixed at s lat 66 degrees 44 minutes and
w long 162 degrees 25 minutes

on the 14th february a lofty land covered with snow was sighted in
the wsw the next day there were but ten miles between the vessel and
the land it was approached as nearly as possible and then a boat was
put off but a beach of only three or four feet wide with vertical and
inaccessible cliffs rising beyond it rendered landing impossible and
only by getting wet up to their waists were the sailors able to obtain
a few specimens of the lava characteristic of this volcanic district

[illustration "only by getting wet up to their waists"]

yet once more on the 2nd march in s lat 65 degrees and about w
long 120 degrees 24 minutes land was seen from the deck of the
elizabeth scott the vessel was brought to for the night and the
next day an attempt was made to steer in a south-west direction but it
was impossible to get through the ice barrier naming the new discovery
sabrina balleny resumed his northerly route without being able further
to verify his discoveries

in 1837 just as wilkes had started on his expedition captain dumont
d'urville proposed to the minister of marine a new scheme for a voyage
round the world the services rendered by him in 1819-21 in a
hydrographic expedition in 1822 and 1825 on the coquille under
captain duperrey and lastly in 1826-29 on the astrolabe had given
him an amount of experience which justified him in submitting his
peculiar views to the government and to supplement so to speak the
mass of information collected by himself and others in these little
known latitudes

the minister at once accepted d'urville's offer and exerted himself to
find for him enlightened and trustworthy fellow-workers two corvettes
the astrolabe and the zelée fitted up with everything which french
experience had proved to be necessary were placed at his disposal and
amongst his colleagues were many who were subsequently to rise to the
rank of general officers including jacquinot commander of the
zelée coupvent desbois du bouzet tardy de montravel and perigot
all well-known names to those interested in the history of the french
navy

the instructions given by vice-admiral rosamel to d'urville differed
from those of his predecessors chiefly in his being ordered to
penetrate as near as the ice would permit to the south pole he was
also ordered to complete the great work he had begun in 1827 on the
viti islands to survey the salomon archipelago to visit the swan
river of australia new zealand the chatham islands that part of the
caroline group surveyed by lütke mindanao borneo and batavia whence
he was to return to france viâ the cape of good hope

these instructions concluded in terms proving the exalted ideas of the
government "his majesty" said admiral de rosamel "not only
contemplates the progress of hydrography and natural science but his
royal solicitude for the interests of french commerce and the
development of the french navy is such as to lead him greatly to extend
the terms of your commission and to hope for great results from it you
will visit numerous places the resources of which you must study with
a view to the interests of our whaling-ships collecting all
information likely to be of service to them alike in facilitating their
voyages and rendering those voyages as remunerative as possible you
will touch at those ports where commercial relations with us are
already opened and where the visit of a state vessel will have
salutary effects and at others hitherto closed to our produce and
about which you may on your return give us some valuable details"

in addition to the personal good wishes of louis philippe d'urville
received many marks of the most lively interest taken in his work by
the académie des sciences morales and the geographical society but
not unfortunately from the académie des sciences although he had for
twenty years been working hard to increase the riches of the museum of
natural history

"whether from prejudice or from whatever cause" says d'urville "they
(the members of the académie des sciences) showed very little
enthusiasm for the contemplated expedition and their instructions to me
were as formal as they would have been to a complete stranger"

it is matter of regret that the celebrated arago the declared enemy of
polar researches was one of the bitterest opponents of the new
expedition this was not however the case with various scholars of
other nationalities such as humboldt and kruzenstern who wrote to
congratulate d'urville on his approaching voyage and on the important
results to science which might be hoped for

after numerous delays resulting from the fitting up of two vessels
which were to take the prince de joinville to brazil the astrolabe
and zelée at last left toulon on the 7th september 1837 the last
day of the same month they cast anchor off santa cruz de teneriffe
which d'urville chose as a halting-place in preference to one of the
cape verd islands in the hope of laying in a stock of wine and also of
being able to take some magnetic observations which he had been blamed
for neglecting in 1826 although it was well known that he was not then
in a fit state to attend to such things

in spite of the eagerness of the young officers to go and enjoy
themselves on shore they had to submit to a quarantine of four days on
account of rumours of cases of plague having occurred in the lazaretto
of marseilles without pausing to relate the details of messrs du
bouzet coupvent and dumoulin's ascent of the peak we will merely
quote a few enthusiastic remarks of coupvent desbois 

"arrived" says that officer "at the foot of the peak we spent the
last hour of the ascent in crossing cinders and broken stones arriving
at last at the longed-for goal the loftiest point of this huge
volcano the smoking crater presented the appearance of a hollow
sulphurous semi-circle about 1200 feet wide and 300 feet deep covered
with the débris of pumice and other stones the thermometer which had
marked five degrees at ten am got broken through being placed on the
ground where there was an escape of sulphuric vapour there are upon
the sides and in the crater numerous fumerolles which send forth the
native sulphur which forms the base of the peak the rush of the
vapour is so rapid as to sound like shots from a cannon

"the heat of the ground is so great in some parts that it is impossible
to stand on it for a minute at a time look around you and see if these
three mountains piled one upon the other do not resemble a staircase
built up by giants on which to climb to heaven gaze upon the vast
streams of lava all issuing from one point which form the crater and
which a few centuries back you could not have trodden upon with
impunity see the canaries in the distance look down ye pigmies on
the sea with its breakers dashing against the shores of the island of
which you for the moment form the summit see for once as god sees
and be rewarded for your exertions ye travellers whose enthusiasm for
the grand scenes of nature has brought you some 12182 feet above the
level of the ocean"

we must add that the explorers testified to the brilliancy of the
stars as seen from the summit of the peak the clearness of all
sounds and also to the giddiness and headache known as mountain
sickness whilst part of the staff were engaged in this scientific
excursion several other officers visited the town where they noticed
nothing special except a narrow walk called the alameda and the church
of the franciscans the neighbourhood however is interesting enough
on account of the curious aqueducts for supplying the town with water
and the mercede forest which in d'urville's opinion might more justly
be called a coppice for it contains nothing but shrubs and ferns the
population seemed happy but extremely lazy economical but horribly
dirty and the less said about their morals the better

on the 12th october the two vessels put to sea again intending to
reach the polar regions as soon as possible motives of humanity
however determined d'urville to change his plans and touch at rio the
state of an apprentice with disease of the lungs becoming so rapidly
worse that a stay in the arctic regions would probably have been fatal

the vessels cast anchor in the roadstead not the bay of rio on the
13th november but they only remained there one day that is to say
just long enough to land young dupare and to lay in a stock of
provisions the southerly route was then resumed

for a long time d'urville had wished to explore the strait of magellan
not with a view to further hydrographical surveys for the careful
explorations of captain king begun in 1826 had been finished in 1834
by fitzroy leaving little to be done in that direction but to gather
the rich and still unappropriated harvest of facts relating to natural
history how intensely interesting it was too to note how real had
been the dangers encountered by early navigators such as the sudden
veering of the wind &c what a good thing it would be to obtain
further and more detailed information about the famous patagonians the
subject of so many fables and controversies yet another motive led
d'urville to anchor off port famine rather than off staten island his
perusal of the accounts of the work of explorers who had penetrated
into the southern seas convinced him that the end of january and the
whole of february were the best times for visiting these regions for
then only are the effects of the annual thaw over and with them the
risk of over-fatigue to the crews

[illustration anchorage off port famine]

this resolution once taken d'urville communicated it to captain
jacquinot and set sail for the strait on the 12th december cape
virgin was sighted and dumoulin seconded by the young officers began
a grand series of hydrographical surveys in the intricate navigation
of the strait d'urville we are told showed equal courage and
calmness skill and presence of mind completely winning over to his
side many of the sailors who when they had seen him going along at
toulon when suffering with the gout had exclaimed "oh that old
fellow won't take us far" now when his constant vigilance had brought
the vessels safely out of the strait the cry was "the    man is
mad he's made us scrape against rocks reefs and land as if he had
never taken a voyage before and we used to think him as useless as a
rotten keel"

we must now say a few words on the stay at port famine

landing is easy and there is a good spring and plenty of wood on the
rocks are found quantities of mussels limpets and whelks whilst
inland grows celery and a kind of herb resembling the dandelion
another fruitful source of wealth in this bay is fish and whilst the
vessels were at anchor drag-nets trammels and lines captured enough
mullet gudgeon and roaches to feed the whole crew

"as i was about to re-embark" says d'urville "a little barrel was
brought to me which had been found hung on a tree on the beach near a
post on which was written post office having ascertained that this
barrel contained papers i took it on board and examined them they
consisted of notes of captains who had passed through the straits of
magellan stating the time of their visits the incidents of their
passage with advice to those who should come after them and letters
for europe or the united states it seemed that an american captain
cunningham by name had been the originator of this open-air
post-office he had merely in april 1833 hung a bottle on a tree
and his fellow-countryman waterhouse had supplemented it by the post
with its inscription lastly captain carrick of the schooner mary
ann from liverpool passed through the strait in march 1837 on his
way to san blas california going through it again a second time on
his way back on the 29th november 1837 that is to say sixteen days
before our own visit and he it was who had substituted the barrel for
the bottle adding an invitation to all who should succeed him to use
it as the receptacle of letters for different destinations i mean to
improve this ingenious and useful contrivance by forming an actual
post-office on the highest point of the peninsula with an inscription
in letters of a size so gigantic as to compel the attention of
navigators who would not otherwise have touched at port famine
curiosity will then probably lead them to send a canoe to examine the
box which will be fastened to the post it seems likely that we shall
ourselves reap the first fruits of this arrangement and our families
will be agreeably surprised to receive news from us from this wild and
lonely district just before our plunge into the ice of the polar
regions"

at low tide the mouth of the sedger river which flows into famine bay
is encumbered with sand-banks some 1000 feet further on the plain is
transformed into a vast marsh from which rise the trunks of immense
trees and huge bones bleached by the action of time which have been
brought down by the heavy rainfall swelling the course of the stream

skirting this marsh is a fine forest the entrance to which is
protected by prickly shrubs the commonest trees are the beech with
trunks between eighty and ninety feet high and three or four in
diameter winteria aromatica a kind of bark which has long since
replaced the cinnamon and a species of barbary the largest beeches
seen by d'urville measured fifteen feet in diameter and were about 150
feet high

unfortunately no mammiferous animals or reptiles or fresh or salt
water shell-fish are found on these coasts and one or two different
kinds of birds with a few lichens and mosses were all the naturalist
was able to obtain

several officers went up the sedger in a yawl till they were stopped by
the shallowness of the water they were then seven and a half miles
from the mouth and they noted the width of the river where it flows
into the sea to be between ninety and a hundred feet

"it would be difficult" says m de montravel "to imagine a more
picturesque scene than was spread out before us at every turn
everywhere was that indescribable wildness which cannot be imitated a
confused mass of trees broken branches trunks covered with moss
which seemed literally to grow before our eyes"

to resume the stay at port famine was most successful wood and water
were easily obtained repairs &c were made horary physical
meteorological tidal and hydrographical observations were taken and
lastly numerous objects of natural history were collected the more
interesting as the museums of france hitherto contained nothing
whatever from these unknown regions beyond "a few plants collected by
commerson and preserved in the herbarium of m de jussieu"

on the 28th december 1837 anchor was weighed without a single
patagonian having been seen although the officers and crew had been so
eager to make acquaintance with the natives

the difficulties attending navigation compelled the two corvettes to
cast anchor a little further on off port galant the shores of which
bordered by fine trees are cut by torrents resembling a little
distance off magnificent cascades from fifty to sixty feet high this
compulsory halt was not wasted for a large number of new plants were
collected and the port with the neighbouring bays were surveyed the
commander however finding the season already so far advanced gave up
his idea of going out at the westerly end of the strait and went back
the way he came hoping thus to get an interview with the patagonians
before going to the polar regions

st nicholas bay called by bougainville the baie des français where
the explorers passed new year's day 1838 is a much pleasanter looking
spot than port galant the usual hydrographical surveys were there
brought to a satisfactory issue by the officers under the direction of
dumoulin a boat was despatched to cape remarkable where bougainville
said he had seen fossil shells which however turned out to be
nothing but little pebbles imbedded in a calcareous gangue

interesting experiments were made with the thermometrograph or marine
thermometer at 290 fathoms without reaching the bottom at less than
two miles from land whereas the temperature was nine degrees on the
surface it was but two at the above-named depth and as it is scarcely
likely that currents convey the waters of the two oceans so far down
one is driven to the belief that this is the usual temperature of such
depths

the vessels now made for tierra del fuego where dumoulin resumed his
surveys low exposed and strewn with rocks which serve as landmarks
there were but few dangers to be encountered here magdalena island
gente grande bay elizabeth island and oazy harbour where the camp of
a large party of patagonians was made out with the telescope and
peckett harbour where the astrolabe struck in three fathoms were
successively passed

"as we struck" says d'urville "there were signs of astonishment and
even of excitement amongst the crew and some grumbling was already
audible when in a firm voice i ordered silence and without appearing
at all put out by what had happened i cried 'this is nothing at all
and we shall have plenty more of the same kind of thing' later these
words often recurred to the memory of our sailors it is more difficult
than one would suppose for a captain to maintain perfect calmness and
impassiveness in the midst of the worst dangers even those he has
reason to imagine likely to be fatal"

peckett harbour was alive with patagonians and officers and men were
alike eager to land a crowd of natives on horseback were waiting for
them at the place of disembarkation

gentle and peaceable they readily replied to the questions put to them
and looked quietly at everything shown to them expressing no special
desire for anything offered to them they did not seem either to be at
all addicted to thieving and when on board the french vessels they
made no attempt to carry anything off

their usual height is from four and a half to five feet but some are a
good deal shorter their limbs are large and plump without being
muscular and their extremities are of extraordinary smallness their
most noteworthy characteristic is the breadth of the lower part of the
face as compared to the forehead which is low and retreating long
narrow eyes high cheek-bones and a flat nose give them something of
a resemblance to the mongolian type

they are evidently extremely languid and indolent and wanting in
strength and agility looking at them squatting down standing or
walking with their long hair flowing down their backs one would take
them for the women of a harem rather than savages used to enduring the
inclemency of the weather and to struggle for existence stretched upon
skins with their dogs and horses about them their chief amusement is
to catch the vermin with which they swarm they hate walking so much
that they mount horses just to go down and pick up shells on the beach
a few yards off

a white man was living amongst these patagonians a miserable
decrepit-looking fellow who said he came from the united states but
he spoke english very imperfectly and the explorers took him to be a
german-swiss niederhauser so he called himself had gone to seek his
fortune in the united states and that fortune being long on the road
he had given ear to the wonderful proposals of a certain whaleman who
wanted to complete his crew by this whaleman he was left with seven
others and some provisions on a desert island off tierra del fuego to
hunt seals and dress their skins four months later the schooner
returned laden with skins left the seal-hunters fresh provisions went
off again and never came back whether it had been shipwrecked or
whether the captain had abandoned his sailors it was impossible to
ascertain when the poor fellows found themselves deserted and their
provisions exhausted they embarked in their canoe and rowed up the
straits of magellan soon meeting with some patagonians with whom
niederhauser remained whilst his companions went on well received by
the natives he lived their life with them faring well when food was
plentiful drawing in his belt and living on roots when food was
scarce

weary however of this miserable existence niederhauser entreated
d'urville to take him on board urging that another month of the life
he was leading would kill him the captain consented and received him
as a passenger

during his three months' residence amongst them niederhauser had
learnt something of the language of the patagonians and with his aid
d'urville drew up a comparative vocabulary of a great many words in
patagonian french and german

the war costume of the fuegans includes a helmet of tanned leather
protected by steel-plates and surmounted by a crest of cock's feathers
a tunic of ox-hide dyed red with yellow stripes and a kind of
double-bladed scimitar the chief of peckett harbour allowed his
visitors to take his portrait in full martial costume thereby showing
his superiority to his subjects who would not do the same for fear of
witchcraft

on the 8th january anchor was finally weighed and the second entrance
to the strait was slowly navigated against the tide the straits of
magellan having now been crossed from end to end and a survey made of
the whole of the eastern portion of tierra del fuego thus bridging
over an important gulf in hydrographic knowledge no detailed map of
this coast having previously been made the vessels steered for the
polar regions doubling staten island without difficulty and on the
15th january coming in sight of the first ice an event causing no
little emotion for now was to begin the really hard work of the
voyage

floating ice was not the only danger to be encountered in these
latitudes a dense fog which the keenest sight could not penetrate
soon gathered about the vessels paralyzing their movements and though
they were under a foresail only rendering a collision with the
ice-masses imminent the temperature fell rapidly and the
thermometrograph marked only two degrees on the surface of the sea
whilst the deep water was below zero half-melted snow now began to
fall and everything bore witness that the antarctic regions were
indeed entered

clarence new south orkney islands could not be identified every
one's attention had to be concentrated on avoiding blocks of ice at
midday on the 20th january the vessels were in s lat 62 degrees 3
minutes and w long 49 degrees 56 minutes not far from the place were
powell encountered compact ice-fields and an immense ice-island was
soon sighted some 6000 feet in extent and 300 in height with
perpendicular sides greatly resembling land under certain conditions of
the light numerous whales and penguins were now seen swimming about
the vessels whilst white petrels continually flew across them on the
21st observations gave s lat 62 degrees 53 minutes and d'urville was
expecting soon to reach the 65th parallel when at three am he was
told that further progress was arrested by an iceberg across which it
did not seem possible to cut a passage the vessels were at once put
about and slowly steered in an easterly direction the wind having
fallen

"we were thus enabled" says d'urville "to gaze at our leisure upon
the wonderful spectacle spread out before our eyes severe and grand
beyond expression it not only excited the imagination but filled the
heart with involuntary terror nowhere else is man's powerlessness more
forcibly brought before him a new world displays itself to him but
it is a motionless gloomy and silent world where everything
threatens the annihilation of human faculties should he have the
misfortune to be left here alone no help no consolation no spark of
hope would soothe his last moments one is involuntarily reminded of
the famous inscription on the gate of the inferno of dante 

  "'lasciate ogni speranza voi ch' entrate'"

d'urville now set to work on a very strange task which as compared
with others of a similar kind was likely to be of considerable value
he had an exact measurement taken of the outlines of the iceberg had
other navigators done the same we should have had some precise
information as to the direction taken by icebergs their movements
&c in the southern polar regions a subject still wrapped in the
greatest obscurity

on the 22nd after doubling a point it was ascertained that the
iceberg was bearing ssw by w a lofty and broken piece of land was
sighted in these latitudes dumoulin had begun to survey it and
d'urville was about as he thought to identify it with the new south
greenland of morrell when its outlines became dim and it sunk beneath
the horizon on the 24th the two corvettes crossed a series of floating
islets and entered a plain where the ice was melting the passage
however became narrower and narrower and they were obliged to veer
round to save themselves from being blocked in

everything pointed to the conclusion that the edge of the ice was
melting the ice-islands fell apart with loud reports the ice running
off in little rivulets there was undoubtedly a thaw and fanning had
been right in saying that these latitudes should not be visited before
february

d'urville now decided to steer for the north and try to reach the
islands of new south orkney the map of which had not yet been
accurately laid down the commander was anxious to survey that
archipelago thoroughly and to spend several days there before resuming
his southerly course so as to be in the antarctic regions at the same
time of year as weddell

for three days the explorer coasted along the southern shores of new
south orkney without being able to land he then once more turned
southwards and came in sight of the ice again in s lat 62 degrees 20
minutes and w long 39 degrees 28 minutes

a few minutes before midday a kind of opening was discovered through
which the vessels were forced at all risks this bold manoeuvre was
successful and in spite of the heavy snow the explorers penetrated
into a small basin scarcely two miles in extent and hemmed in on every
side by lofty walls of ice it was decided to make fast to the ice and
when the order to cast anchor was given a young middy on board the
zelée cried naively "is there a port here? i shouldn't have thought
there were people living on the ice"

great indeed was now the joyful enthusiasm on both vessels some of the
young officers of the zelée had come to empty a bowl of punch with
their comrades of the astrolabe and the commander could hear their
shouts of delight from his bed he himself did not however look upon
the situation in quite the same favourable light he felt that he had
done a very imprudent thing shut into a cul-de-sac he could only go
out as he had come and that he could not do until he had the wind
right aft at eleven o'clock d'urville was awoke by a violent shock
accompanied by a noise of breaking as if the vessel had struck on some
rocks he got up and saw that the astrolabe having drifted had
struck violently against the ice where she remained exposed to
collision with the masses of ice which the current was sweeping along
more rapidly than it did the vessel herself

when day dawned the adventurers found themselves surrounded by ice but
in the north a blackish blue line seemed to betray the existence of an
open sea this direction was at once taken but a thick fog immediately
and completely enveloped both ships and when it cleared off they found
themselves face to face with a compact ice barrier beyond which
stretched away as far as the eye could reach an open sea

d'urville now resolved to cut himself a passage and began operations
by dashing the astrolabe with all possible speed against the
obstacle the vessel penetrated two or three lengths into the ice and
then remained motionless the crew climbed out of her on to the ice
armed with pickaxes pincers mattocks and saws and merrily
endeavoured to cut a passage the fragment of ice was already nearly
crossed when the wind changed and the motion of the waves in the
offing began to be felt causing the officers to agree in urging a
retreat into the shelter of the ice-walls for there was some danger if
the wind freshened of the vessel being embayed against the ice and
beaten to pieces by the waves and floating débris

the corvettes had traversed twelve or fifteen miles for nothing when
an officer perched in the shrouds sighted a passage in the ene
that direction was at once taken but again it was found impossible to
cut a passage and when night came the crew had to make the ship fast
to a huge block of ice the loud cracking noises which had awoke the
commander the night before now began with such violence that it really
seemed impossible for the vessel to live till daylight

after an interview with the captain of the zelée however d'urville
made for the north but the day passed without any change being
effected in the position of the vessels and the next day during a
storm of sleet the swell of the sea became so powerful as completely to
raise the ice plain in which they were imprisoned

more careful watch than ever had now to be kept to guard against the
pieces of ice flung long distances by this motion and the rudder had
to be protected from them by a kind of wooden hut

[illustration "the rudder had to be protected"]

with the exception of a few cases of ophthalmia resulting from the
continual glare of the snow the health of the crews was satisfactory
and this was no little satisfaction to the leaders of the expedition
compelled as they were to be continually on the qui-vive not until
the 9th february were the vessels favoured by a strong breeze able to
get off and once more enter a really open sea the ice had been
coasted for a distance of 225 leagues the vessels had actually
sustained no further damage than the loss of a few spars and a
considerable portion of the copper sheathing involving no further
leakage than there had been before

the next day the sun came out and observations could be taken giving
the latitude as 62 degrees 9 minutes s and the longitude 39 degrees
22 minutes w

snow continued to fall the cold was intense and the wind very violent
for the three succeeding days this continuance of bad weather
together with the increasing length of the nights warned d'urville of
the necessity of giving up all idea of going further when therefore
he found himself in s lat 62 degrees and w long 33 degrees 11
minutes in other words in that part of the ocean where weddell had
been able to sail freely in 1823 and the new explorer had met with
nothing but impassable ice he steered for new south orkney a whole
month passed amongst the ice and fogs of the antarctic ocean had told
upon the health of the crews and nothing could be gained for science
by a continuance of the cruise

on the 20th the archipelago was again sighted and d'urville was once
more driven out of his course in a northerly direction by the ice but
he was able to put off with two boats the crews of which collected on
weddell island a large number of geological specimens lichens &c
and some twenty penguins and chionis

on the 25th february clarence island was seen forming the eastern
extremity of the new south shetland archipelago a very steep and
rugged district covered with snow except on the beach and thence the
explorers steered towards elephant island resembling clarence island
in every respect except that it is strewn with peaks rising up black
against the plains of snow and ice the islets of narrow biggs
o'brien and aspland were successively identified but covered as they
are with snow they are perfectly inaccessible to man the little
volcano of bridgeman was also seen and the naturalists tried in vain
to land upon it from two boats

"the general colour of the soil" says the narrative "is red like
that of burnt brick with particles of grey suggestive of the presence
of pumice-stone or of calcined cinders here and there on the beach
are seen great blackish-looking blocks which are probably lava this
islet has however only one true crater although thick columns of
smoke are emitted from it nearly all of them issuing from the base on
the western side whilst in the north are two other fumerolles thirty
or forty feet along the water there are none on the eastern or
northern side or at the top which is smooth and round the bulk
appears recently to have undergone some considerable modification as
indeed it must have done or it could not now resemble so little the
description given by powell in december 1822"

d'urville soon resumed his southerly route and on the 27th february
sighted a considerable belt of land in the south-east on which he was
prevented from landing by the fog and the continuous fall of very fine
snow he was now in the latitude of hope island ie in s lat 62
degrees 57 minutes he approached it very closely and sighted before
reaching it a low-lying land to which he gave the name of joinville
then further on in the south-west he came to an extensive district
which he named louis philippe and between the two in a kind of
channel encumbered with ice an island he called rosamel

"now" says d'urville "the horizon was so light that we could trace
all the irregularities of louis philippe's land we could see it
stretching away from mount bransfield in the north (62 degrees w
long) to the ssw where it faded away on the horizon from mount
bransfield to the south it is lofty and of fairly uniform surface
resembling a vast unbroken ice-field in the south however it rises
in the form of a fine peak (mount jacquinot) which is equal perhaps
indeed superior to bransfield but beyond this peak it stretches away
in the form of a mountain chain ending in the south-west in a peak
loftier than any of the others for the rest the effect of the snow
and ice together with the absence of any objects with which they can
be compared aid in exaggerating the height of all irregularities and
as a matter of fact the results of the measurements taken by m
dumoulin showed all these mountains which then appeared to us gigantic
and equal to the alps and pyrenees at least to be after all of very
medium size mount bransfield for instance was not more than about
2068 feet high mount jacquinot 2121 feet and mount d'urville the
loftiest of them all about 3047 feet except for the islets grouped
about the mainland and a few peaks rising above the snow the whole
country is one long series of compact blocks of ice and it is
impossible to do more than trace the outlines of this ice-crust those
of the land itself being quite indistinguishable"

on the 1st march soundings gave only eighty fathoms with a bottom of
rock and gravel the temperature is 1 degree 9 on the surface and 0
degree 2 at the bottom of the sea on the 2nd of march off louis
philippe's land an island was sighted which was named astrolabe and
the day after a large bay or rather strait to which the name of
orleans channel was given was surveyed between louis philippe's land
and a lofty rocky belt which d'urville took for the beginning of
trinity land hitherto very inaccurately laid down

from the 26th february then to the 5th march d'urville remained in
sight of the coast skirting along it a little distance off but unable
entirely to regulate his course on account of the incessant fogs and
rain everything bore witness to the setting in of a very decided thaw
the temperature rising at midday to five degrees above zero whilst the
ice was everywhere melting and running off in little streams of water
or falling with a formidable crush into the sea in the form of blocks
the wind meanwhile blowing strongly from the west

all this decided d'urville against the further prosecution of this
voyage the sea was heavy the rain and fog incessant it was therefore
necessary to leave this dangerous coast and make for the north where
on the following day he surveyed the most westerly islands of the new
shetland group

d'urville next steered for conception and very arduous was the voyage
there for in spite of every precaution the crews of both corvettes
especially that of the zelée were attacked with scurvy it was now
that d'urville measured the heights of some of the waves with a view
to the disproving of the charge of exaggeration which had been brought
against him when he had estimated those he had seen break over needle
bank at a height of between eighty and a hundred feet

with the help of some of his officers that there might be no doubt as
to his accuracy d'urville measured some waves of which the vertical
height was thirty-five feet and which measured not less than 196-1/2
feet from the crest to the lowest point making a total length of 393
feet for a single wave these measurements were an answer to the
ironical assertion of arago who settling the matter in his own study
would not allow that a wave could exceed from five to six feet in
height one need not hesitate a single moment to accept as against the
eminent but impulsive physicist the measurements of the navigators who
had made observations upon the spot

on the 7th april 1838 the expedition cast anchor in talcahuano bay
where the rest so sorely needed by the forty scrofulous patients of the
zelée was obtained thence d'urville made for valparaiso after
which having entirely crossed oceania he cast anchor on the 1st
january 1839 off guam arrived at batina in october and went thence
to hobart's town whence on the 1st january 1840 he started on a new
trip in the antarctic regions

at this time d'urville knew nothing either of balleny's voyage or of
the discovery of sabrina's land he merely intended to go round the
southern extremity of tasmania with a view to ascertaining beneath
which parallel he would meet with ice he was under the impression that
the space between 120 degrees and 160 degrees e long had not yet been
explored so that there was still a discovery to be made

at first navigation was beset with the greatest difficulties the swell
was very strong the currents bore in an easterly direction the
sanitary condition of the crews was far from satisfactory and 58
degrees s lat had not yet been reached when the presence of ice was
ascertained

the cold soon became very intense the wind veered round to the wnw
and the sea became calm a sure indication of the neighbourhood of land
or of ice the former was the more generally received hypothesis for
the ice-islands passed were too large to have been formed in the open
ocean on the 18th january s lat 64 degrees was reached and great
perpendicular blocks of ice were met with the height of which varied
from ninety to 100 feet whilst the breadth exceeded 3000

the next day january 19th 1840 a new land was sighted to which the
name of adélie was given the sun was now burning hot and the ice all
seemed to be melting immense streams running down from the summits of
the rocks into the sea the appearance of the land was monotonous
covered as it was with snow it ran from west to east and seemed to
slope gradually down to the sea on the 21st the wind allowed the
vessels to approach the beach and deep ravines were soon made out
evidently the result of the action of melted snow

[illustration view of adélie land (fac-simile of early engraving)]

[illustration reduced map of d'urville's discoveries in the antarctic
regions]

as the ships advanced navigation became more and more perilous for the
ice-islands were so numerous that there was hardly a large enough
channel between them for any manoeuvring

"their straight walls" says d'urville "rose far above our masts
glowering down upon our vessels which appeared of absurdly small
dimensions as compared with their huge masses the spectacle spread
out before us was alike grand and terrible one might have fancied
oneself in the narrow streets of a city of giants"

[illustration "their straight walls rose far above our masts"]

the corvettes soon entered a huge basin formed by the coast and the
ice-islands which had just been passed the land stretched away in the
south-east and north-west as far as the eye could reach it was between
three and four thousand feet high but nowhere presented any very
salient features in the centre of the vast snow plain rose a few
rocks the two captains at once sent off boats with orders to bring
back specimens which should testify to the discovery made we quote
from the account of du bouzet one of the officers told off on this
important survey

"it was nearly nine o'clock when to our great delight we landed on the
western side of the most westerly and loftiest islet the astrolabe
boat had arrived one moment before ours and its crew were already
clambering up the steep sides of the rock flinging down the penguins
as they went the birds showing no small surprise at being thus
summarily dispossessed of the island of which they had been hitherto
the only inhabitants i at once sent one of our sailors to unfurl a
tricolour flag on these territories which no human creature had seen
or trod before ourselves according to the old custom to which the
english have clung tenaciously we took possession of them in the name
of france together with the neighbouring coast which we were
prevented from visiting by the ice the only representatives of the
animal kingdom were the penguins for in spite of all our researches we
did not find a single shell the rocks were quite bare without so much
as the slightest sign of a lichen we had to fall back on the mineral
kingdom we each took a hammer and began chipping at the rock but it
being of granite was so extremely hard that we could only obtain very
small bits fortunately in climbing to the summit of the island the
sailors found some big pieces of rock broken off by the frost and
these they embarked in their boats looking closely at them i noticed
an exact resemblance between these rocks and the little bits of gneiss
which we had found in the stomach of a penguin we had killed the day
before the little islet on which we landed is part of a group of eight
or ten of similar character and form they are between five hundred and
six hundred yards from the nearest coast we also noticed on the beach
several peaks and a cape quite free from snow these islets close as
they are to each other seem to form a continuous chain parallel with
the coast and stretching away from east to west"

on the 22nd and 23rd the survey of this coast was continued but on the
second day an iceberg soldered to the coast compelled the vessels to
turn back towards the north whilst at the same time a sudden and
violent snow-storm overtook and separated them the zelée especially
sustained considerable damage but was able to rejoin her consort the
next day

throughout it all however sight of the land had not so to speak
been lost but on the 29th the wind blew so strongly and persistently
from the east that d'urville had to abandon the survey of adélie land
it was on this same day that he sighted the vessels of lieutenant
wilkes d'urville complains of the discourtesy of the latter and says
that his own manoeuvres intended to open communications with them had
been misunderstood by the americans

"we are no longer" he says "in the days when navigators in the
interests of commerce thought it necessary carefully to conceal their
route and their discoveries to avoid the competition of rival nations
i should on the contrary have been glad to point out to our emulators
the result of our researches in the hope that such information might
be of use to them and increase our geographical knowledge"

on the 30th january a huge wall of ice was sighted as to the nature of
which opinions were divided some said it was a compact and isolated
mass others and this was d'urville's opinion thought these lofty
mountains had a base of earth or of rocks or that they might even be
the bulwarks of a huge extent of land which they called clarie it is
situated in 128 degrees e long

the officers had collected sufficient information in these latitudes to
determine the position of the southern magnetic pole but the results
obtained by them did not accord with those given by duperrey wilkes
and ross

on the 17th february the two corvettes once more cast anchor off
hobart's town and on the 25th set sail again for new zealand where
they completed the hydrographical surveys of the uranie they then
made for new guinea ascertained that it was not separated by a strait
from the louisiade archipelago surveyed torres strait with the
greatest care in spite of dangers from currents coral reefs &c
arrived at timor on the 20th and returned to toulon on the 8th
november after touching at bourbon and st helena

when the news of the grand discoveries made by the united states
reached england a spirit of emulation was aroused and the learned
societies decided on sending an expedition to the regions in which
weddell and biscoe had been the only explorers since the time of cook

captain james clark ross who was appointed to the command of this
expedition was the nephew of the famous john ross explorer of
baffin's bay born in 1800 james ross was a sailor from the age of
twelve he accompanied his uncle in 1818 in his first arctic
expedition had taken part under parry in four expeditions to the same
latitudes and from 1829-1833 he had been his uncle's constant and
faithful companion entrusted with the taking of scientific
observations he had discovered the north magnetic pole and he had
also made a good many excursions across the ice on foot and in sledges
he was therefore now one of the most experienced of british naval
officers in polar expeditions

[illustration captain john ross]

two vessels the erebus and the terror were entrusted to him and
his second in command was an accomplished sailor captain francis
rowdon crozier companion of parry in 1824 of ross in 1835 in baffin's
bay and the future companion of franklin in the terror in his
search for the north-west passage it would have been impossible to
find a braver or more experienced sailor

the instructions given to james ross by the admiralty differed
essentially from those received by wilkes and dumont d'urville for the
latter the exploration of the antarctic regions was but one incident of
their voyage round the world whereas it was the very raison d'être
of ross's journey of the three years he would be away from europe the
greater part was to be spent in the antarctic regions and he would
only leave the ice to repair the damages to his vessels or recruit the
health of his crew worn out as they would probably be by fatigue and
sickness

the vessels had been equally judiciously chosen stronger than those of
d'urville they were better fitted to resist the repeated assaults of
the ice and their seasoned crews had been chosen from sailors familiar
with polar navigation

the erebus and terror under the command of ross and crozier left
england on the 29th september 1839 and touched successively at
madeira the cape verd islands st helena and the cape of good hope
where numerous magnetic observations were taken

on the 12th april ross reached kerguelen's island and there landed his
instruments the scientific harvest was abundant some fossil trees
were extracted from the lava of which this island is formed and some
rich layers of coal were discovered which have not yet been worked
the 29th was fixed for simultaneous magnetic observations in different
parts of the globe and by a singular coincidence some magnetic storms
such as had already visited europe were on this very day observed in
these latitudes the instrument registered the same phenomena as at
toronto canada proving the vast extent of these meteoric
disturbances and the incredible rapidity with which they spread

on his arrival at hobart town where his old friend john franklin was
now governor ross heard of the discovery of adélie and of clarie lands
by the french and the simultaneous survey of them by wilkes who had
even left a sketch of his map of the coasts

ross however decided to make for e long 170 degrees because it was
in that direction that balleny had found an open sea extending to s
lat 69 degrees he duly reached first the auckland and then the
campbell islands and after having like his predecessors tacked about
a great deal in a sea strewn with ice-islands he came beyond the
sixty-third degree to the edge of the stationary ice and on the 1st
january 1841 crossed the antarctic circle

the floating ice did not in any respect resemble that of the arctic
regions as james ross very soon discovered it consisted of huge
blocks with regular and vertical walls whilst the ice-fields less
compact than those of the north move about in chaotic confusion
looking to quote wilkes' imaginative simile like a heaving land as
they alternately break away from each other and reunite

to ross the ice barrier did not present so formidable an appearance as
it had done to the french and americans he did not at first venture
upon it however being kept in the offing by storms not until the 5th
january was he able to penetrate to s lat 66 degrees 45 minutes and
e long 174 degrees 16 minutes circumstances could not have been more
favourable for the sea and wind were both acting upon and loosening
the ice and thanks to the strength of his vessels ross was able to
cut a passage as he advanced further and further southward the fog
became denser and the constant snow-storms added to the already serious
dangers of navigation encouraged however by the reflection in the
sky of an open sea a phenomenon which turned out to be trustworthy he
pushed on and on the 9th january after crossing 200 miles of ice he
actually entered that open sea

on the 11th january land was sighted 100 miles ahead in s lat 70
degrees 47 minutes and e long 172 degrees 36 minutes this the most
southern land ever yet discovered consisted of snow-clad peaks with
glaciers sloping down to the sea the peaks rising to a height of from
nine to twelve thousand feet this estimate judging from d'urville's
remarks on graham's land may however possibly be an exaggerated one
here there and everywhere black rocks rose up from the snow but the
coast was so shut in with ice that landing was impossible this curious
series of huge peaks received the name of admiralty chain and the
country itself that of victoria

[illustration map of victoria discovered by james ross engraved by
e morieu]

a few little islands were made out in the south-east before the vessels
left this coast and on the 12th january the two captains with some of
their officers disembarked on one of the volcanic islets and took
possession of it in the name of england not the slightest trace of
vegetation was found upon it

ross soon ascertained that the eastern side of this vast land sloped
towards the south whilst the northern stretched away to the
north-west he therefore skirted along the eastern beach forcing a
passage in a southerly direction beyond the magnetic pole which he
places near s lat 76 degrees and then returning by the west thus
entirely circumnavigating his new discovery which he looked upon as a
very large island the mountain chain extends all along the coast ross
gave to the principal peaks the names of herschell whewell
wheatstone murchison and melbourne he was unable however on
account of the ever-increasing quantity of ice about the coast to make
out the details of its outlines on the 23rd january the seventy-fourth
degree the most southerly latitude ever reached was passed

the vessels were now considerably hampered by fogs southerly gales
and violent snow-storms but they managed to continue their cruise
along the coast and on the 27th january the english disembarked on a
little volcanic island in s lat 76 degrees 8 minutes and e long 168
degrees 12 minutes to which they gave the name of franklin

the next day a huge mountain was seen which rose abruptly to a height
of 12000 feet above a far-stretching land the summit of regular
form and completely covered with snow was every now and then wrapped
in a thick cloud of smoke no less than 300 feet in diameter taking
this diameter as a standard of measure the height of the cloud in
shape like an inverted cone would be about one-half of it when this
cloud of smoke dispersed a bare crater was discovered lit up by a
bright red glow visible even in broad daylight the sides of the
mountain were covered with snow up to the very crater and it was
impossible to make out any signs of a flow of lava

a volcano is always a magnificent spectacle and the sight of this one
rising up from amongst the antarctic ice and excelling etna and
teneriffe in its marvellous activity could not fail to make a vivid
impression upon the minds of the explorers the name of erebus was
given to it and that of terror to an extinct crater on the east of it
both titles being admirably appropriate

the two vessels continued their cruise along the northern coast of
victoria until their further passage was barred by a huge mass of ice
towering 505 feet above their masts behind this barrier rose another
mountain chain which sunk out of sight in the sse and to which the
name of parry was given ross skirted along the ice barrier in an
easterly direction until the 2nd february when he reached s lat 78
degrees 4 minutes the most southerly point attained on this trip
during which he had followed the shores of the land he had discovered
for more than 300 miles he left it in e long 191 degrees 23 minutes

but for the strong favourable winds which now blew it seems probable
that the vessels would never have issued in safety from amongst the
formidable ice masses through which they finally worked their way at
the cost of incredible exertions and fatigues and in face of incessant
danger

on the 15th february yet another attempt was made in s lat 76 degrees
to reach the magnetic pole but further progress was barred by land in
s lat 76 degrees 12 minutes and e long 164 degrees ie sixty-five
ordinary miles from the position assigned to it (the magnetic pole) by
ross and the appearance of this land was forbidding and the sea so
rough that the explorer gave up all idea of continuing his researches
on shore

after identifying the islands discovered in 1839 by balleny ross found
himself on the 6th march amongst the mountains alluded to by wilkes

"on the 4th march" says ross's narrative "they recrossed the
antarctic circle and being necessarily close by the eastern extreme of
those patches of land which lieut wilkes has called 'the antarctic
continent' and having reached the latitude on the 5th they steered
directly for them and at noon on the 6th the ship being exactly over
the centre of this mountain range they could obtain no soundings with
600 fathoms of line and having traversed a space of eighty miles in
every direction from this spot during beautiful clear weather which
extended their vision widely around were obliged to confess that this
position at least of the pseudo-antarctic continent and the nearly
200 miles of barrier represented to extend from it have no real
existence"[1]

[footnote 1 the editor of the literary gazette adds the following
note "lieutenant wilkes may have mistaken some clouds or fog-banks
which in these regions are very likely to assume the appearance of land
to inexperienced eyes for this continent and range of lofty mountains
if so the error is to be regretted as it must tend to throw discredit
on other portions of his discoveries which have a more substantial
foundation" trans]

the expedition got back to tasmania without having a single case of
sickness on board or sustaining the slightest damage the vessels were
here refitted and the instruments regulated before starting on a
second trip on which sydney and island's bay new zealand and
chatham were the first stations touched at by ross to make magnetic
observations on the 18th december in s lat 62 degrees 40 minutes
and e long 146 degrees ice was encountered 300 miles further north
than in the preceding year the vessels had arrived too early but
ross nevertheless endeavoured to break through this formidable
barrier after penetrating for 300 miles he was stopped by masses so
compact that it was impossible to go further and he did not cross the
antarctic circle until the 1st january 1842 on the 19th of the same
month the two vessels encountered the most violent storm just as they
were entering an open sea the erebus and terror lost their helms
floating ice washed over them and for twenty-six hours they were in
danger of going down

the detention of the expedition amongst the ice lasted no less than
forty-six days and not until the 22nd did ross reach the great barrier
of stationary ice which was considerably lower beyond erebus where it
was no less than 200 feet high when ross came to it this year it was
only 107 feet high and it was 150 miles further east than it had been
on the previous expedition the acquisition of this piece of
geographical information was the only result of this arduous campaign
extending over 136 days and greatly excelling in dramatic interest the
preceding expedition

the vessels now made for cape horn and sailed up the coast as far as
rio de janeiro where they found everything of which they stood in
need as soon as they had laid in a stock of provisions they again put
to sea and reached the falkland islands whence on the 17th december
1842 they started on their third trip

the first ice was this time met with near clarence island and on the
25th december ross found his further progress barred by it he then
made for the new shetland islands completed the survey of louis
philippe and joinville lands discovered by dumont d'urville named
mts haddington and parry ascertained that louis philippe's land is
only a large island and visited bransfield strait separating it from
shetland such were the marvellous results obtained by james ross in
his three expeditions

to assign to the three explorers whose work in the antarctic regions
we have been reviewing his just meed of praise we may say that
d'urville first discovered the antarctic continent wilkes traced its
shores for a considerable distance for we cannot fail to recognize the
resemblance between his map and that of the french navigator and that
james ross visited the most southerly and most interesting part

but is there such a continent after all? d'urville was not quite sure
about it and ross did not believe in it we must leave the decision of
this great question to the later explorers who were to follow in the
footsteps of the intrepid sailors whose voyages and discoveries we have
related

dease and simpson's expedition


we have more than once alluded to the great impulse given to
geographical science by peter i one of the earliest results of this
impulse was the discovery by behring of the straits separating asia
from america and the most important was the survey thirty years later
of the liakhov archipelago or new siberia

in 1770 a merchant named liakhov noticed a large herd of reindeer
coming across the ice from the north and he reflected that they could
only have come from a country where there were pastures enough to
support them a month later he started in a sledge and after a journey
of fifty miles he discovered between the mouths of the lena and
indighirka three large islands the vast deposits of fossil ivory on
which have since become celebrated all over the world

in 1809 hedenstroem received instructions to make a map of this new
discovery he made several attempts to cross the frozen ocean on a
sledge but was always turned back by ice which would not bear him he
came to the conclusion that there must be an open sea beyond and he
founded this opinion on the immense quantity of warm water which flows
into the arctic ocean from the great rivers of asia

in march 1821 lieutenant (afterwards admiral) anjou crossed the ice
to within forty-two miles of the north of the island of kotelnoï and
in n lat 76 degrees 38 minutes saw a vapour which led him to believe
in the existence of an open sea in a second trip he actually saw this
sea with its drifting ice and came back convinced of the impossibility
of going further in a sledge on account of the thinness of the ice

whilst anjou was thus employed another naval officer lieutenant
wrangell collected some important traditions about the existence of
land the other side of cape yakan

from a tchouktchi chief he learnt that in fine weather though never in
the winter from the coast and some reefs at the mouth of a river
mountains covered with snow could be seen far away in the north and
that in former days when the sea was frozen over reindeer used to come
from there the chief had himself once seen a herd of reindeer on their
way back to the north by this route and he had followed them in a
sledge for a whole day until the state of the ice compelled him to give
up the experiment

his father had told him too that a tchouktchi had once gone there
with a few companions in a skin boat but he did not know what they had
discovered or what had become of them he was sure that the land in the
north was inhabited because a dead whale had once been washed on to
aratane island with spears tipped with slate in its flesh and the
tchouktchis never used such weapons

these facts were very curious and they increased wrangell's desire to
penetrate to the unknown northern districts but the truth of all the
rumours was not verified until our own day

between 1820 and 1824 wrangell made four expeditions in sledges from
the mouth of the kolyma which he made his headquarters first
exploring the coast to cape tchelagskoi and enduring thirty-five
degrees of cold and in his second trip trying how far he could go
across the ice an experiment resulting in a journey of 400 miles from
the land in the third year (1822) wrangell started in march with a
view to verifying the report of a native who said he had seen land in
the offing he now came to an icefield on which he advanced safely for
a long distance when it began to be less compact and was soon not
solid enough to bear many sledges so two small ones were selected on
which were packed a wherry some planks and some tools the explorer
then ventured on some melting ice which broke under his feet

[illustration "two small sledges were selected"]

"at the outset" says wrangell "i had to make way for seven wersts
across a bed of brine further on appeared a surface furrowed with
great crevasses which we could only succeed in clearing by the help
of our planks i noticed in this part several small mounds of ice in
such a liquefying condition that the slightest touch would suffice to
break it and convert the mound into a round slough the ice upon which
we were travelling was without consistency was but a foot in
thickness and what was more was riddled with holes i could only
compare the appearance of the sea at this stage to an immense morass
and indeed the muddy water which issued from these thousands of
crevasses opening up in every direction the melting snow mixed with
earth and sand those little mounds whence numerous streamlets were
issuing all these combined to make the illusion perfect"

wrangell had advanced some 140 miles and it was the open sea or the
polynia as he calls vast expanses of water north of siberia the
outskirts of which he had reached the same in fact as that already
sighted by leontjew in 1764 and hedenstroem in 1810

on his fourth voyage wrangell and his small party of followers started
from cape yakan the nearest point to the arctic regions and after
passing cape tchelagskoi made for the north but a violent storm broke
up the ice there only three feet thick and involved the explorers in
the greatest danger now dragged across some large unbroken slab now
wet to the waist on a moving plank sometimes above and sometimes under
water or moored to a block serving as a ferryboat which the swimming
dogs dragged along they at last succeeded in crossing the shifting
reverberating ice and regaining the land owing their life to the
strength and agility of their teams of dogs alone thus closed the last
attempt made to reach the districts north of siberia

the arctic calotte[1] was meanwhile being attacked from the other side
with equal energy and yet more perseverance it will be remembered with
what untiring enthusiasm the famous north-west passage had been sought
no sooner had the peace of 1815 necessitated the disarmament of
numerous english vessels and set free their officers on half-pay than
the admiralty unwilling to let experienced seamen rust in idleness
sought for them some employment it was under these circumstances that
the search for the north-west passage was resumed

[footnote 1 the word calotte here used by verne is untranslateable
it signifies literally a particular kind of cap frequently a monk's
cap or cowl trans]

the alexander 252 tons and the isabel 385 under command of the
experienced officers john ross and lieutenant parry with james ross
back and belcher who were to win honour in arctic explorations
amongst their subordinates were sent by the government to explore
baffin's bay and set sail on the 18th april after touching at the
shetland islands and seeking in vain for the submerged land seen by
bass in n lat 57 degrees 28 minutes the explorers came on the 26th
may to the first ice and on the 2nd june surveyed the western coast of
greenland hitherto very imperfectly laid down in maps finding it
greatly encumbered by ice indeed the governor of the dutch settlement
of whale island told them that the severity of the winter months had
been steadily increasing during the eleven years of his residence in
the country

hitherto it had been supposed that the country was uninhabited beyond
75 degrees n lat and the travellers were therefore greatly surprised
to see a whole tribe of esquimaux arrive by way of the ice they knew
nothing of any race but their own and stared at the english without
daring to touch them one of them even addressing to the vessels in a
grave and solemn voice the inquiries who are you? whence do you come?
from the sun or from the moon?

[illustration esquimaux family (fac-simile of early engraving)]

although in many respects far inferior to the esquimaux who had become
to some extent civilized by long intercourse with europeans the
new-comers understood the use of iron of which a few of them had even
succeeded in making knives this iron as far as the english could
gather was dug out of a mountain it was probably of meteoric origin

as public opinion in england subsequently confirmed ross in spite of
qualities as a naval officer of the highest order showed extraordinary
apathy and levity on this voyage appearing not to trouble himself in
the least about the geographical problems for the solution of which the
expedition was organized he passed wolstenholme and whale sounds and
smith's strait opening out of baffin's bay without examining them
the last named at so great a distance that he did not even recognize
it still worse than that was his conduct later cruising down the
western shores of baffin's bay a long deep gulf no less than fifty
miles across gradually came in sight of the eager explorers yet when
on the 29th august the two vessels had sailed up it for thirty miles
only ross gave orders to tack about on the ground that he distinctly
saw at the further end a chain of lofty mountains to which he gave the
name of croker his officers did not share his opinion they could not
see so much as the slightest sign of a hill for the very excellent
reason that the gulf they had entered was really lancaster sound so
named by baffin and connecting his bay with the western arctic ocean

the same sort of thing occurred again and again in the voyage along
this deeply indented coast the vessels keeping so far off shore that
not a detail could be made out thus it came about that cumberland bay
was passed on the 1st october without any survey of that most important
feature of davis strait and ross returned to england having literally
turned his back on the glory awaiting him

when accused of apathy and neglect of duty ross replied with supreme
indifference "i trust as i believe myself that the objects of the
voyage have been in every important point accomplished that i have
proved the existence of a bay from disco to cumberland strait and set
at rest for ever the question of a north-west passage in this
direction"

it would have been impossible to make a more complete mistake but
fortunately the failure of this expedition did not in the least
discourage other explorers some saw in it a brilliant confirmation of
the venerable baffin's discovery others looked upon the innumerable
inlets with their deep waters and strong currents as something more
than mere bays they were straits and all hope of the discovery of the
north-west passage was not yet lost

[illustration map of the arctic regions engraved by e morieu]

these suggestions so far weighed with the english admiralty as to lead
to the equipment of two small vessels the bomb-vessel hecla and the
brigantine griper which left the thames on the 5th may 1819 under
command of lieutenant william parry whose opinion as to the existence
of the north-west passage had not coincided with that of his chief the
vessels reached lancaster sound without meeting with any special
adventures and after a delay of seven days amongst the ice which
encumbered the sea for a distance of eighty miles they entered the
supposed bay "shut in by a mountain chain" of john ross to find not
only that this mountain chain did not exist but that the bay was a
strait more than 310 fathoms deep where the influence of the tide
could be felt the temperature of the water rose some ten degrees and
in the course of a single day no less than eighty full-grown whales
were seen

on the 31st july the explorers landed on the shores of possession bay
visited by them the previous year and found there their own
footprints a sign of the small quantity of snow and hoar frost which
had fallen during the winter all hearts beat high when with a
favourable wind and all sails set the two vessels entered lancaster
sound

"it is more easy" says parry "to imagine than to describe the almost
breathless anxiety which was now visible in every countenance while
as the breeze continued to a fresh gale we ran quickly up the sound
the mast-heads were crowded by the officers and men during the whole
afternoon and an unconcerned observer if any could have been
unconcerned on such an occasion would have been amused by the
eagerness with which the various reports from the crow's-nest were
received all however hitherto favourable to our most sanguine
hopes"

the two coasts extended in a parallel line as far as the eye could
reach that is to say for a distance exceeding fifty miles and the
height of the waves together with the absence of ice combined to
convince the english that they had reached the open sea by way of the
long sought passage when an island framed in masses of ice checked
their further progress

an arm of the sea however some twelve leagues wide opened on the
south and by it the explorers hoped to find a passage less encumbered
with ice strange to say as they had advanced in a westerly direction
through lancaster sound the vibrations of the pendulum had increased
whilst now it appeared to have lost all motion and "we now therefore
witnessed for the first time the curious phenomenon of the directive
power of the needle becoming so weak as to be completely overcome by
the attraction of the ship so that the needle might now be properly
said to point to the north pole of the ship"

the arm of the sea widened as the vessels advanced in a westerly
direction and the shores seemed to bend sensibly towards the
south-west but after making some 120 miles further progress was again
barred by ice the explorers therefore returned to barrow's strait of
which lancaster sound is but the entry and once more entered the sea
now free from the ice by which it had been encumbered a few days
previously

in w long 92 degrees 1 minute 4 seconds was discovered an inlet
called wellington channel about eight leagues wide entirely free from
ice and apparently not bounded by any land the existence of these
numerous straits led the explorers to the conclusion that they were in
the midst of a vast archipelago an opinion daily receiving fresh
confirmation the dense fogs however made navigation difficult and
the number of little islands and shallows increased whilst the ice
became more compact parry however was not to be deterred from
pressing on towards the west and presently his sailors found on a
large island to which the name of bathurst was given the remains of
some esquimaux huts and traces of the former presence of reindeer
magnetic observations were now taken pointing to the conclusion that
the magnetic pole had been passed on the north

another large island that of melville soon came in sight and in
spite of the fogs and ice the expedition succeeded in passing w long
110 degrees thus earning the reward of 100l sterling promised by
the english government a promontory near melville island was named
cape munificence whilst a good harbour close by was called hecla and
griper bay it was in winter harbour at the end of this bay that the
vessels passed the winter "dismantled for the most part" says parry
"the yards however being laid for walls and roofed in with thick
wadding tilts they were sheltered from the snow whilst stoves and
ovens were fixed inside" hunting was useless and resulted in nothing
but the frost-biting of the limbs of some of the hunters as melville
island was deserted at the end of october by all animals except wolves
and foxes to get through the long winter without dying of ennui was no
easy matter but the officers hit upon the plan of setting up a
theatre the first representation in which was given on the 6th
november the day of the disappearance of the sun for three months a
special piece was given on christmas day in which allusion was made to
the situation of the vessels and a weekly paper was started called the
north georgia gazette and winter chronicle which with sabine as
editor run into twenty-one numbers all printed on the return to
europe of the expedition

in january scrofula broke out and with such virulence as to cause
considerable alarm but the evil was soon checked by skilful treatment
and the daily distribution of mustard and cress which parry had
managed to grow in boxes round his stove

on the 7th february the sun reappeared and although many months must
elapse before it would be possible to leave melville island
preparations for a start were at once begun on the 30th april the
thermometer rose to zero and the sailors taking this low temperature
for summer wanted to leave off their winter clothes the first
ptarmigan appeared on the 12th may and on the following day were seen
traces of reindeer and of musk goats on their way to the north but
what caused the greatest delight and surprise to the crews was the fall
of rain on the 24th may

"we had been so unaccustomed to see water naturally in a fluid state at
all and much less to see it fall from the heavens that such an
occurrence became a matter of considerable curiosity and i believe
every person on board hastened on deck to witness so interesting as
well as novel a phenomenon"

[illustration rain as a novel phenomenon]

during the first fortnight in june parry accompanied by some of his
officers made an excursion to the most northerly part of melville
island on his return vegetation was everywhere to be seen the ice
was beginning to melt and it was evident that a start could soon be
made the vessels began to move on the 1st august but the ice had not
yet broken up in the offing and they got no further than the eastern
extremity of melville island of which the furthest point reached by
parry was in n lat 113 degrees 46 minutes 13 seconds and w long 113
degrees 46 minutes 43 seconds the voyage back was unmarked by any
special incident and the expedition got back to england towards the
middle of november

the results of this voyage were numerous and important not only had a
vast extent of the arctic regions been surveyed but physical and
magnetic observations had been taken and many new details collected on
their climate and animal and vegetable life in fact in a single trip
parry did more than was accomplished in thirty years by all who
followed in his steps

satisfied with the important results obtained by him the admiralty
appointed parry to the command in 1821 of the hecla and the fury
the latter built on the model of the former on this new trip the
explorer surveyed with the greatest care the shores of hudson's bay and
the coast of the peninsula of melville not to be confounded with the
island of the same name the winter was passed on winter island on the
eastern coast of this peninsula and the same amusements were resorted
to which had succeeded so well on the previous expedition supplemented
most effectively by the arrival on the 1st february of a party of
esquimaux from across the ice their huts which had not been
discovered by the english were built on the beach and numerous visits
paid to them during the eighteen months passed on winter island gave a
better notion than had ever before been obtained of the manners
customs character &c of this singular people

the thorough survey of the straits of fury and hecla separating the
peninsula of melville from cockburn island involved the passing of a
second winter in the arctic regions and though the quarters were now
more comfortable time dragged heavily for the officers and men were
dreadfully disappointed at having to turn back just as they had thought
to start for behring's strait on the 12th august the ice broke up and
parry wanted to send his men to europe and himself complete by land
the exploration of the districts he had discovered but captain lyon
dissuaded him from a plan so desperate the vessels therefore returned
to england with all hands after an absence of twenty-seven months
having lost but five men although two consecutive winters had been
spent in the arctic regions

although the results of the second voyage were not equal to those of
the first some of them were beyond price it was now known that the
american coast did not extend beyond the 70 degrees n lat and that
the atlantic was connected with the arctic ocean by an immense number
of straits and channels most of them the fury hecla and fox for
instance obstructed with ice brought down by the currents whilst the
ice barrier on the south-east of melville peninsula appeared permanent
that at regent's inlet was evidently the reverse it might therefore
be possible to penetrate through it to the polar basin and it was with
this end in view that the fury and hecla were once more equipped
and placed under the orders of parry

this voyage was the least fortunate of any undertaken by this skilful
seaman not on account of any falling off in his work but because he
was the victim of unlucky accidents and unfavourable circumstances
meeting for instance with an unusual quantity of ice in baffin's bay
he had the greatest trouble to reach prince regent's inlet had he
arrived three weeks earlier he would probably have been able to land on
the american coast but as it was he was obliged to make immediate
preparations for going into winter-quarters

it was no very formidable matter to this experienced officer to spend a
winter under the polar circle he knew what precautions to take to
preserve the health of his crews to keep himself well and what
occupations and amusements would best relieve the tedium of a three
months' night races between the officers masquerades and theatrical
entertainments with the temperature maintained at 50 degrees
fahrenheit kept all the men healthy and happy until the thaw which set
in on the 20th july 1825 enabled parry to resume exploring
operations

he now skirted along the eastern coast of prince regent's inlet but
the floating ice gathered about the vessels and drove them on shore
the fury was so much damaged that though four pumps were constantly
at work she could hardly be kept afloat and parry was trying to get
her repaired under shelter of a huge block of ice when a tempest came
on broke in pieces the extemporary dock and flung the vessel again
upon the shore where she had to be abandoned her crew were received
on the hecla which after such an accident as this was of course
obliged to return to england

parry's tempered spirit was not broken even by this last disaster if
the arctic ocean could not be reached from baffin's bay were there not
other routes still to be attempted? the vast tract of ocean between
greenland and spitsbergen for instance might turn out less dangerous
freer as it of necessity would be from the huge icebergs which gather
about the arctic coasts the earliest expeditions in these latitudes of
which we have any record are those of scoresby who long cruised about
them in search of whales in 1806 he penetrated in e long 16 degrees
(reckoning from paris) beyond spitzbergen ie to n lat 81 degrees
30 minutes where he saw ice stretching away in the ene whilst
between that and the se the sea was open for a distance of thirty
miles there was no land within 100 miles it seems a matter of regret
that the whaler did not take advantage of the favourable state of the
sea to have advanced yet further north when he might have made some
important discovery perhaps even have reached the pole itself

parry now resolved to do what the exigencies of his profession had
rendered impossible to scoresby and leaving london on the hecla on
the 27th march 1827 he reached lapland in safety and having at
hammerfest embarked dogs reindeer and canoes he proceeded on his way
to spitzbergen port snweerenburg where he wished to touch was still
shut in with ice and against this barrier the hecla struggled until
the 24th may when parry left her in hinlopen strait and advanced
northwards with ross crozier a dozen men and provisions for
seventy-two days in a couple of canoes after leaving a depôt of
provisions at seven islands he packed his food and boats on sledges
specially constructed for the occasion hoping to cross in them the
barrier of solid ice and to find beyond a navigable if not an entirely
open sea the ice did not however as parry expected turn out to form
a homogeneous mass there were here and there vast gaps to be forded or
steep hills to be climbed and in four days the explorers only advanced
about eight miles in a northerly direction on the 2nd july in a dense
fog the thermometer marked 1 degree 9' above zero in the shade and 8
degrees 3' in the sun and as may be imagined the march across the
broken surface gaping everywhere with fissures was terribly arduous
whilst the difficulties were aggravated by the continual glare from the
snow and ice in spite however of all obstacles the party pressed
bravely on and on the 20th july found they had got no further than n
lat 82 degrees 37 minutes ie only about five miles beyond the point
reached three days previously now as they had undoubtedly made at
least about fourteen miles in the interval it was evident that the ice
on which they were was being drifted southwards by a strong current

parry at first concealed this most discouraging fact from his men but
it soon became evident to every one that no progress was being made
but the slight difference between their own speed as they struggled
over the many obstacles in their path and that of the current bearing
the ice-field in the opposite direction moreover the expedition now
came to a place where the half-broken ice was not fit to bear the
weight of the men or of the sledges it was in fact nothing more than
an immense accumulation of blocks of ice which tossed about by the
waves made a deafening noise as they crashed against each other
provisions too were running short the men were discouraged ross was
hurt parry was suffering from inflammation of the eyes and the wind
had veered into a contrary direction driving the explorers southwards
there was nothing for it but to turn back

this venturesome trip throughout which the thermometer had not sunk
beneath 2 degrees 2 might have succeeded had it been undertaken a
little earlier in the season for then the explorers could have
penetrated beyond 82 degrees 4 minutes in any case they would
certainly not have had to turn back on account of rain snow and damp
all signs of the summer thaw

when parry got back to the hecla he found that she had been in the
greatest danger driven before a violent gale her chains had been
broken by the ice and she had been flung upon the beach and run
aground when got off she had been taken to waygat strait all dangers
past however the explorers got back safely in the rescued vessel to
the orkneys where they landed and whence they returned to london
arriving there on the 30th september

whilst parry was seeking a passage to the pacific by way of baffin's
or hudson's bay several expeditions were organized to complete the
discoveries of mackenzie and survey the north american coast these
expeditions were not fraught with any great danger and the results
might be of the most vital importance alike to geographical and
nautical science the command of the first was entrusted to franklin
afterwards so justly celebrated with whom were associated dr
richardson george back then a midshipman in the royal navy and two
common seamen

the explorers arrived on the 30th august at york factory on the shores
of hudson's bay and having obtained from the fur-hunters all the
information necessary to their success they started again on the 9th
september reaching cumberland house 690 miles further on the 22nd
october the season was now nearly at an end but franklin and back
nevertheless succeeded in penetrating to fort chippeway on the western
side of lake athabasca where they proposed making preparations for the
expedition of the ensuing summer this trip of 857 miles was
accomplished in the depth of winter with the thermometer at between 40
degrees and 50 degrees below zero

early in spring dr richardson joined the rest of the party at fort
chippeway and all started together on the 18th july 1820 in the hope
of reaching comfortable quarters at the mouth of the coppermine before
the bad season set in franklin and his people did not however make
sufficient allowance for the difficulties of the route or for the
obstacles resulting from the severity of the weather and it took them
till the 20th august to cross the waterfalls shallows lakes rivers
and portages which impeded their progress game too was scarce at the
first appearance of ice on the ponds the canadian guides began to
complain and when flocks of wild geese were seen flying southwards
they refused to go any further annoyed as he was at this absence of
good will in the people in his service franklin was compelled to give
up his schemes and when 550 miles from fort chippeway in n lat 64
degrees 28 minutes w long 118 degrees 6 minutes he built on the
banks of winter river a wooden house which he called fort enterprise

here the explorers collected as much food as they could manufacturing
with reindeer flesh what is known throughout north america as
pemmican at first the number of reindeer seen was considerable no
less than 2000 were once sighted in a single day but this was only a
proof that they were migrating to more clement latitudes the
pemmican prepared from eighty reindeer and the fish obtained in
winter river both run short before the expedition was able to proceed
whole tribes of indians on hearing of the arrival of the whites
collected about the camp greatly harassing the explorers by their
begging and soon exhausted the supply of blankets tobacco &c which
had been brought as means of barter

disappointed at the non-arrival of reinforcements with provisions
franklin sent back with an escort of canadians to fort chippeway on the
18th october

"i had the pleasure" says back writing after his return "of meeting
my friends all in good health after an absence of nearly five months
during which i travelled 1104 miles in snow-shoes and had no other
covering at night in the woods than a blanket and deerskin with the
thermometer frequently at 40 degrees and once at 57 degrees below
zero and sometimes passing two or three days without tasting food"

those who remained at the fort also suffered terribly from cold the
thermometer sinking three degrees lower than it had done when parry was
at melville island nine degrees nearer the pole not only did the men
suffer from the extreme severity of the cold but the trees were frozen
to the pith and axes broke against them without making so much as a
notch

two interpreters from hudson's bay had accompanied back to fort
enterprise one of whom had a daughter said to be the loveliest
creature ever seen and who though only sixteen had already been
married twice one of the english officers took her portrait to the
terrible distress of her mother who feared that if the "great chief of
england" saw the inanimate representation he would fall in love with
the original

on the 14th june the coppermine river was sufficiently free from ice to
be navigable and although their provisions were all but exhausted the
explorers embarked upon it as it fortunately turned out however game
was very plentiful on the green banks of the river and enough musk
oxen were killed to feed the whole party

the mouth of the coppermine was reached on the 18th july when the
indians afraid of meeting their enemies the esquimaux at once
returned to fort enterprise whilst the canadians scarcely dared to
launch their frail boats on the angry sea franklin at last succeeded
in persuading them to run the risk but he could not get them to go
further than cape turn-again in n lat 68 degrees 30 minutes a
promontory at the opening of a deep gulf dotted with islands to which
the leader of the expedition gave the name of coronation in memory of
the accession of george iv

franklin had begun to ascend hood river when he was stopped by a
cataract 250 feet high compelling him to make his way overland across
a barren unknown district and through snow more than two feet deep
the fatigue and suffering involved in this return journey can be more
easily imagined than described suffice it to say that the party
arrived on the 11th october in a state of complete exhaustion having
eaten nothing for five days at fort enterprise which they found
utterly deserted ill and without food there seemed to be nothing left
for franklin to do but to die the next day however he set to work to
look for the indians and those of his party who had started before
him but the snow was so thick he had to return without accomplishing
anything for the next eighteen days life was supported by a kind of
bouilli made from the bones and the skin of the game killed the
previous year and at last on the 29th october dr richardson arrived
with john hepburn only looking thin and worn and scarcely able to
speak above a whisper it seemed as if they were doomed we quote the
following from desborough cooley 

"dr richardson had now a melancholy tale to relate for the first two
days his party had nothing whatever to eat on the third day michel
arrived with a hare and partridge which afforded each a small morsel
then another day passed without food on the 11th michel offered them
some flesh which he said was part of a wolf but they afterwards
became convinced that it was the flesh of one of the unfortunate men
who had left captain franklin's party to return to dr richardson
michel was daily growing more insolent and shy and it was strongly
suspected that he had a hidden supply of meat for his own use on the
20th while hepburn was cutting wood near the tent he heard the report
of a gun and looking towards the spot saw michel dart into the tent
mr hood was found dead a ball had entered the back part of his head
and there could be no doubt but that michel was the murderer he now
became more mistrustful and outrageous than before and as his strength
was superior to that of the english who survived and he was well
armed they became satisfied that there was no safety for them but in
his death 'i determined' says dr richardson 'as i was thoroughly
convinced of the necessity of such a dreadful act to take the whole
responsibility upon myself and upon michel coming up i put an end to
his life by shooting him through the head'"

many of the indians who had accompanied richardson and hepburn had died
of hunger and the two leaders were on the brink of the grave when on
the 7th november three indians sent by back brought them help as
soon as they felt a little stronger the two englishmen made for the
company's settlement where they found back to whom they had twice
owed their lives on this one expedition

the results of this journey in which 5500 miles had been traversed
were of the greatest importance to geographical magnetic and
meteorological science and the coast of america had been surveyed as
far as cape turn-again

in spite of all the fatigue and suffering so bravely borne the
explorers were quite ready to make yet another attempt to reach the
shores of the polar sea and at the end of 1823 franklin received
instructions to survey the coast west of mackenzie river all the
agents of the company being ordered to supply his party with
provisions boats guides and everything else they might require

after a hearty reception at new york franklin went to albany by way
of the hudson ascended the niagara from lewiston to the famous falls
made his way thence to fort st george on the ontario crossed the
lake landed at york the capital of upper canada (sic) passed lakes
siamese huron and superior where he was joined by twenty-four
canadians and on the 29th june 1825 came to lake methye then alive
with boats

whilst dr richardson was surveying the eastern coast of great bear
lake and back was superintending the preparations for the winter
franklin reached the mouth of the mackenzie the navigation of which
was very easy no obstacles being met with except in the delta the
sea was free from ice and black and white whales and seals were
playing about at the top of the water franklin landed on the small
island of garry the position of which he determined as n lat 69
degrees 2 minutes w long 135 degrees 41 minutes a valuable fact
proving as it did how much confidence was to be placed in the
observations of mackenzie

the return journey was made without difficulty and on the 5th
september the explorers arrived at the fort to which dr richardson had
given the name of franklin the winter was passed in festivities such
as balls &c in which canadians english scotch french esquimaux
and indians of various tribes took part

on the 22nd june a fresh start was made and on the 4th july the fort
was reached where the mackenzie divides into two branches there the
expedition separated into two parties one going to the east and the
other to the west to explore the shores of the arctic ocean franklin
and his companions had hardly left the river when he met near a large
bay a numerous party of esquimaux who at first testified great delight
at the rencontre but soon became obstreperous and tried to carry off
the boat only by the exercise of wonderful patience and tact were the
english able to avert bloodshed on this emergency

franklin now surveyed and gave the name of clarence to the river
separating the english from the russian territories and a little
further on was discovered another stream which he called the canning
on the 16th april finding he had only made half of the distance
between mackenzie river and icy cape though the winter was rapidly
approaching franklin turned back and embarked on the beautiful peel
river which he mistook for that of mackenzie not discovering his
error till he came in sight of a chain of mountains on the east on the
21st september he got back to the fort after having in the course of
three months traversed 2048 miles and surveyed 372 miles of the
american coast

richardson meanwhile had advanced into much deeper water with far less
floating ice and had met with a great many esquimaux of mild and
hospitable manners he surveyed liverpool and franklin bays and
discovered opposite the mouth of the coppermine a tract of land
separated from the continent by a channel not more than twenty miles
wide to which he gave the name of wollaston his boats arrived at
coronation gulf explored on the previous trip on the 7th august and
on the 1st september they got back to fort franklin without having
sustained any damage

in dwelling on parry's voyages we have for the time turned aside
from those made at the same time by ross whose extraordinary
exploration of baffin's bay had brought upon him the censure of the
admiralty and who was anxious to regain his reputation for skill and
courage though the government had lost confidence in him he won the
esteem of a rich ship-owner who did not hesitate to entrust to him the
command of the steamship victory on which he started for baffin's
bay on the 25th may 1830

for four years nothing was heard of the courageous navigator but on
his return at the end of that time it turned out that his voyage had
been as rich in discoveries as had been parry's first trip ross
entering prince regent's inlet by way of barrow and lancaster sounds
had revisited the spot where the fury had been abandoned four years
previously and continuing his voyage in a southerly direction he
wintered in felix harbour so named after the equipper of the
expedition ascertaining whilst there that the lands he had passed
formed a large peninsula attached on the south to the northern coast of
america

in april 1830 james ross nephew of the leader of the party set out
in a canoe to examine the shores of this peninsula and those of king
william's land and in november of the same year all had once more to
go into winter-quarters in sherif harbour it being impossible to get
the vessel more than a few miles further north the cold was intense
and it was agreed by the sailors of the victory that this was the
very severest winter ever spent by them in the arctic regions

the summer of 1831 was devoted to various surveys which proved that
there was no connexion between the two seas all that was accomplished
this season was to bring the victory as far as discovery harbour a
very little further north than that of sherif the ensuing winter was
so intensely severe that the vessel could not be extricated from her
ice prison and but for the fortunate discovery of the provisions left
by the fury the english would have died of hunger as it was they
endured daily greater and greater privations and sufferings before the
summer of 1833 at last enabled them finally to leave their
winter-quarters and go by land to prince regent's and barrow straits
they had just reached the shores of baffin's bay when a vessel
appeared which turned out to be the isabel once commanded by ross
himself and which now received the refugees from the victory

but england had not all this time been forgetful of her children and
had sent an expedition in search of them every year in 1833 back
franklin's companion was the leader and he starting from fort
revolution on the shore of slave lake made his way northwards
discovered thloni-tcho-deseth river and settled down in
winter-quarters with the intention of reaching the next year the polar
sea where he supposed ross to be held prisoner when he heard of his
incredible return journey overland back therefore gave up the next
season to the survey of the fine fish river discovered the previous
year and sighted the queen adelaide mts with capes booth and ross

1836 found him at the head of a new expedition which was to attempt to
connect by sea the discoveries of ross and franklin it failed and the
accomplishment of the task assigned to it was reserved to peter
williams dease and thomas simpson all officers in the service of the
hudson's bay company who leaving fort chippeway on the 1st june
1837 went down the mackenzie arriving on the sea-coast on the 9th
july and making their way along it to n lat 71 degrees 3 minutes and
w long 156 degrees 46 minutes ie to a cape they named simpson
after the governor of their company

thomas simpson now made his way overland with five men to port barrow
already sighted in the direction of behring strait by one of beechey's
officers so that the whole of the north american coast from cape
turn-again to behring's strait was now complete and there was nothing
left to do but to explore the space between the former and point ogle
a task accomplished by the explorers in a later expedition

leaving the coppermine in 1838 they followed the eastern coast
arriving on the 9th august at cape turn-again which was too much
encumbered with ice to be rounded thomas simpson therefore remained
near it for the winter discovered victoria land and on the 12th
august 1839 arrived at back river the rest of the month he devoted
to the exploration of boothia

[illustration discovery of victoria land]

the whole of the coast-line of north america was now accurately laid
down but at the cost of what struggles devotion privations and
sufferings? what however is human life when weighed in the balance
with the progress of science? and with what disinterestedness and
enthusiasm must be embued the savants sailors and explorers who give
up all the joys of existence to contribute to the best of their power
to the progress of knowledge and to the moral and intellectual
development of humanity

with the voyages last recorded the discovery of the earth was
completed and with our account of them our work which began with the
first attempts of the earliest explorers also closes the shape of the
earth is now known the task of explorers is done the land on which
man lives is henceforth familiar to him and he has now only to turn to
account the vast resources of the countries to which access has
recently become easy or of which he can without difficulty possess
himself

how rich in lessons of every kind is this history of twenty centuries
of exploration let us cast a glance behind us and enumerate the main
features of the progress made in this long series of years if we take
the map of the world of hecatæus who lived 500 years before the
christian era what do we see? when it was published the known world
did not extend beyond the basin of the mediterranean and the whole
with a terribly distorted outline is represented only by a very small
portion of southern europe the interior of asia and part of north
africa whilst encircling them all is a river without beginning or end
to which is given the name of ocean

side by side with this map ancient monument as it is of antique
science let us place a planisphere representing the world as known in
1840 and on this vast surface we shall find the portion known and
that but imperfectly to hecatæus occupying but an infinitesimal space

taking these two typical maps as our starting-point we shall be able
to judge of the magnitude of the discoveries of modern times imagine
for a moment all that is involved in thorough knowledge of the whole
world and you will marvel at the results achieved by the efforts of so
many explorers and martyrs you will grasp the importance of their
discoveries and the intimate relations between geography and all the
other sciences this is the point of view from which can best be seen
all the philosophic bearings of a work to which so many generations
have devoted themselves

doubtless the motives actuating these various explorers differ greatly
first we have the natural curiosity of the owner anxious to know
thoroughly every part of the domain belonging to him so that he may
estimate the extent of the habitable districts and determine the
boundaries of the seas &c and secondly we have the natural outcome
of a trade which though still in its infancy introduced even in
remote norway the products of central asian industry in the time of
herodotus the aim of explorers was loftier they wished to learn the
history manners customs and religion of foreign races and later
the crusades which whatever else they accomplished certainly
vulgarized oriental studies inspired some few with a fervent desire to
wrest from infidels the scene of our lord's passion but the greater
number with a lust of pillage and a yearning to explore the unknown

columbus seeking a new route to the indies came across america on the
way and his successors were only anxious to make rapid fortunes
differing greatly indeed from the noble portuguese who sacrificed their
private interests to the glory and colonial prosperity of their
country and were the poorer for the offices conferred on them with a
view to doing them honour

in the sixteenth century religious persecution and civil war drove to
the new world the huguenots and puritans who whilst laying for
england the foundations of colonial prosperity were to bring about a
radical change in america the next century was essentially one of
colonization in america the french in india the english and in
oceania the dutch established counting-houses and offices whilst
missionaries endeavoured to win over to the christian faith and modern
ideas the unchangeable "empire of the mean"

the eighteenth century ushering in our own rectified received errors
and surveyed minutely alike continents and archipelagoes in a word
brought to perfection the work of its predecessors the same task has
occupied modern explorers who pride themselves on not passing over in
their surveys the smallest corner of the earth or the tiniest islet
with a similar enthusiasm are imbued the intrepid navigators who
penetrate the ice-bound solitudes of the two poles and tear away the
last fragments of the veil which has so long hidden from us the
extremities of the globe

all then is now known classed catalogued and labelled will the
results of so much toil be buried in some carefully laid down atlas to
be sought only by professional savants? no it is reserved to our
use and to develope the resources of the globe conquered for us by
our fathers at the cost of so much danger and fatigue our heritage is
too grand to be relinquished we have at our command all the facilities
of modern science for surveying clearing and working our property no
more lands lying fallow no more impassable deserts no more useless
streams no more unfathomable seas no more inaccessible mountains

we suppress the obstacles nature throws in our way the isthmuses of
panama and suez are in our way we cut through them the sahara
interferes with the connexion of algeria and senegal we will throw a
railway across it the pas de calais prevents two nations so well
fitted for cordial friendship from shaking each other by the hand we
will pierce it with a railway

this is our task and that of our contemporaries is it less grand than
that of our predecessors that it has not yet succeeded in inspiring
any great writer of fiction? to dwell upon it ourselves would be to
exceed the limits we laid down for our work we meant to write the
history of the discovery of the world and we have written it our task

introduction by the author

many years have elapsed since i quitted europe to explore the
interior of the new continent devoted from my earliest youth to
the study of nature feeling with enthusiasm the wild beauties of a
country guarded by mountains and shaded by ancient forests i
experienced in my travels enjoyments which have amply compensated
for the privations inseparable from a laborious and often agitated
life these enjoyments which i endeavoured to impart to my readers
in my 'remarks upon the steppes' and in the 'essay on the
physiognomy of plants' were not the only fruits i reaped from an
undertaking formed with the design of contributing to the progress
of natural philosophy i had long prepared myself for the
observations which were the principal object of my journey to the
torrid zone i was provided with instruments of easy and convenient
use constructed by the ablest makers and i enjoyed the special
protection of a government which far from presenting obstacles to
my investigations constantly honoured me with every mark of regard
and confidence i was aided by a courageous and enlightened friend
and it was singularly propitious to the success of our participated
labour that the zeal and equanimity of that friend never failed
amidst the fatigues and dangers to which we were sometimes exposed

under these favourable circumstances traversing regions which for
ages have remained almost unknown to most of the nations of europe
i might add even to spain m bonpland and myself collected a
considerable number of materials the publication of which may
throw some light on the history of nations and advance the study
of nature

i had in view a two-fold purpose in the travels of which i now
publish the historical narrative i wished to make known the
countries i had visited and to collect such facts as are fitted to
elucidate a science of which we as yet possess scarcely the
outline and which has been vaguely denominated natural history of
the world theory of the earth or physical geography the last of
these two objects seemed to me the most important i was
passionately devoted to botany and certain parts of zoology and i
flattered myself that our investigations might add some new species
to those already known both in the animal and vegetable kingdoms
but preferring the connection of facts which have been long
observed to the knowledge of insulated facts although new the
discovery of an unknown genus seemed to me far less interesting
than an observation on the geographical relations of the vegetable
world on the migrations of the social plants and the limit of the
height which their different tribes attain on the flanks of the
cordilleras

the natural sciences are connected by the same ties which link
together all the phenomena of nature the classification of the
species which must be considered as the fundamental part of
botany and the study of which is rendered attractive and easy by
the introduction of natural methods is to the geography of plants
what descriptive mineralogy is to the indication of the rocks
constituting the exterior crust of the globe to comprehend the
laws observed in the position of these rocks to determine the age
of their successive formations and their identity in the most
distant regions the geologist should be previously acquainted with
the simple fossils which compose the mass of mountains and of
which the names and character are the object of oryctognostical
knowledge it is the same with that part of the natural history of
the globe which treats of the relations plants have to each other
to the soil whence they spring or to the air which they inhale and
modify the progress of the geography of plants depends in a great
measure on that of descriptive botany and it would be injurious to
the advancement of science to attempt rising to general ideas
whilst neglecting the knowledge of particular facts

i have been guided by these considerations in the course of my
inquiries they were always present to my mind during the period of
my preparatory studies when i began to read the numerous
narratives of travels which compose so interesting a part of
modern literature i regretted that travellers the most
enlightened in the insulated branches of natural history were
seldom possessed of sufficient variety of knowledge to avail
themselves of every advantage arising from their position it
appeared to me that the importance of the results hitherto
obtained did not keep pace with the immense progress which at the
end of the eighteenth century had been made in several departments
of science particularly geology the history of the modifications
of the atmosphere and the physiology of animals and plants i saw
with regret (and all scientific men have shared this feeling) that
whilst the number of accurate instruments was daily increasing we
were still ignorant of the height of many mountains and elevated
plains of the periodical oscillations of the aerial ocean of the
limit of perpetual snow within the polar circle and on the borders
of the torrid zone of the variable intensity of the magnetic
forces and of many other phenomena equally important

maritime expeditions and circumnavigatory voyages have conferred
just celebrity on the names of the naturalists and astronomers who
have been appointed by various governments to share the dangers of
those undertakings but though these eminent men have given us
precise notions of the external configuration of countries of the
natural history of the ocean and of the productions of islands and
coasts it must be admitted that maritime expeditions are less
fitted to advance the progress of geology and other parts of
physical science than travels into the interior of a continent
the advancement of the natural sciences has been subordinate to
that of geography and nautical astronomy during a voyage of
several years the land but seldom presents itself to the
observation of the mariner and when after lengthened expectation
it is descried he often finds it stripped of its most beautiful
productions sometimes beyond a barren coast he perceives a ridge
of mountains covered with verdure but its distance forbids
examination and the view serves only to excite regret

journeys by land are attended with considerable difficulties in the
conveyance of instruments and collections but these difficulties
are compensated by advantages which it is unnecessary to enumerate
it is not by sailing along a coast that we can discover the
direction of chains of mountains and their geological
constitution the climate of each zone and its influence on the
forms and habits of organized beings in proportion to the extent
of continents the greater on the surface of the soil are the
riches of animal and vegetable productions the more distant the
central chain of mountains from the sea-shore the greater is the
variety in the bosom of the earth of those stony strata the
regular succession of which unfolds the history of our planet as
every being considered apart is impressed with a particular type
so in like manner we find the same distinctive impression in the
arrangement of brute matter organized in rocks and also in the
distribution and mutual relations of plants and animals the great
problem of the physical description of the globe is the
determination of the form of these types the laws of their
relations with each other and the eternal ties which link the
phenomena of life and those of inanimate nature

having stated the general object i had in view in my expeditions i
will now hasten to give a slight sketch of the whole of the
collections and observations which we have accumulated and the
union of which is the aim and end of every scientific journey the
maritime war during our abode in america having rendered
communication with europe very uncertain we found ourselves
compelled in order to diminish the chance of losses to form three
different collections of these the first was embarked for spain
and france the second for the united states and england and the
third which was the most considerable remained almost constantly
under our own eyes towards the close of our expedition this last
collection formed forty-two boxes containing an herbal of six
thousand equinoctial plants seeds shells insects and (what had
hitherto never been brought to europe) geological specimens from
the chimborazo new grenada and the banks of the river amazon

after our journey to the orinoco we left a part of these
collections at the island of cuba intending to take them on our
return from peru to mexico the rest followed us during the space
of five years on the chain of the andes across new spain from
the shores of the pacific to the coasts of the caribbean sea the
conveyance of these objects and the minute care they required
occasioned embarrassments scarcely conceiveable even by those who
have traversed the most uncultivated parts of europe our progress
was often retarded by the necessity of dragging after us during
expeditions of five or six months twelve fifteen and sometimes
more than twenty loaded mules exchanging these animals every eight
or ten days and superintending the indians who were employed in
driving the numerous caravan often in order to add to our
collections of new mineral substances we found ourselves obliged
to throw away others which we had collected a considerable time
before these sacrifices were not less vexatious than the losses we
accidentally sustained sad experience taught us but too late that
from the sultry humidity of the climate and the frequent falls of
the beasts of burden we could preserve neither the skins of
animals hastily prepared nor the fishes and reptiles placed in
phials filled with alcohol i enter into these details because
though little interesting in themselves they serve to show that we
had no means of bringing back in their natural state many objects
of zoology and comparative anatomy of which we have published
descriptions and drawings notwithstanding some obstacles and the
expense occasioned by the carriage of these articles i had reason
to applaud the resolution i had taken before my departure of
sending to europe the duplicates only of the productions we
collected i cannot too often repeat that when the seas are
infested with privateers a traveller can be sure only of the
objects in his own possession a very few of the duplicates which
we shipped for europe during our abode in america were saved the
greater part fell into the hands of persons who feel no interest
for science when a ship is condemned in a foreign port boxes
containing only dried plants or stones instead of being sent to
the scientific men to whom they are addressed are put aside and
forgotten some of our geological collections taken in the pacific
were however more fortunate we were indebted for their
preservation to the generous activity of sir joseph banks
president of the royal society of london who amidst the political
agitations of europe unceasingly laboured to strengthen the bonds
of union between scientific men of all nations

in our investigations we have considered each phenomenon under
different aspects and classed our remarks according to the
relations they bear to each other to afford an idea of the method
we have followed i will here add a succinct enumeration of the
materials with which we were furnished for describing the volcanoes
of antisana and pichincha as well as that of jorullo the latter
during the night of the 20th of september 1759 rose from the
earth one thousand five hundred and seventy-eight french feet above
the surrounding plains of mexico the position of these singular
mountains in longitude and latitude was ascertained by astronomical
observations we took the heights of the different parts by the aid
of the barometer and determined the dip of the needle and the
intensity of the magnetic forces our collections contain the
plants which are spread over the flanks of these volcanoes and
specimens of different rocks which superposed one upon another
constitute their external coat we are enabled to indicate by
measures sufficiently exact the height above the level of the
ocean at which we found each group of plants and each volcanic
rock our journals furnish us with a series of observations on the
humidity the temperature the electricity and the degree of
transparency of the air on the brinks of the craters of pichincha
and jorullo they also contain topographical plans and geological
profiles of these mountains founded in part on the measure of
vertical bases and on angles of altitude each observation has
been calculated according to the tables and the methods which are
considered most exact in the present state of our knowledge and in
order to judge of the degree of confidence which the results may
claim we have preserved the whole detail of our partial
operations

it would have been possible to blend these different materials in a
work devoted wholly to the description of the volcanoes of peru and
new spain had i given the physical description of a single
province i could have treated separately everything relating to
its geography mineralogy and botany but how could i interrupt
the narrative of a journey a disquisition on the manners of a
people or the great phenomena of nature by an enumeration of the
productions of the country the description of new species of
animals and plants or the detail of astronomical observations had
i adopted a mode of composition which would have included in one
and the same chapter all that has been observed on one particular
point of the globe i should have prepared a work of cumbrous
length and devoid of that clearness which arises in a great
measure from the methodical distribution of matter notwithstanding
the efforts i have made to avoid in this narrative the errors i
had to dread i feel conscious that i have not always succeeded in
separating the observations of detail from those general results
which interest every enlightened mind these results comprise in
one view the climate and its influence on organized beings the
aspect of the country varied according to the nature of the soil
and its vegetable covering the direction of the mountains and
rivers which separate races of men as well as tribes of plants and
finally the modifications observable in the condition of people
living in different latitudes and in circumstances more or less
favourable to the development of their faculties i do not fear
having too much enlarged on objects so worthy of attention one of
the noblest characteristics which distinguish modern civilization
from that of remoter times is that it has enlarged the mass of our
conceptions rendered us more capable of perceiving the connection
between the physical and intellectual world and thrown a more
general interest over objects which heretofore occupied only a few
scientific men because those objects were contemplated separately
and from a narrower point of view

as it is probable that these volumes will obtain the attention of a
greater number of readers than the detail of my observations merely
scientific or my researches on the population the commerce and
the mines of new spain i may be permitted here to enumerate all
the works which i have hitherto published conjointly with m
bonpland when several works are interwoven in some sort with each
other it may perhaps be interesting to the reader to know the
sources whence he may obtain more circumstantial information

1i1 astronomical observations trigonometrical operations and
  barometrical measurements made during the course of a journey to
  the equinoctial regions of the new continent from 1799 to 1804

this work to which are added historical researches on the position
of several points important to navigators contains first the
original observations which i made from the twelfth degree of
southern to the forty-first degree of northern latitude the
transits of the sun and stars over the meridian distances of the
moon from the sun and the stars occultations of the satellites
eclipses of the sun and moon transits of mercury over the disc of
the sun azimuths circum-meridian altitudes of the moon to
determine the longitude by the differences of declination
researches on the relative intensity of the light of the austral
stars geodesical measures etc secondly a treatise on the
astronomical refractions in the torrid zone considered as the
effect of the decrement of caloric in the strata of the air
thirdly the barometric measurement of the cordillera of the andes
of mexico of the province of venezuela of the kingdom of quito
and of new grenada followed by geological observations and
containing the indication of four hundred and fifty-three heights
calculated according to the method of m laplace and the new
co-efficient of m ramond fourthly a table of near seven hundred
geographical positions on the new continent two hundred and
thirty-five of which have been determined by my own observations
according to the three co-ordinates of longitude latitude and
height

1i2 equinoctial plants collected in mexico in the island of
  cuba in the provinces of caracas cumana and barcelona on the
  andes of new grenada quito and peru and on the banks of the rio
  negro the orinoco and the river amazon

m bonpland has in this work given figures of more than forty new
genera of plants of the torrid zone classed according to their
natural families the methodical descriptions of the species are
both in french and latin and are accompanied by observations on
the medicinal properties of the plants their use in the arts and
the climate of the countries in which they are found

1i3 monography of the melastoma rhexia and other genera of
  this order of plants

comprising upwards of a hundred and fifty species of melastomaceae
which we collected during the course of our expeditions and which
form one of the most beautiful ornaments of tropical vegetation m
bonpland has added the plants of the same family which among many
other rich stores of natural history m richard collected in his
interesting expedition to the antilles and french guiana and the
descriptions of which he has communicated to us

1i4 essay on the geography of plants accompanied by a physical
  table of the equinoctial regions founded on measures taken from
  the tenth degree of northern to the tenth degree of southern
  latitude

i have endeavoured to collect in one point of view the whole of the
physical phenomena of that part of the new continent comprised
within the limits of the torrid zone from the level of the pacific
to the highest summit of the andes namely the vegetation the
animals the geological relations the cultivation of the soil the
temperature of the air the limit of perpetual snow the chemical
constitution of the atmosphere its electrical intensity its
barometrical pressure the decrement of gravitation the intensity
of the azure colour of the sky the diminution of light during its
passage through the successive strata of the air the horizontal
refractions and the heat of boiling water at different heights
fourteen scales disposed side by side with a profile of the andes
indicate the modifications to which these phenomena are subject
from the influence of the elevation of the soil above the level of
the sea each group of plants is placed at the height which nature
has assigned to it and we may follow the prodigious variety of
their forms from the region of the palms and arborescent ferns to
those of the johannesia (chuquiraga juss) the gramineous plants
and lichens these regions form the natural divisions of the
vegetable empire and as perpetual snow is found in each climate at
a determinate height so in like manner the febrifuge species of
the quinquina (cinchona) have their fixed limits which i have
marked in the botanical chart belonging to this essay

1i5 observations on zoology and comparative anatomy

i have comprised in this work the history of the condor
experiments on the electrical action of the gymnotus a treatise on
the larynx of the crocodiles the quadrumani and birds of the
tropics the description of several new species of reptiles
fishes birds monkeys and other mammalia but little known m
cuvier has enriched this work with a very comprehensive treatise on
the axolotl of the lake of mexico and on the genera of the protei
that naturalist has also recognized two new species of mastodons
and an elephant among the fossil bones of quadrupeds which we
brought from north and south america for the description of the
insects collected by m bonpland we are indebted to m latreille
whose labours have so much contributed to the progress of
entomology in our times the second volume of this work contains
figures of the mexican peruvian and aturian skulls which we have
deposited in the museum of natural history at paris and respecting
which blumenbach has published observations in the 'decas quinta
craniorum diversarum gentium'

1i6 political essay on the kingdom of new spain with a physical
  and geographical atlas founded on astronomical observations and
  trigonometrical and barometrical measurements

this work based on numerous official memoirs presents in six
divisions considerations on the extent and natural appearance of
mexico on the population on the manners of the inhabitants their
ancient civilization and the political division of their
territory it embraces also the agriculture the mineral riches
the manufactures the commerce the finances and the military
defence of that vast country in treating these different subjects
i have endeavoured to consider them under a general point of view
i have drawn a parallel not only between new spain the other
spanish colonies and the united states of north america but also
between new spain and the possessions of the english in asia i
have compared the agriculture of the countries situated in the
torrid zone with that of the temperate climates and i have
examined the quantity of colonial produce necessary to europe in
the present state of civilization in tracing the geological
description of the richest mining districts in mexico i have in
short given a statement of the mineral produce the population
the imports and exports of the whole of spanish america i have
examined several questions which for want of precise data had not
hitherto been treated with the attention they demand such as the
influx and reflux of metals their progressive accumulation in
europe and asia and the quantity of gold and silver which since
the discovery of america down to our own times the old world has
received from the new the geographical introduction at the
beginning of this work contains the analysis of the materials which
have been employed in the construction of the mexican atlas

1i7 views of the cordilleras and monuments of the indigenous
  nations of the new continent* (*atlas pittoresque ou vues des
  cordilleres 1 volume folio with 69 plates part of which are
  coloured accompanied by explanatory treatises this work may be
  considered as the atlas to the historical narrative of the travels)

this work is intended to represent a few of the grand scenes which
nature presents in the lofty chain of the andes and at the same
time to throw some light on the ancient civilization of the
americans through the study of their monuments of architecture
their hieroglyphics their religious rites and their astrological
reveries i have given in this work a description of the teocalli
or mexican pyramids and have compared their structure with that of
the temple of belus i have described the arabesques which cover
the ruins of mitla the idols in basalt ornamented with the
calantica of the heads of isis and also a considerable number of
symbolical paintings representing the serpent-woman (the mexican
eve) the deluge of coxcox and the first migrations of the natives
of the aztec race i have endeavoured to prove the striking
analogies existing between the calendar of the toltecs and the
catasterisms of their zodiac and the division of time of the
people of tartary and thibet as well as the mexican traditions on
the four regenerations of the globe the pralayas of the hindoos
and the four ages of hesiod in this work i have also included (in
addition to the hieroglyphical paintings i brought to europe)
fragments of all the aztec manuscripts collected in rome veletri
vienna and dresden and one of which reminds us by its lineary
symbols of the kouas of the chinese together with the rude
monuments of the aborigines of america this volume contains
picturesque views of the mountainous countries which those people
inhabited for example the cataract of tequendama chimborazo the
volcano of jorullo and cayambe the pyramidal summit of which
covered with eternal ice is situated directly under the
equinoctial line in every zone the configuration of the ground
the physiognomy of the plants and the aspect of lovely or wild
scenery have great influence on the progress of the arts and on
the style which distinguishes their productions this influence is
so much the more perceptible in proportion as man is farther
removed from civilization

i could have added to this work researches on the character of
languages which are the most durable monuments of nations i have
collected a number of materials on the languages of america of
which mm frederic schlegel and vater have made use the former in
his considerations on the hindoos the latter in his continuation
of the mithridates of adelung in the ethnographical magazine and
in his inquiries into the population of the new continent these
materials are now in the hands of my brother william von humboldt
who during his travels in spain and a long abode at rome formed
the richest collection of american vocabularies in existence his
extensive knowledge of the ancient and modern languages has enabled
him to trace some curious analogies in relation to this subject so
important to the philosophical study of the history of man a part
of his labours will find a place in this narrative

of the different works which i have here enumerated the second and
third were composed by m bonpland from the observations which he
made in a botanical journal this journal contains more than four
thousand methodical descriptions of equinoctial plants a ninth
part only of which have been made by me they appear in a separate
publication under the title of nova genera et species plantariem
in this work will be found not only the new species we collected
which after a careful examination by one of the first botanists of
the age professor willdenouw are computed to amount to fourteen
or fifteen hundred but also the interesting observations made by
m bonpland on plants hitherto imperfectly described the plates of
this work are all engraved according to the method followed by m
labillardiere in the specimen planterum novae hollandiae a work
remarkable for profound research and clearness of arrangement

after having distributed into separate works all that belongs to
astronomy botany zoology the political description of new spain
and the history of the ancient civilization of certain nations of
the new continent there still remained many general results and
local descriptions which i might have collected into separate
treatises i had during my journey prepared papers on the races
of men in south america on the missions of the orinoco on the
obstacles to the progress of society in the torrid zone arising
from the climate and the strength of vegetation on the character
of the landscape in the cordilleras of the andes compared with that
of the alps in switzerland on the analogies between the rocks of
the two hemispheres on the physical constitution of the air in the
equinoctial regions etc i had left europe with the firm intention
of not writing what is usually called the historical narrative of a
journey but to publish the fruit of my inquiries in works merely
descriptive and i had arranged the facts not in the order in
which they successively presented themselves but according to the
relation they bore to each other amidst the overwhelming majesty
of nature and the stupendous objects she presents at every step
the traveller is little disposed to record in his journal matters
which relate only to himself and the ordinary details of life

i composed a very brief itinerary during the course of my
excursions on the rivers of south america and in my long journeys
by land i regularly described (and almost always on the spot) the
visits i made to the summits of volcanoes or mountains remarkable
for their height but the entries in my journal were interrupted
whenever i resided in a town or when other occupations prevented
me from continuing a work which i considered as having only a
secondary interest whenever i wrote in my journal i had no other
motive than the preservation of some of those fugitive ideas which
present themselves to a naturalist whose life is almost wholly
passed in the open air i wished to make a temporary collection of
such facts as i had not then leisure to class and note down the
first impressions whether agreeable or painful which i received
from nature or from man far from thinking at the time that those
pages thus hurriedly written would form the basis of an extensive
work to be offered to the public it appeared to me that my
journal though it might furnish certain data useful to science
would present very few of those incidents the recital of which
constitutes the principal charm of an itinerary

the difficulties i have experienced since my return in the
composition of a considerable number of treatises for the purpose
of making known certain classes of phenomena insensibly overcame
my repugnance to write the narrative of my journey in undertaking
this task i have been guided by the advice of many estimable
persons who honour me with their friendship i also perceived that
such a preference is given to this sort of composition that
scientific men after having presented in an isolated form the
account of their researches on the productions the manners and
the political state of the countries through which they have
passed imagine that they have not fulfilled their engagements with
the public till they have written their itinerary

an historical narrative embraces two very distinct objects the
greater or the less important events connected with the purpose of
the traveller and the observations he has made during his journey
the unity of composition also which distinguishes good works from
those on an ill-constructed plan can be strictly observed only
when the traveller describes what has passed under his own eye and
when his principal attention has been fixed less on scientific
observations than on the manners of different people and the great
phenomena of nature now the most faithful picture of manners is
that which best displays the relations of men towards each other
the character of savage or civilized life is portrayed either in
the obstacles a traveller meets with or in the sensations he
feels it is the traveller himself whom we continually desire to
see in contact with the objects which surround him and his
narration interests us the more when a local tint is diffused over
the description of a country and its inhabitants such is the
source of the interest excited by the history of those early
navigators who impelled by intrepidity rather than by science
struggled against the elements in their search for the discovery of
a new world such is the irresistible charm attached to the fate of
that enterprising traveller (mungo park) who full of enthusiasm
and energy penetrated alone into the centre of africa to discover
amidst barbarous nations the traces of ancient civilization

in proportion as travels have been undertaken by persons whose
views have been directed to researches into descriptive natural
history geography or political economy itineraries have partly
lost that unity of composition and that simplicity which
characterized those of former ages it is now become scarcely
possible to connect so many different materials with the detail of
other events and that part of a traveller's narrative which we may
call dramatic gives way to dissertations merely descriptive the
numerous class of readers who prefer agreeable amusement to solid
instruction have not gained by the exchange and i am afraid that
the temptation will not be great to follow the course of travellers
who are incumbered with scientific instruments and collections

to give greater variety to my work i have often interrupted the
historical narrative by descriptions i first represent phenomena
in the order in which they appeared and i afterwards consider them
in the whole of their individual relations this mode has been
successfully followed in the journey of m de saussure whose most
valuable work has contributed more than any other to the
advancement of science often amidst dry discussions on
meteorology it contains many charming descriptions such as those
of the modes of life of the inhabitants of the mountains the
dangers of hunting the chamois and the sensations felt on the
summit of the higher alps

there are details of ordinary life which it may be useful to note
in an itinerary because they serve for the guidance of those who
afterwards journey through the same countries i have preserved a
few but have suppressed the greater part of those personal
incidents which present no particular interest and which can be
rendered amusing only by the perfection of style

with respect to the country which has been the object of my
investigations i am fully sensible of the great advantages enjoyed
by persons who travel in greece egypt the banks of the euphrates
and the islands of the pacific in comparison with those who
traverse the continent of america in the old world nations and
the distinctions of their civilization form the principal points in
the picture in the new world man and his productions almost
disappear amidst the stupendous display of wild and gigantic
nature the human race in the new world presents only a few
remnants of indigenous hordes slightly advanced in civilization
or it exhibits merely the uniformity of manners and institutions
transplanted by european colonists to foreign shores information
which relates to the history of our species to the various forms
of government to monuments of art to places full of great
remembrances affect us far more than descriptions of those vast
solitudes which seem destined only for the development of vegetable
life and to be the domain of wild animals the savages of america
who have been the objects of so many systematic reveries and on
whom m volney has lately published some accurate and intelligent
observations inspire less interest since celebrated navigators
have made known to us the inhabitants of the south sea islands in
whose character we find a striking mixture of perversity and
meekness the state of half-civilization existing among those
islanders gives a peculiar charm to the description of their
manners a king followed by a numerous suite presents the fruits
of his orchard or a funeral is performed amidst the shade of the
lofty forest such pictures no doubt have more attraction than
those which pourtray the solemn gravity of the inhabitant of the
banks of the missouri or the maranon

america offers an ample field for the labours of the naturalist on
no other part of the globe is he called upon more powerfully by
nature to raise himself to general ideas on the cause of phenomena
and their mutual connection to say nothing of that luxuriance of
vegetation that eternal spring of organic life those climates
varying by stages as we climb the flanks of the cordilleras and
those majestic rivers which a celebrated writer (m chateaubriand)
has described with such graceful accuracy the resources which the
new world affords for the study of geology and natural philosophy
in general have been long since acknowledged happy the traveller
who may cherish the hope that he has availed himself of the
advantages of his position and that he has added some new facts to
the mass of those previously acquired

since i left america one of those great revolutions which at
certain periods agitate the human race has broken out in the
spanish colonies and seems to prepare new destinies for a
population of fourteen millions of inhabitants spreading from the
southern to the northern hemisphere from the shores of the rio de
la plata and chile to the remotest part of mexico deep
resentments excited by colonial legislation and fostered by
mistrustful policy have stained with blood regions which had
enjoyed for the space of nearly three centuries what i will not
call happiness but uninterrupted peace at quito several of the
most virtuous and enlightened citizens have perished victims of
devotion to their country while i am giving the description of
regions the remembrance of which is so dear to me i continually
light on places which recall to my mind the loss of a friend

when we reflect on the great political agitations of the new world
we observe that the spanish americans are by no means in so
favourable a position as the inhabitants of the united states the
latter having been prepared for independence by the long enjoyment
of constitutional liberty internal dissensions are chiefly to be
dreaded in regions where civilization is but slightly rooted and
where from the influence of climate forests may soon regain their
empire over cleared lands if their culture be abandoned it may
also be feared that during a long series of years no foreign
traveller will be enabled to traverse all the countries which i
have visited this circumstance may perhaps add to the interest of
a work which pourtrays the state of the greater part of the spanish
colonies at the beginning of the 19th century i even venture to
indulge the hope that this work will be thought worthy of attention
when passions shall be hushed into peace and when under the
influence of a new social order those countries shall have made
rapid progress in public welfare if then some pages of my book are
snatched from oblivion the inhabitant of the banks of the orinoco
and the atabapo will behold with delight populous cities enriched
by commerce and fertile fields cultivated by the hands of free
men on those very spots where at the time of my travels i found
only impenetrable forests and inundated lands

departure from spain
landing at the canary islands

from my earliest youth i felt an ardent desire to travel into
distant regions seldom visited by europeans this desire is
characteristic of a period of our existence when appears an
unlimited horizon and when we find an irresistible attraction in
the impetuous agitations of the mind and the image of positive
danger though educated in a country which has no direct
communication with either the east or the west indies living
amidst mountains remote from coasts and celebrated for their
numerous mines i felt an increasing passion for the sea and
distant expeditions objects with which we are acquainted only by
the animated narratives of travellers have a peculiar charm
imagination wanders with delight over that which is vague and
undefined and the pleasures we are deprived of seem to possess a
fascinating power compared with which all we daily feel in the
narrow circle of sedentary life appears insipid the taste for
herborisation the study of geology rapid excursions to holland
england and france with the celebrated mr george forster who
had the happiness to accompany captain cook in his second
expedition round the globe contributed to give a determined
direction to the plan of travels which i had formed at eighteen
years of age no longer deluded by the agitation of a wandering
life i was anxious to contemplate nature in all her variety of
wild and stupendous scenery and the hope of collecting some facts
useful to the advancement of science incessantly impelled my
wishes towards the luxuriant regions of the torrid zone as
personal circumstances then prevented me from executing the
projects by which i was so powerfully influenced i had leisure to
prepare myself during six years for the observations i proposed to
make on the new continent as well as to visit different parts of
europe and to explore the lofty chain of the alps the structure
of which i might afterwards compare with that of the andes of quito
and of peru

i had traversed a part of italy in 1795 but had not been able to
visit the volcanic regions of naples and sicily and i regretted
leaving europe without having seen vesuvius stromboli and etna i
felt that in order to form a proper judgment of many geological
phenomena especially of the nature of the rocks of trap-formation
it was necessary to examine the phenomena presented by burning
volcanoes i determined therefore to return to italy in the month
of november 1797 i made a long stay at vienna where the fine
collections of exotic plants and the friendship of messrs de
jacquin and joseph van der schott were highly useful to my
preparatory studies i travelled with m leopold von buch through
several cantons of salzburg and styria countries alike interesting
to the landscape-painter and the geologist but just when i was
about to cross the tyrolese alps the war then raging in italy
obliged me to abandon the project of going to naples

a short time before a gentleman passionately fond of the fine
arts and who had visited the coasts of greece and illyria to
inspect their monuments made me a proposal to accompany him in an
expedition to upper egypt this expedition was to occupy only eight
months provided with astronomical instruments and able
draughtsmen we were to ascend the nile as far as assouan after
minutely examining the positions of the said between tentyris and
the cataracts though my views had not hitherto been fixed on any
region but the tropics i could not resist the temptation of
visiting countries so celebrated in the annals of human
civilization i therefore accepted this proposition but with the
express condition that on our return to alexandria i should be at
liberty to continue my journey through syria and palestine the
studies which i entered upon with a view to this new project i
afterwards found useful when i examined the relations between the
barbarous monuments of mexico and those belonging to the nations
of the old world i thought myself on the point of embarking for
egypt when political events forced me to abandon a plan which
promised me so much satisfaction

an expedition of discovery in the south sea under the direction of
captain baudin was then preparing in france the plan was great
bold and worthy of being executed by a more enlightened commander
the purpose of this expedition was to visit the spanish possessions
of south america from the mouth of the river plata to the kingdom
of quito and the isthmus of panama after visiting the archipelago
of the pacific and exploring the coasts of new holland from van
diemen's land to that of nuyts both vessels were to stop at
madagascar and return by the cape of good hope i was in paris
when the preparations for this voyage were begun i had but little
confidence in the personal character of captain baudin who had
given cause of discontent to the court of vienna when he was
commissioned to conduct to brazil one of my friends the young
botanist van der schott but as i could not hope with my own
resources to make a voyage of such extent and view so fine a
portion of the globe i determined to take the chances of this
expedition i obtained permission to embark with the instruments i
had collected in one of the vessels destined for the south sea
and i reserved to myself the liberty of leaving captain baudin
whenever i thought proper m michaux who had already visited
persia and a part of north america and m bonpland with whom i
then formed the friendship that still unites us were appointed to
accompany this expedition as naturalists

i had flattered myself during several months with the idea of
sharing the labours directed to so great and honourable an object
when the war which broke out in germany and italy determined the
french government to withdraw the funds granted for their voyage of
discovery and adjourn it to an indefinite period deeply mortified
at finding the plans i had formed during many years of my life
overthrown in a single day i sought at any risk the speediest
means of quitting europe and engaging in some enterprise which
might console me for my disappointment

i became acquainted with a swedish consul named skioldebrand who
having been appointed by his court to carry presents to the dey of
algiers was passing through paris to embark at marseilles this
estimable man had resided a long time on the coast of africa and
being highly respected by the government of algiers he could
easily procure me permission to visit that part of the chain of the
atlas which had not been the object of the important researches of
m desfontaines he despatched every year a vessel for tunis where
the pilgrims embarked for mecca and he promised to convey me by
the same medium to egypt i eagerly seized so favourable an
opportunity and thought myself on the point of executing a plan
which i had formed previously to my arrival in france no
mineralogist had yet examined that lofty chain of mountains which
in the empire of morocco rises to the limits of the perpetual
snow i flattered myself that after executing some operations in
the alpine regions of barbary i should receive in egypt from those
illustrious men who had for some months formed the institute of
cairo the same kind attentions with which i had been honoured
during my abode in paris i hastily completed my collection of
instruments and purchased works relating to the countries i was
going to visit i parted from a brother who by his advice and
example had hitherto exercised a great influence on the direction
of my thoughts he approved the motives which determined me to quit
europe a secret voice assured us that we should meet again and
that hope which did not prove delusive assuaged the pain of a
long separation i left paris with the intention of embarking for
algiers and egypt but by one of those vicissitudes which sway the
affairs of this life i returned to my brother from the river
amazon and peru without having touched the continent of africa

the swedish frigate which was to convey m skioldebrand to algiers
was expected at marseilles toward the end of october m bonpland
and myself repaired thither with great celerity for during our
journey we were tormented with the fear of being too late and
missing our passage

m skioldebrand was no less impatient than ourselves to reach his
place of destination several times a day we climbed the mountain
of notre dame de la garde which commands an extensive view of the
mediterranean every sail we descried in the horizon excited in us
the most eager emotion but after two months of anxiety and vain
expectation we learned by the public papers that the swedish
frigate which was to convey us had suffered greatly in a storm on
the coast of portugal and had been forced to enter the port of
cadiz to refit this news was confirmed by private letters
assuring us that the jaramas which was the name of the frigate
would not reach marseilles before the spring

we felt no inclination to prolong our stay in provence till that
period the country and especially the climate were delightful
but the aspect of the sea reminded us of the failure of our
projects in an excursion we made to hyeres and toulon we found in
the latter port the frigate la boudeuse which had been commanded
by m de bougainville in his voyage round the world she was then
fitting out for corsica m de bougainville had honoured me with
particular kindness during my stay in paris when i was preparing
to accompany the expedition of captain baudin i cannot describe
the impression made upon my mind by the sight of the vessel which
had carried commerson to the islands of the south sea in some
conditions of the mind a painful emotion blends itself with all
our feelings

we still persisted in the intention of visiting the african coast
and were nearly becoming the victims of our perseverance a small
vessel of ragusa on the point of setting sail for tunis was at
that time in the port of marseilles we thought the opportunity
favourable for reaching egypt and syria and we agreed with the
captain for our passage the vessel was to sail the following day
but a circumstance trivial in itself happily prevented our
departure the live-stock intended to serve us for food during our
passage was kept in the great cabin we desired that some changes
should be made which were indispensable for the safety of our
instruments and during this interval we learnt at marseilles that
the government of tunis persecuted the french residing in barbary
and that every person coming from a french port was thrown into a
dungeon having escaped this imminent danger we were compelled to
suspend the execution of our projects we resolved to pass the
winter in spain in hopes of embarking the next spring either at
carthagena or at cadiz if the political situation of the east
permitted

we crossed catalonia and the kingdom of valencia on our way to
madrid we visited the ruins of tarragona and those of ancient
saguntum and from barcelona we made an excursion to montserrat
the lofty peaks of which are inhabited by hermits and where the
contrast between luxuriant vegetation and masses of naked and arid
rocks forms a landscape of a peculiar character i employed myself
in ascertaining by astronomical observations the position of
several points important for the geography of spain and determined
by means of the barometer the height of the central plain i
likewise made several observations on the inclination of the
needle and on the intensity of the magnetic forces

on my arrival at madrid i had reason to congratulate myself on the
resolution i had formed of visiting the peninsula baron de forell
minister from the court of saxony treated me with a degree of
kindness of which i soon felt the value he was well versed in
mineralogy and was full of zeal for every undertaking that
promoted the progress of knowledge he observed to me that under
the administration of an enlightened minister don mariano luis de
urquijo i might hope to obtain permission to visit at my own
expense the interior of spanish america after the disappointments
i had suffered i did not hesitate a moment to adopt this idea

i was presented at the court of aranjuez in march 1799 and the king
received me graciously i explained to him the motives which led me
to undertake a voyage to the new world and the philippine islands
and i presented a memoir on the subject to the secretary of state
senor de urquijo supported my demand and overcame every obstacle
i obtained two passports one from the first secretary of state
the other from the council of the indies never had so extensive a
permission been granted to any traveller and never had any
foreigner been honoured with more confidence on the part of the
spanish government

many considerations might have induced us to prolong our abode in
spain the abbe cavanilles no less remarkable for the variety of
his attainments than his acute intelligence m nee who together
with m haenke had as botanist made part of the expedition of
malaspina and who had formed one of the greatest herbals ever seen
in europe don casimir ortega the abbe pourret and the learned
authors of the flora of peru messrs ruiz and pavon all opened to
us without reserve their rich collections we examined part of the
plants of mexico discovered by messrs sesse mocino and
cervantes whose drawings had been sent to the museum of natural
history of madrid this great establishment the direction of which
was confided to senor clavijo author of an elegant translation of
the works of buffon offered us it is true no geological
representation of the cordilleras but m proust so well known by
the great accuracy of his chemical labours and a distinguished
mineralogist m hergen gave us curious details on several mineral
substances of america it would have been useful to us to have
employed a longer time in studying the productions of the countries
which were to be the objects of our research but our impatience to
take advantage of the permission given us by the court was too
great to suffer us to delay our departure for a year past i had
experienced so many disappointments that i could scarcely persuade
myself that my most ardent wishes would be at length fulfilled

we left madrid about the middle of may crossed a part of old
castile the kingdoms of leon and galicia and reached corunna
whence we were to embark for cuba the winter having been
protracted and severe we enjoyed during the journey that mild
temperature of the spring which in so southern a latitude usually
occurs during march and april the snow still covered the lofty
granitic tops of the guadarama but in the deep valleys of galicia
which resemble the most picturesque spots of switzerland and the
tyrol cistuses loaded with flowers and arborescent heaths clothed
every rock we quitted without regret the elevated plain of the two
castiles which is everywhere devoid of vegetation and where the
severity of the winter's cold is followed by the overwhelming heat
of summer from the few observations i personally made the
interior of spain forms a vast plain elevated three hundred toises
(five hundred and eighty-four metres) above the level of the ocean
is covered with secondary formations grit-stone gypsum sal-gem
and the calcareous stone of jura the climate of the castiles is
much colder than that of toulon and genoa its mean temperature
scarcely rises to 15 degrees of the centigrade thermometer

we are astonished to find that in the latitude of calabria
thessaly and asia minor orange-trees do not flourish in the open
air the central elevated plain is encircled by a low and narrow
zone where the chamaerops the date-tree the sugar-cane the
banana and a number of plants common to spain and the north of
africa vegetate on several spots without suffering from the
rigours of winter from the 36th to 40th degrees of latitude the
medium temperature of this zone is from 17 to 20 degrees and by a
concurrence of circumstances which it would be too long to
explain this favoured region has become the principal seat of
industry and intellectual improvement

when in the kingdom of valencia we ascend from the shore of the
mediterranean towards the lofty plains of la mancha and the
castiles we seem to discern far inland from the lengthened
declivities the ancient coast of the peninsula this curious
phenomenon recalls the traditions of the samothracians and other
historical testimonies according to which it is supposed that the
irruption of the waters through the dardanelles augmenting the
basin of the mediterranean rent and overflowed the southern part
of europe if we admit that these traditions owe their origin not
to mere geological reveries but to the remembrance of some ancient
catastrophe we may conceive the central elevated plain of spain
resisting the efforts of these great inundations till the draining
of the waters by the straits formed between the pillars of
hercules brought the mediterranean progressively to its present
level lower egypt emerging above its surface on the one side and
the fertile plains of tarragona valencia and murcia on the
other everything that relates to the formation of that sea* (*
some of the ancient geographers believed that the mediterranean
swelled by the waters of the euxine the palus maeotis the caspian
sea and the sea of aral had broken the pillars of hercules
others admitted that the irruption was made by the waters of the
ocean in the first of these hypotheses the height of the land
between the black sea and the baltic and between the ports of
cette and bordeaux determine the limit which the accumulation of
the waters may have reached before the junction of the black sea
the mediterranean and the atlantic as well to the north of the
dardanelles as to the east of this strip of land which formerly
joined europe to mauritania and of which in the time of strabo
certain vestiges remained in the islands of juno and the moon)
which has had so powerful an influence on the first civilization of
mankind is highly interesting we might suppose that spain
forming a promontory amidst the waves was indebted for its
preservation to the height of its land but in order to give weight
to these theoretic ideas we must clear up the doubts that have
arisen respecting the rupture of so many transverse dikes we must
discuss the probability of the mediterranean having been formerly
divided into several separate basins of which sicily and the
island of candia appear to mark the ancient limits we will not
here risk the solution of these problems but will satisfy
ourselves in fixing attention on the striking contrast in the
configuration of the land in the eastern and western extremities of
europe between the baltic and the black sea the ground is at
present scarcely fifty toises above the level of the ocean while
the plain of la mancha if placed between the sources of the niemen
and the borysthenes would figure as a group of mountains of
considerable height if the causes which may have changed the
surface of our planet be an interesting speculation
investigations of the phenomena such as they offer themselves to
the measures and observations of the naturalist lead to far
greater certainty

from astorga to corunna especially from lugo the mountains rise
gradually the secondary formations gently disappear and are
succeeded by the transition rocks which indicate the proximity of
primitive strata we found considerable mountains composed of that
ancient grey stone which the mineralogists of the school of
freyberg name grauwakke and grauwakkenschiefer i do not know
whether this formation which is not frequent in the south of
europe has hitherto been discovered in other parts of spain
angular fragments of lydian stone scattered along the valleys
seemed to indicate that the transition schist is the basis of the
strata of greywacke near corunna even granitic ridges stretch as
far as cape ortegal these granites which seem formerly to have
been contiguous to those of britanny and cornwall are perhaps the
wrecks of a chain of mountains destroyed and sunk in the waves
large and beautiful crystals of feldspar characterise this rock
common tin ore is sometimes discovered there but working the mines
is a laborious and unprofitable operation for the inhabitants of
galicia

the first secretary of state had recommended us very particularly
to brigadier don raphael clavijo who was employed in forming new
dock-yards at corunna he advised us to embark on board the sloop
pizarro* (* according to the spanish nomenclature the pizarro was
a light frigate (fragata lijera)) which was to sail in company
with the alcudia the packet-boat of the month of may which on
account of the blockade had been detained three weeks in the port
senor clavijo ordered the necessary arrangements to be made on
board the sloop for placing our instruments and the captain of the
pizarro received orders to stop at teneriffe as long as we should
judge necessary to enable us to visit the port of orotava and
ascend the peak

we had yet ten days to wait before we embarked during this
interval we employed ourselves in preparing the plants we had
collected in the beautiful valleys of galicia which no naturalist
had yet visited we examined the fuci and the mollusca which the
north-west winds had cast with great profusion at the foot of the
steep rock on which the lighthouse of the tower of hercules is
built this edifice called also the iron tower was repaired in
1788 it is ninety-two feet high its walls are four feet and a
half thick and its construction clearly proves that it was built
by the romans an inscription discovered near its foundation a
copy of which m laborde obligingly gave me informs us that this
pharos was constructed by caius sevius lupus architect of the city
of aqua flavia (chaves) and that it was dedicated to mars why is
the iron tower called in the country by the name of hercules? was
it built by the romans on the ruins of a greek or phoenician
edifice? strabo indeed affirms that galicia the country of the
callaeci had been peopled by greek colonies according to an
extract from the geography of spain by asclepiades the myrlaean
an ancient tradition stated that the companions of hercules had
settled in these countries

the ports of ferrol and corunna both communicate with one bay so
that a vessel driven by bad weather towards the coast may anchor in
either according to the wind this advantage is invaluable where
the sea is almost always tempestuous as between capes ortegal and
finisterre which are the promontories trileucum and artabrum of
ancient geography a narrow passage flanked by perpendicular rocks
of granite leads to the extensive basin of ferrol no port in
europe has so extraordinary an anchorage from its very inland
position the narrow and tortuous passage by which vessels enter
this port has been opened either by the irruption of the waves
or by the reiterated shocks of very violent earthquakes in the new
world on the coasts of new andalusia the laguna del obispo
(bishop's lake) is formed exactly like the port of ferrol the most
curious geological phenomena are often repeated at immense
distances on the surface of continents and naturalists who have
examined different parts of the globe are struck with the extreme
resemblance observed in the rents on coasts in the sinuosities of
the valleys in the aspect of the mountains and in their
distribution by groups the accidental concurrence of the same
causes must have everywhere produced the same effects and amidst
the variety of nature an analogy of structure and form is observed
in the arrangement of inanimate matter as well as in the internal
organization of plants and of animals

crossing from corunna to ferrol over a shallow near the white
signal in the bay which according to d'anville is the portus
magnus of the ancients we made several experiments by means of a
valved thermometrical sounding lead on the temperature of the
ocean and on the decrement of caloric in the successive strata of
water the thermometer on the bank and near the surface was from
125 to 133 degrees centigrades while in deep water it constantly
marked 15 or 153 degrees the air being at 128 degrees the
celebrated franklin and mr jonathan williams* (* author of a work
entitled "thermometrical navigation" published at philadelphia)
were the first to invite the attention of naturalists to the
phenomena of the temperature of the atlantic over shoals and in
that zone of tepid and flowing waters which runs from the gulf of
mexico to the banks of newfoundland and the northern coasts of
europe the observation that the proximity of a sand-bank is
indicated by a rapid descent of the temperature of the sea at its
surface is not only interesting to the naturalist but may become
also very important for the safety of navigators the use of the
thermometer ought certainly not to lead us to neglect the use of
the lead but experiments sufficiently prove that variations of
temperature sensible to the most imperfect instruments indicate
danger long before the vessel reaches the shoals in such cases
the frigidity of the water may induce the pilot to heave the lead
in places where he thought himself in the most perfect safety the
waters which cover the shoals owe in a great measure the diminution
of their temperature to their mixture with the lower strata of
water which rise towards the surface on the edge of the banks

the moment of leaving europe for the first time is attended with a
solemn feeling we in vain summon to our minds the frequency of the
communication between the two worlds we in vain reflect on the
great facility with which from the improved state of navigation
we traverse the atlantic which compared to the pacific is but a
larger arm of the sea the sentiment we feel when we first
undertake so distant a voyage is not the less accompanied by a deep
emotion unlike any other impression we have hitherto felt
separated from the objects of our dearest affections entering in
some sort on a new state of existence we are forced to fall back
on our own thoughts and we feel within ourselves a dreariness we
have never known before among the letters which at the time of
our embarking i wrote to friends in france and germany one had a
considerable influence on the direction of our travels and on our
succeeding operations when i left paris with the intention of
visiting the coast of africa the expedition for discoveries in the
pacific seemed to be adjourned for several years i had agreed with
captain baudin that if contrary to his expectation his voyage
took place at an earlier period and intelligence of it should
reach me in time i would endeavour to return from algiers to a
port in france or spain to join the expedition i renewed this
promise on leaving europe and wrote to m baudin that if the
government persisted in sending him by cape horn i would endeavour
to meet him either at monte video chile or lima or wherever he
should touch in the spanish colonies in consequence of this
engagement i changed the plan of my journey on reading in the
american papers in 1801 that the french expedition had sailed
from havre to circumnavigate the globe from east to west i hired
a small vessel from batabano in the island of cuba to portobello
and thence crossed the isthmus to the coast of the pacific this
mistake of a journalist led m bonpland and myself to travel eight
hundred leagues through a country we had no intention to visit it
was only at quito that a letter from m delambre perpetual
secretary of the first class of the institute informed us that
captain baudin went by the cape of good hope without touching on
the eastern or western coasts of america

we spent two days at corunna after our instruments were embarked
a thick fog which covered the horizon at length indicated the
change of weather we so anxiously desired on the 4th of june in
the evening the wind turned to north-east a point which on the
coast of galicia is considered very constant during the summer
the pizarro prepared to sail on the 5th though we had intelligence
that only a few hours previously an english squadron had been seen
from the watch-tower of sisarga appearing to stand towards the
mouth of the tagus those who saw our ship weigh anchor asserted
that we should be captured in three days and that forced to
follow the fate of the vessel we should be carried to lisbon this
prognostic gave us the more uneasiness as we had known some
mexicans at madrid who in order to return to vera cruz had
embarked three times at cadiz and having been each time taken at
the entrance of the port were at length obliged to return to spain
through portugal

the pizarro set sail at two in the afternoon as the long and
narrow passage by which a ship sails from the port of corunna opens
towards the north and the wind was contrary we made eight short
tacks three of which were useless a fresh tack was made but very
slowly and we were for some moments in danger at the foot of fort
st amarro the current having driven us very near the rock on
which the sea breaks with considerable violence we remained with
our eyes fixed on the castle of st antonio where the unfortunate
malaspina was then a captive in a state prison on the point of
leaving europe to visit the countries which this illustrious
traveller had visited with so much advantage i could have wished
to have fixed my thoughts on some object less affecting

at half-past six we passed the tower of hercules which is the
lighthouse of corunna as already mentioned and where from a very
remote time a coal-fire has been kept up for the direction of
vessels the light of this fire is in no way proportionate to the
noble construction of so vast an edifice being so feeble that
ships cannot perceive it till they are in danger of striking on the
shore towards the close of day the wind increased and the sea ran
high we directed our course to north-west in order to avoid the
english frigates which we supposed were cruising off these coasts
about nine we spied the light of a fishing-hut at sisarga which
was the last object we beheld in the west of europe

on the 7th we were in the latitude of cape finisterre the group of
granitic rocks which forms part of this promontory like that of
torianes and monte de corcubion bears the name of the sierra de
torinona cape finisterre is lower than the neighbouring lands but
the torinona is visible at seventeen leagues' distance which
proves that the elevation of its highest summit is not less than
300 toises (582 metres) spanish navigators affirm that on these
coasts the magnetic variation differs extremely from that observed
at sea m bory it is true in the voyage of the sloop amaranth
found in 1751 that the variation of the needle determined at the
cape was four degrees less than could have been conjectured from
the observations made at the same period along the coasts in the
same manner as the granite of galicia contains tin disseminated in
its mass that of cape finisterre probably contains micaceous iron
in the mountains of the upper palatinate there are granitic rocks
in which crystals of micaceous iron take the place of common mica

on the 8th at sunset we descried from the mast-head an english
convoy sailing along the coast and steering towards south-east in
order to avoid it we altered our course during the night from this
moment no light was permitted in the great cabin to prevent our
being seen at a distance this precaution which was at the time
prescribed in the regulations of the packet-ships of the spanish
navy was extremely irksome to us during the voyages we made in the
course of the five following years we were constantly obliged to
make use of dark-lanterns to examine the temperature of the water
or to read the divisions on the limb of the astronomical
instruments in the torrid zone where twilight lasts but a few
minutes our operations ceased almost at six in the evening this
state of things was so much the more vexatious to me as from the
nature of my constitution i never was subject to sea-sickness and
feel an extreme ardour for study during the whole time i am at sea

on the 9th of june in latitude 39 degrees 50 minutes and
longitude 16 degrees 10 minutes west of the meridian of the
observatory of paris we began to feel the effects of the great
current which from the azores flows towards the straits of
gibraltar and the canary islands this current is commonly
attributed to that tendency towards the east which the straits of
gibraltar give to the waters of the atlantic ocean m de fleurieu
observes that the mediterranean losing by evaporation more water
than the rivers can supply causes a movement in the neighbouring
ocean and that the influence of the straits is felt at the
distance of six hundred leagues without derogating from the
respect i entertain for the opinion of that celebrated navigator i
may be permitted to consider this important object in a far more
general point of view

when we cast our eyes over the atlantic or that deep valley which
divides the western coasts of europe and africa from the eastern
coasts of the new world we distinguish a contrary direction in the
motion of the waters within the tropics especially from the coast
of senegal to the caribbean sea the general current that which
was earliest known to mariners flows constantly from east to west
this is called the equinoctial current its mean rapidity
corresponding to different latitudes is nearly the same in the
atlantic and in the pacific and may be estimated at nine or ten
miles in twenty-four hours consequently from 059 to 065 of a
foot every second in those latitudes the waters run towards the
west with a velocity equal to a fourth of the rapidity of the
greater part of the larger rivers of europe the movement of the
ocean in a direction contrary to that of the rotation of the globe
is probably connected with this last phenomenon only as far as the
rotation converts into trade winds* (* the limits of the trade
winds were for the first time determined by dampier in 1666) the
polar winds which in the low regions of the atmosphere bring back
the cold air of the high latitudes toward the equator to the
general impulsion which these trade-winds give the surface of the
sea we must attribute the equinoctial current the force and
rapidity of which are not sensibly modified by the local variations
of the atmosphere

in the channel which the atlantic has dug between guiana and
guinea on the meridian of 20 or 23 degrees and from the 8th or
9th to the 2nd or 3rd degrees of northern latitude where the
trade-winds are often interrupted by winds blowing from the south
and south-south-west the equinoctial current is more inconstant in
its direction towards the coasts of africa vessels are drawn in
the direction of south-east whilst towards the bay of all saints
and cape st augustin the coasts of which are dreaded by
navigators sailing towards the mouth of the plata the general
motion of the waters is masked by a particular current (the effects
of which extend from cape st roche to the isle of trinidad)
running north-west with a mean velocity of a foot and a half every
second

the equinoctial current is felt though feebly even beyond the
tropic of cancer in the 26th and 28th degrees of latitude in the
vast basin of the atlantic at six or seven hundred leagues from
the coasts of africa vessels from europe bound to the west indies
find their sailing accelerated before they reach the torrid zone
more to the north in 28 and 35 degrees between the parallels of
teneriffe and ceuta in 46 and 48 degrees of longitude no constant
motion is observed there a zone of 140 leagues in breadth
separates the equinoctial current (the tendency of which is towards
the west) from that great mass of water which runs eastward and is
distinguished for its extraordinary high temperature to this mass
of waters known by the name of the gulf-stream* (* sir francis
drake observed this extraordinary movement of the waters but he
was unacquainted with their high temperature) the attention of
naturalists was directed in 1776 by the curious observations of
franklin and sir charles blagden

the equinoctial current drives the waters of the atlantic towards
the coasts inhabited by the mosquito indians and towards the
shores of honduras the new continent stretching from south to
north forms a sort of dyke to this current the waters are carried
at first north-west and passing into the gulf of mexico through
the strait formed by cape catoche and cape st antonio follow the
bendings of the mexican coast from vera cruz to the mouth of the
rio del norte and thence to the mouths of the mississippi and the
shoals west of the southern extremity of florida having made this
vast circuit west north east and south the current takes a new
direction northward and throws itself with impetuosity into the
gulf of florida at the end of the gulf of florida in the parallel
of cape cannaveral the gulf-stream or current of florida runs
north-east its rapidity resembles that of a torrent and is
sometimes five miles an hour the pilot may judge with some
certainty of the proximity of his approach to new york
philadelphia or charlestown when he reaches the edge of the
stream for the elevated temperature of the waters their saltness
indigo-blue colour and the shoals of seaweed which cover their
surface as well as the heat of the surrounding atmosphere all
indicate the gulf-stream its rapidity diminishes towards the
north at the same time that its breadth increases and the waters
become cool between cayo biscaino and the bank of bahama the
breadth is only 15 leagues whilst in the latitude of 28 1/2
degrees it is 17 and in the parallel of charlestown opposite
cape henlopen from 40 to 50 leagues the rapidity of the current
is from three to five miles an hour where the stream is narrowest
and is only one mile as it advances towards the north the waters
of the mexican gulf forcibly drawn to north-east preserve their
warm temperature to such a point that in 40 and 41 degrees of
latitude i found them at 225 degrees (18 degrees r) when out of
the current the heat of the ocean at its surface was scarcely 175
degrees (14 degrees r) in the parallel of new york and oporto
the temperature of the gulf-stream is consequently equal to that of
the seas of the tropics in the 18th degree of latitude as for
instance in the parallel of porto rico and the islands of cape
verd

to the east of the port of boston and on the meridian of halifax
in latitude 41 degrees 25 minutes and longitude 67 degrees the
current is near 80 leagues broad from this point it turns suddenly
to the east so that its western edge as it bends becomes the
western limit of the running waters skirting the extremity of the
great bank of newfoundland which m volney ingeniously calls the
bar of the mouth of this enormous sea-river the cold waters of
this bank which according to my experiments are at a temperature
of 87 or 10 degrees (7 or 8 degrees r) present a striking
contrast with the waters of the torrid zone driven northward by
the gulf-stream the temperature of which is from 21 to 225
degrees (17 to 18 degrees r) in these latitudes the caloric is
distributed in a singular manner throughout the ocean the waters
of the bank are 94 degrees colder than the neighbouring sea and
this sea is 3 degrees colder than the current these zones can have
no equilibrium of temperature having a source of heat or a cause
of refrigeration which is peculiar to each and the influence of
which is permanent

from the bank of newfoundland or from the 52nd degree of longitude
to the azores the gulf-stream continues its course to east and
east-south-east the waters are still acted upon by the impulsion
they received near a thousand leagues distance in the straits of
florida between the island of cuba and the shoals of tortoise
island this distance is double the length of the course of the
river amazon from jaen or the straits of manseriche to grand para
on the meridian of the islands of corvo and flores the most
western of the group of the azores the breadth of the current is
160 leagues when vessels on their return from south america to
europe endeavour to make these two islands to rectify their
longitude they are always sensible of the motion of the waters to
south-east at the 33rd degree of latitude the equinoctial current
of the tropics is in the near vicinity of the gulf-stream in this
part of the ocean we may in a single day pass from waters that
flow towards the west into those which run to the south-east or
east-south-east

from the azores the current of florida turns towards the straits
of gibraltar the isle of madeira and the group of the canary
islands the opening of the pillars of hercules has no doubt
accelerated the motion of the waters towards the east we may in
this point of view assert that the strait by which the
mediterranean communicates with the atlantic produces its effects
at a great distance but it is probable also that without the
existence of this strait vessels sailing to teneriffe would be
driven south-east by a cause which we must seek on the coasts of
the new world every motion is the cause of another motion in the
vast basin of the seas as well as in the aerial ocean tracing the
currents to their most distant sources and reflecting on their
variable celerity sometimes decreasing as between the gulf of
florida and the bank of newfoundland at other times augmenting as
in the neighbourhood of the straits of gibraltar and near the
canary islands we cannot doubt but the same cause which impels the
waters to make the circuitous sweep of the gulf of mexico agitates
them also near the island of madeira

on the south of that island we may follow the current in its
direction south-east and south-south-east towards the coast of
africa between cape cantin and cape bojador in those latitudes a
vessel becalmed is running on the coast while according to the
uncorrected reckoning it was supposed to be a good distance out at
sea were the motion of the waters caused by the opening at the
straits of gibraltar why on the south of those straits should it
not follow an opposite direction? on the contrary in the 25th and
26th degrees of latitude the current flows at first direct south
and then south-west cape blanc which after cape verd is the
most salient promontory seems to have an influence on this
direction and in this parallel the waters of which we have
followed the course from the coasts of honduras to those of africa
mingle with the great current of the tropics to resume their tour
from east to west several hundred leagues westward of the canary
islands the motion peculiar to the equinoctial waters is felt in
the temperate zone from the 28th and 29th degrees of north
latitude but on the meridian of the island of ferro vessels sail
southward as far as the tropic of cancer before they find
themselves by their reckoning eastward of their right course* (*
see humboldt's cosmos volume 1 page 312 bohn's edition)

we have just seen that between the parallels of 11 and 43 degrees
the waters of the atlantic are driven by the currents in a
continual whirlpool supposing that a molecule of water returns to
the same place from which it departed we can estimate from our
present knowledge of the swiftness of currents that this circuit
of 3800 leagues is not terminated in less than two years and ten
months a boat which may be supposed to receive no impulsion from
the winds would require thirteen months to go from the canary
islands to the coast of caracas ten months to make the tour of the
gulf of mexico and reach tortoise shoals opposite the port of the
havannah while forty or fifty days might be sufficient to carry it
from the straits of florida to the bank of newfoundland it would
be difficult to fix the rapidity of the retrograde current from
this bank to the shores of africa estimating the mean velocity of
the waters at seven or eight miles in twenty-four hours we may
allow ten or eleven months for this last distance such are the
effects of the slow but regular motion which agitates the waters of
the atlantic those of the river amazon take nearly forty-five days
to flow from tomependa to grand para

a short time before my arrival at teneriffe the sea had left in
the road of santa cruz the trunk of a cedrela odorata covered with
the bark this american tree vegetates within the tropics or in
the neighbouring regions it had no doubt been torn up on the coast
of the continent or of that of honduras the nature of the wood
and the lichens which covered its bark bore evidence that this
trunk had not belonged to these submarine forests which ancient
revolutions of the globe have deposited in the polar regions if
the cedrela instead of having been cast on the strand of
teneriffe had been carried farther south it would probably have
made the whole tour of the atlantic and returned to its native
soil with the general current of the tropics this conjecture is
supported by a fact of more ancient date recorded in the history
of the canaries by the abbe viera in 1770 a small vessel laden
with corn and bound from the island of lancerota to santa cruz
in teneriffe was driven out to sea while none of the crew were on
board the motion of the waters from east to west carried it to
america where it went on shore at la guayra near caracas

whilst the art of navigation was yet in its infancy the
gulf-stream suggested to the mind of christopher columbus certain
indications of the existence of western regions two corpses the
features of which indicated a race of unknown men were cast ashore
on the azores towards the end of the 15th century nearly at the
same period the brother-in-law of columbus peter correa governor
of porto santo found on the strand of that island pieces of bamboo
of extraordinary size brought thither by the western currents the
dead bodies and the bamboos attracted the attention of the genoese
navigator who conjectured that both came from a continent situate
towards the west we now know that in the torrid zone the
trade-winds and the current of the tropics are in opposition to
every motion of the waves in the direction of the earth's rotation
the productions of the new world cannot reach the old but by the
very high latitudes and in following the direction of the current
of florida the fruits of several trees of the antilles are often
washed ashore on the coasts of the islands of ferro and gomera
before the discovery of america the canarians considered these
fruits as coming from the enchanted isle of st borondon which
according to the reveries of pilots and certain legends was
situated towards the west in an unknown part of the ocean buried
as was supposed in eternal mists

my chief view in tracing a sketch of the currents of the atlantic
is to prove that the motion of the waters towards the south-east
from cape st vincent to the canary islands is the effect of the
general motion to which the surface of the ocean is subjected at
its western extremity we shall give but a very succinct account of
the arm of the gulf-stream which in the 45th and 50th degrees of
latitude near the bank called the bonnet flamand runs from
south-west to north-east towards the coasts of europe this partial
current becomes very strong at those times when the west winds are
of long continuance and like that which flows along the isles of
ferro and gomera it deposits every year on the western coasts of
ireland and norway the fruit of trees which belong to the torrid
zone of america on the shores of the hebrides we collect seeds of
mimosa scandens of dolichos urens of guilandina bonduc and
several other plants of jamaica the isle of cuba and of the
neighbouring continent the current carries thither also barrels of
french wine well preserved the remains of the cargoes of vessels
wrecked in the west indian seas to these examples of the distant
migration of the vegetable world others no less striking may be
added the wreck of an english vessel the tilbury burnt near
jamaica was found on the coast of scotland on these same coasts
are sometimes found various kinds of tortoises that inhabit the
waters of the antilles when the western winds are of long
duration a current is formed in the high latitudes which runs
directly towards east-south-east from the coasts of greenland and
labrador as far as the north of scotland wallace relates that
twice (in 1682 and 1684) american savages of the race of the
esquimaux driven out to sea in their leathern canoes during a
storm and left to the guidance of the currents reached the
orkneys this last example is the more worthy of attention as it
proves at the same time how at a period when the art of navigation
was yet in its infancy the motion of the waters of the ocean may
have contributed to disseminate the different races of men over the
face of the globe

in reflecting on the causes of the atlantic currents we find that
they are much more numerous than is generally believed for the
waters of the sea may be put in motion by an external impulse by
difference of heat and saltness by the periodical melting of the
polar ice or by the inequality of evaporation in different
latitudes sometimes several of these causes concur to one and the
same effect and sometimes they produce several contrary effects
winds that are light but which like the trade-winds are
continually acting on the whole of a zone cause a real movement of
transition which we do not observe in the heaviest tempests
because these last are circumscribed within a small space when in
a great mass of water the particles at the surface acquire a
different specific gravity a superficial current is formed which
takes its direction towards the point where the water is coldest
or where it is most saturated with muriate of soda sulphate of
lime and muriate or sulphate of magnesia in the seas of the
tropics we find that at great depths the thermometer marks 7 or 8
centesimal degrees such is the result of the numerous experiments
of commodore ellis and of m peron the temperature of the air in
those latitudes being never below 19 or 20 degrees it is not at
the surface that the waters can have acquired a degree of cold so
near the point of congelation and of the maximum of the density of
water the existence of this cold stratum in the low latitudes is
an evident proof of the existence of an under-current which runs
from the poles towards the equator it also proves that the saline
substances which alter the specific gravity of the water are
distributed in the ocean so as not to annihilate the effect
produced by the differences of temperature

considering the velocity of the molecules which on account of the
rotatory motion of the globe vary with the parallels we may be
tempted to admit that every current in the direction from south to
north tends at the same time eastward while the waters which run
from the pole towards the equator have a tendency to deviate
westward we may also be led to think that these tendencies
diminish to a certain point the speed of the tropical current in
the same manner as they change the direction of the polar current
which in july and august is regularly perceived during the melting
of the ice on the parallel of the bank of newfoundland and
farther north very old nautical observations which i have had
occasion to confirm by comparing the longitude given by the
chronometer with that which the pilots obtained by their reckoning
are however contrary to these theoretical ideas in both
hemispheres the polar currents when they are perceived decline a
little to the east and it would seem that the cause of this
phenomenon should be sought in the constancy of the westerly winds
which prevail in the high latitudes besides the particles of
water do not move with the same rapidity as the particles of air
and the currents of the ocean which we consider as most rapid
have only a swiftness of eight or nine feet a second it is
consequently very probable that the water in passing through
different parallels gradually acquires a velocity correspondent to
those parallels and that the rotation of the earth does not change
the direction of the currents

the variable pressure on the surface of the sea caused by the
changes in the weight of the air is another cause of motion which
deserves particular attention it is well known that the
barometric variations do not in general take place at the same
moment in two distant points which are on the same level if in
one of these points the barometer stands a few lines lower than in
the other the water will rise where it finds the least pressure of
air and this local intumescence will continue till from the
effect of the wind the equilibrium of the air is restored m
vaucher thinks that the tides in the lake of geneva known by the
name of the seiches arise from the same cause we know not whether
it be the same when the movement of progression which must not be
confounded with the oscillation of the waves is the effect of an
external impulse m de fleurieu in his narrative of the voyage of
the isis cites several facts which render it probable that the
sea is not so still at the bottom as naturalists generally suppose
without entering here into a discussion of this question we shall
only observe that if the external impulse is constant in its
action like that of the trade-winds the friction of the particles
of water on each other must necessarily propagate the motion of the
surface of the ocean even to the lower strata and in fact this
propagation in the gulf-stream has long been admitted by
navigators who think they discover the effects in the great depth
of the sea wherever it is traversed by the current of florida even
amidst the sand-banks which surround the northern coasts of the
united states this immense river of hot waters after a course of
fifty days from the 24th to the 45th degree of latitude or 450
leagues does not lose amidst the rigours of winter in the
temperate zone more than 3 or 4 degrees of the temperature it had
under the tropics the greatness of the mass and the small
conductibility of water for heat prevent a more speedy
refrigeration if therefore the gulf-stream has dug a channel at
the bottom of the atlantic ocean and if its waters are in motion
to considerable depths they must also in their inferior strata
keep up a lower temperature than that observed in the same
parallel in a part of the sea which has neither currents nor deep
shoals these questions can be cleared up only by direct
experiments made by thermometrical soundings

sir erasmus gower remarks that in the passage from england to the
canary islands the current which carries vessels towards the
south-east begins at the 39th degree of latitude during our
voyage from corunna to the coast of south america the effect of
this motion of the waters was perceived farther north from the
37th to the 30th degree the deviation was very unequal the daily
average effect was 12 miles that is our sloop drove towards the
east 75 miles in six days in crossing the parallel of the straits
of gibraltar at a distance of 140 leagues we had occasion to
observe that in those latitudes the maximum of the rapidity does
not correspond with the mouth of the straits but with a more
northerly point which lies on the prolongation of a line passing
through the strait and cape st vincent this line is parallel to
the direction which the waters follow from the azores to cape
cantin we should moreover observe (and this fact is not
uninteresting to those who examine the nature of fluids) that in
this part of the retrograde current on a breadth of 120 or 140
leagues the whole mass of water has not the same rapidity nor
does it follow precisely the same direction when the sea is
perfectly calm there appears at the surface narrow stripes like
small rivulets in which the waters run with a murmur very sensible
to the ear of an experienced pilot on the 13th of june in 34
degrees 36 minutes north latitude we found ourselves in the midst
of a great number of these beds of currents we took their
direction with the compass and some ran north-east others
east-north-east though the general movement of the ocean
indicated by comparing the reckoning with the chronometrical
longitude continued to be south-east it is very common to see a
mass of motionless waters crossed by threads of water which run in
different directions and we may daily observe this phenomenon on
the surface of lakes but it is much less frequent to find partial
movements impressed by local causes on small portions of waters in
the midst of an oceanic river which occupies an immense space and
which moves though slowly in a constant direction in the
conflict of currents as in the oscillation of the waves our
imagination is struck by those movements which seem to penetrate
each other and by which the ocean is continually agitated

we passed cape st vincent which is of basaltic formation at the
distance of more than eighty leagues it is not distinctly seen at
a greater distance than 15 leagues but the granitic mountain
called the foya de monchique situated near the cape is
perceptible as pilots allege at the distance of 26 leagues if
this assertion be exact the foya is 700 toises (1363 metres) and
consequently 116 toises (225 metres) higher than vesuvius

from corunna to the 36th degree of latitude we had scarcely seen
any organic being excepting sea-swallows and a few dolphins we
looked in vain for sea-weeds (fuci) and mollusca when on the 11th
of june we were struck with a curious sight which afterwards was
frequently renewed in the southern ocean we entered on a zone
where the whole sea was covered with a prodigious quantity of
medusas the vessel was almost becalmed but the mollusca were
borne towards the south-east with a rapidity four times greater
than the current their passage lasted near three quarters of an
hour we then perceived but a few scattered individuals following
the crowd at a distance as if tired with their journey do these
animals come from the bottom of the sea which is perhaps in these
latitudes some thousand fathoms deep? or do they make distant
voyages in shoals? we know that the mollusca haunt banks and if
the eight rocks near the surface which captain vobonne mentions
having seen in 1732 to the north of porto santo really exist we
may suppose that this innumerable quantity of medusas had been
thence detached for we were but 28 leagues from the reef we
found beside the medusa aurita of baster and the medusa pelagica
of bosc with eight tentacula (pelagia denticulata peron) a third
species which resembles the medusa hysocella and which vandelli
found at the mouth of the tagus it is known by its brownish-yellow
colour and by its tentacula which are longer than the body
several of these sea-nettles were four inches in diameter their
reflection was almost metallic their changeable colours of violet
and purple formed an agreeable contrast with the azure tint of the
ocean

in the midst of these medusas m bonpland observed bundles of
dagysa notata a mollusc of a singular construction which sir
joseph banks first discovered these are small gelatinous bags
transparent cylindrical sometimes polygonal thirteen lines long
and two or three in diameter these bags are open at both ends in
one of these openings we observed a hyaline bladder marked with a
yellow spot the cylinders lie longitudinally one against another
like the cells of a bee-hive and form chaplets from six to eight
inches in length i tried the galvanic electricity on these
mollusca but it produced no contraction it appears that the genus
dagysa formed at the time of cook's first voyage belongs to the
salpas (biphores of bruguiere) to which m cuvier joins the thalia
of brown and the tethys vagina of tilesius the salpas journey
also by groups joining in chaplets as we have observed of the
dagysa

on the morning of the 13th of june in 34 degrees 33 minutes
latitude we saw large masses of this last mollusc in its passage
the sea being perfectly calm we observed during the night that
of three species of medusas which we collected none yielded any
light but at the moment of a very slight shock this property does
not belong exclusively to the medusa noctiluca which forskael has
described in his fauna aegyptiaca and which gmelin has applied to
the medusa pelagica of loefling notwithstanding its red tentacula
and the brownish tuberosities of its body if we place a very
irritable medusa on a pewter plate and strike against the plate
with any sort of metal the slight vibrations of the plate are
sufficient to make this animal emit light sometimes in
galvanising the medusa the phosphorescence appears at the moment
that the chain closes though the exciters are not in immediate
contact with the organs of the animal the fingers with which we
touch it remain luminous for two or three minutes as is observed
in breaking the shell of the pholades if we rub wood with the body
of a medusa and the part rubbed ceases shining the
phosphorescence returns if we pass a dry hand over the wood when
the light is extinguished a second time it can no longer be
reproduced though the place rubbed be still humid and viscous in
what manner ought we to consider the effect of the friction or
that of the shock? this is a question of difficult solution is it
a slight augmentation of temperature which favours the
phosphorescence? or does the light return because the surface is
renewed by putting the animal parts proper to disengage the
phosphoric hydrogen in contact with the oxygen of the atmospheric
air? i have proved by experiments published in 1797 that the
shining of wood is extinguished in hydrogen gas and in pure azotic
gas and that its light reappears whenever we mix with it the
smallest bubble of oxygen gas these facts to which several others
may be added tend to explain the causes of the phosphorescence of
the sea and of that peculiar influence which the shock of the
waves exercises on the production of light

when we were between the island of madeira and the coast of africa
we had slight breezes and dead calms very favourable for the
magnetic observations which occupied me during this passage we
were never weary of admiring the beauty of the nights nothing can
be compared to the transparency and serenity of an african sky we
were struck with the innumerable quantity of falling stars which
appeared at every instant the farther progress we made towards the
south the more frequent was this phenomenon especially near the
canaries i have observed during my travels that these igneous
meteors are in general more common and luminous in some regions of
the globe than in others but i have never beheld them so
multiplied as in the vicinity of the volcanoes of the province of
quito and in that part of the pacific ocean which bathes the
volcanic coasts of guatimala the influence which place climate
and season appear to exercise on the falling stars distinguishes
this class of meteors from those to which we trace stones that drop
from the sky (aerolites) and which probably exist beyond the
boundaries of our atmosphere according to the observations of
messrs benzenberg and brandes many of the falling stars seen in
europe have been only thirty thousand toises high one was even
measured which did not exceed fourteen thousand toises or five
nautical leagues these measures which can give no result but by
approximation deserve well to be repeated in warm climates
especially within the tropics falling stars leave a tail behind
them which remains luminous 12 or 15 seconds at other times they
seem to burst into sparks and they are generally lower than those
in the north of europe we perceive them only in a serene and azure
sky they have perhaps never been below a cloud falling stars
often follow the same direction for several hours which direction
is that of the wind in the bay of naples m gay-lussac and myself
observed luminous phenomena very analogous to those which fixed my
attention during a long abode at mexico and quito these meteors
are perhaps modified by the nature of the soil and the air like
certain effects of the looming or mirage and of the terrestrial
refraction peculiar to the coasts of calabria and sicily

when we were forty leagues east of the island of madeira a
swallow* (* hirundo rustica linn) perched on the topsail-yard it
was so fatigued that it suffered itself to be easily taken it was
remarkable that a bird in that season and in calm weather should
fly so far in the expedition of d'entrecasteaux a common swallow
was seen 60 leagues distant from cape blanco but this was towards
the end of october and m labillardiere thought it had newly
arrived from europe we crossed these latitudes in june at a
period when the seas had not for a long time been agitated by
tempests i mention this last circumstance because small birds and
even butterflies are sometimes forced out to sea by the
impetuosity of the winds as we observed in the pacific ocean when
we were on the western coast of mexico

the pizarro had orders to touch at the isle of lancerota one of
the seven great canary islands and at five in the afternoon of the
16th of june that island appeared so distinctly in view that i was
able to take the angle of altitude of a conic mountain which
towered majestically over the other summits and which we thought
was the great volcano which had occasioned such devastation on the
night of the 1st of september 1730

the current drew us toward the coast more rapidly than we wished
as we advanced we discovered at first the island of forteventura
famous for its numerous camels* (* these camels which serve for
labour and sometimes for food did not exist till the bethencourts
made the conquest of the canaries in the sixteenth century asses
were so abundant in the island of forteventura that they became
wild and were hunted several thousands were killed to save the
harvest the horses of forteventura are of singular beauty and of
the barbary race "noticias de la historia general de las islas
canarias" por don jose de viera tome 2 page 436) and a short time
after we saw the small island of lobos in the channel which
separates forteventura from lancerota we spent part of the night
on deck the moon illumined the volcanic summits of lancerota the
flanks of which covered with ashes reflected a silver light
antares threw out its resplendent rays near the lunar disk which
was but a few degrees above the horizon the night was beautifully
serene and cool though we were but a little distance from the
african coast and on the limit of the torrid zone the centigrade
thermometer rose no higher than 18 degrees the phosphorescence of
the ocean seemed to augment the mass of light diffused through the
air after midnight great black clouds rising behind the volcano
shrouded at intervals the moon and the beautiful constellation of
the scorpion we beheld lights carried to and fro on shore which
were probably those of fishermen preparing for their labours we
had been occasionally employed during our passage in reading the
old voyages of the spaniards and these moving lights recalled to
our fancy those which pedro gutierrez page of queen isabella saw
in the isle of guanahani on the memorable night of the discovery
of the new world

on the 17th in the morning the horizon was foggy and the sky
slightly covered with vapour the outlines of the mountains of
lancerota appeared stronger the humidity increasing the
transparency of the air seemed at the same time to have brought
the objects nearer our view this phenomenon is well known to all
who have made hygrometrical observations in places whence the chain
of the higher alps or of the andes is seen we passed through the
channel which divides the isle of alegranza from montana clara
taking soundings the whole way and we examined the archipelago of
small islands situated northward of lancerota in the midst of this
archipelago which is seldom visited by vessels bound for
teneriffe we were singularly struck with the configuration of the
coasts we thought ourselves transported to the euganean mountains
in the vicentin or the banks of the rhine near bonn the form of
organized beings varies according to the climate and it is that
extreme variety which renders the study of the geography of plants
and animals so attractive but rocks more ancient perhaps than the
causes which have produced the difference of the climate on the
globe are the same in both hemispheres the porphyries containing
vitreous feldspar and hornblende the phonolite the greenstone
the amygdaloids and the basalt have forms almost as invariable as
simple crystallized substances in the canary islands and in the
mountains of auvergne in the mittelgebirge in bohemia in mexico
and on the banks of the ganges the formation of trap is indicated
by a symmetrical disposition of the mountains by truncated cones
sometimes insulated sometimes grouped and by elevated plains
both extremities of which are crowned by a conical rising

the whole western part of lancerota of which we had a near view
bears the appearance of a country recently convulsed by volcanic
eruptions everything is black parched and stripped of vegetable
mould we distinguished with our glasses stratified basalt in
thin and steeply-sloping strata several hills resembled the monte
novo near naples or those hillocks of scoria and ashes which the
opening earth threw up in a single night at the foot of the volcano
of jorullo in mexico in fact the abbe viera relates that in
1730 more than half the island changed its appearance the great
volcano which we have just mentioned and which the inhabitants
call the volcano of temanfaya spread desolation over a most
fertile and highly cultivated region nine villages were entirely
destroyed by the lavas this catastrophe had been preceded by a
tremendous earthquake and for several years shocks equally violent
were felt this last phenomenon is so much the more singular as it
seldom happens after an eruption when the elastic vapours have
found vent by the crater after the ejection of the melted matter
the summit of the great volcano is a rounded hill but not entirely
conic from the angles of altitude which i took at different
distances its absolute elevation did not appear to exceed three
hundred toises the neighbouring hills and those of alegranza and
isla clara were scarcely above one hundred or one hundred and
twenty toises we may be surprised at the small elevation of these
summits which viewed from the sea wear so majestic a form but
nothing is more uncertain than our judgment on the greatness of
angles which are subtended by objects close to the horizon from
illusions of this sort it arose that before the measures of
messrs de churruca and galleano at cape pilar navigators
considered the mountains of the straits of magellan and those of
terra del fuego to be extremely elevated

the island of lancerota bore formerly the name of titeroigotra on
the arrival of the spaniards its inhabitants were distinguished
from the other canarians by marks of greater civilization their
houses were built with freestone while the guanches of teneriffe
dwelt in caverns at lancerota a very singular custom prevailed at
that time of which we find no example except among the people of
thibet a woman had several husbands who alternately enjoyed the
prerogatives due to the head of a family a husband was considered
as such only during a lunar revolution and whilst his rights were
exercised by others he remained classed among the household
domestics in the fifteenth century the island of lancerota
contained two small distinct states divided by a wall a kind of
monument which outlives national enmities and which we find in
scotland in china and peru

we were forced by the winds to pass between the islands of
alegranza and montana clara and as none on board the sloop had
sailed through this passage we were obliged to be continually
sounding we found from twenty-five to thirty-two fathoms the lead
brought up an organic substance of so singular a structure that we
were for a long time doubtful whether it was a zoophyte or a kind
of seaweed the stem of a brownish colour and three inches long
has circular leaves with lobes and indented at the edges the
colour of these leaves is a pale green and they are membranous and
streaked like those of the adiantums and gingko biloba their
surface is covered with stiff whitish hairs before their opening
they are concave and enveloped one in the other we observed no
mark of spontaneous motion no sign of irritability not even on
the application of galvanic electricity the stem is not woody but
almost of a horny substance like the stem of the gorgons azote
and phosphorus having been abundantly found in several cryptogamous
plants an appeal to chemistry would be useless to determine
whether this organized substance belonged to the animal or
vegetable kingdom its great analogy to several sea-plants with
adiantum leaves especially the genus caulerpa of m lamoureux of
which the fucus proliter of forskael is one of the numerous
species engaged us to rank it provisionally among the sea-wracks
and give it the name of fucus vitifolius the bristles which cover
this plant are found in several other fuci* (* fucus
lycopodioides and f hirsutus) the leaf examined with a
microscope at the instant we drew it up from the water did not
present it is true those conglobate glands or those opaque
points which the parts of fructification in the genera of ulva and
fucus contain but how often do we find seaweeds in such a state
that we cannot yet distinguish any trace of seeds in their
transparent parenchyma

the vine-leaved fucus presents a physiological phenomenon of the
greatest interest fixed to a piece of madrepore this seaweed
vegetates at the bottom of the ocean at the depth of 192 feet
notwithstanding which we found its leaves as green as those of our
grasses according to the experiments of bouguer light is weakened
after a passage of 180 feet in the ratio of 1 to 14778 the
seaweed of alegranza consequently presents a new example of plants
which vegetate in great obscurity without becoming white several
germs enveloped in the bulbs of the lily tribes the embryo of the
malvaceae of the rhamnoides of the pistacea the viscum and the
citrus the branches of some subterraneous plants in short
vegetables transported into mines where the ambient air contains
hydrogen or a great quantity of azote become green without light
from these facts we are inclined to admit that it is not
exclusively by the influence of the solar rays that this carburet
of hydrogen is formed in the organs of plants the presence of
which makes the parenchyma appear of a lighter or darker green
according as the carbon predominates in the mixture

mr turner who has so well made known the family of the seaweeds
as well as many other celebrated botanists are of opinion that
most of the fuci which we gather on the surface of the ocean and
which from the 23rd to the 35th degree of latitude and 32nd of
longitude appear to the mariner like a vast inundated meadow grow
primitively at the bottom of the ocean and float only in their
ripened state when torn up by the motion of the waves if this
opinion be well founded we must agree that the family of seaweeds
offers formidable difficulties to naturalists who persist in
thinking that absence of light always produces whiteness for how
can we admit that so many species of ulvaceae and dictyoteae with
stems and green leaves which float on the ocean have vegetated on
rocks near the surface of the water?

from some notions which the captain of the pizarro had collected in
an old portuguese itinerary he thought himself opposite to a small
fort situated north of teguisa the capital of the island of
lancerota mistaking a rock of basalt for a castle he saluted it
by hoisting the spanish flag and sent a boat with an officer to
inquire of the commandant whether any english vessels were cruising
in the roads we were not a little surprised to learn that the land
which we had considered as a prolongation of the coast of
lancerota was the small island of graciosa and that for several
leagues there was not an inhabited place we took advantage of the
boat to survey the land which enclosed a large bay

the small part of the island of graciosa which we traversed
resembles those promontories of lava seen near naples between
portici and torre del greco the rocks are naked with no marks of
vegetation and scarcely any of vegetable soil a few crustaceous
lichen-like variolariae leprariae and urceorariae were scattered
about upon the basalts the lavas which are not covered with
volcanic ashes remain for ages without any appearance of
vegetation on the african soil excessive heat and lengthened
drought retard the growth of cryptogamous plants

the basalts of graciosa are not in columns but are divided into
strata ten or fifteen inches thick these strata are inclined at an
angle of 80 degrees to the north-west the compact basalt
alternates with the strata of porous basalt and marl the rock does
not contain hornblende but great crystals of foliated olivine
which have a triple cleavage* (* blaettriger olivin) this
substance is decomposed with great difficulty m hauy considers it
a variety of the pyroxene the porous basalt which passes into
mandelstein has oblong cavities from two to eight lines in
diameter lined with chalcedony enclosing fragments of compact
basalt i did not remark that these cavities had the same
direction or that the porous rock lay on compact strata as
happens in the currents of lava of etna and vesuvius the marl* (*
mergel) which alternates more than a hundred times with the
basalts is yellowish friable by decomposition very coherent in
the inside and often divided into irregular prisms analogous to
the basaltic prisms the sun discolours their surface as it
whitens several schists by reviving a hydro-carburetted principle
which appears to be combined with the earth the marl of graciosa
contains a great quantity of chalk and strongly effervesces with
nitric acid even on points where it is found in contact with the
basalt this fact is the more remarkable as this substance does
not fill the fissures of the rock but its strata are parallel to
those of the basalt whence we may conclude that both fossils are
of the same formation and have a common origin the phenomenon of
a basaltic rock containing masses of indurated marl split into
small columns is also found in the mittelgebirge in bohemia
visiting those countries in 1792 in company with mr freiesleben
we even recognized in the marl of the stiefelberg the imprint of a
plant nearly resembling the cerastium or the alsine are these
strata contained in the trappean mountains owing to muddy
irruptions or must we consider them as sediments of water which
alternate with volcanic deposits? this last hypothesis seems so
much the less admissible since from the researches of sir james
hall on the influence of pressure in fusions the existence of
carbonic acid in substances contained in basalt presents nothing
surprising several lavas of vesuvius present similar phenomena in
lombardy between vicenza and albano where the calcareous stone of
the jura contains great masses of basalt i have seen the latter
enter into effervescence with the acids wherever it touches the
calcareous rock

we had not time to reach the summit of a hill very remarkable for
having its base formed of banks of clay under strata of basalt
like a mountain in saxony called the scheibenbergen hugel which
is become celebrated on account of the disputes of volcanean and
neptunean geologists these basalts were covered with a mammiform
substance which i vainly sought on the peak of teneriffe and
which is known by the names of volcanic glass glass of muller or
hyalite it is the transition from the opal to the chalcedony we
struck off with difficulty some fine specimens leaving masses that
were eight or ten inches square untouched i never saw in europe
such fine hyalites as i found in the island of graciosa and on the
rock of porphyry called el penol de los banos on the bank of the
lake of mexico

two kinds of sand cover the shore one is black and basaltic the
other white and quartzose in a place exposed to the rays of the
sun the first raised the thermometer to 512 degrees (41 degrees
r) and the second to 40 degrees (32 degrees r) the temperature of
the air in the shade was 277 or 75 degrees higher than that of
the air over the sea the quartzose sand contains fragments of
feldspar it is thrown back by the water and forms in some sort
on the surface of the rocks small islets on which seaweed
vegetates fragments of granite have been observed at teneriffe
the island of gomora from the details furnished me by m
broussonnet contains a nucleus of micaceous schist the quartz
disseminated in the sand which we found on the shore of graciosa
is a different substance from the lavas and the trappean porphyries
so intimately connected with volcanic productions from these facts
it seems to be evident that in the canary islands as well as on
the andes of quito in auvergne in greece and throughout the
greater part of the globe subterraneous fires have pierced through
the rocks of primitive formation in treating hereafter of the
great number of warm springs which we have seen issuing from
granite gneiss and micaceous schist we shall have occasion to
return to this subject which is one of the most important of the
physical history of the globe

we re-embarked at sunset and hoisted sail but the breeze was too
feeble to permit us to continue our course to teneriffe the sea
was calm a reddish vapour covered the horizon and seemed to
magnify every object in this solitude amidst so many uninhabited
islets we enjoyed for a long time the view of rugged and wild
scenery the black mountains of graciosa appeared like
perpendicular walls five or six hundred feet high their shadows
thrown over the surface of the ocean gave a gloomy aspect to the
scenery rocks of basalt emerging from the bosom of the waters
wore the resemblance of the ruins of some vast edifice and carried
our thoughts back to the remote period when submarine volcanoes
gave birth to new islands or rent continents asunder every thing
which surrounded us seemed to indicate destruction and sterility
but the back-ground of the picture the coasts of lancerota
presented a more smiling aspect in a narrow pass between two
hills crowned with scattered tufts of trees marks of cultivation
were visible the last rays of the sun gilded the corn ready for
the sickle even the desert is animated wherever we can discover a
trace of the industry of man

we endeavoured to get out of this bay by the pass which separates
alegranza from montana clara and through which we had easily
entered to land at the northern point of graciosa the wind having
fallen the currents drove us very near a rock on which the sea
broke with violence and which is noted in the old charts under the
name of hell or infierno as we examined this rock at the distance
of two cables' length we found that it was a mass of lava three or
four toises high full of cavities and covered with scoriae
resembling coke we may presume that this rock* (* i must here
observe that this rock is noted on the celebrated venetian chart
of andrea bianco but that the name of infierno is given as in the
more ancient chart of picigano made in 1367 to teneriffe without
doubt because the guanches considered the peak as the entrance into
hell in the same latitudes an island made its appearance in 1811)
which modern charts call the west rock (roca del oeste) was raised
by volcanic fire and it might heretofore have been much higher
for the new island of the azores which rose from the sea at
successive periods in 1638 and 1719 had reached 354 feet when it
totally disappeared in 1723 to the depth of 480 feet this opinion
on the origin of the basaltic mass of the infierno is confirmed by
a phenomenon which was observed about the middle of the last
century in these same latitudes at the time of the eruption of the
volcano of temanfaya two pyramidal hills of lithoid lava rose from
the bottom of the ocean and gradually united themselves with the
island of lancerota

as we were prevented by the fall of the wind and by the currents
from repassing the channel of alegranza we resolved on tacking
during the night between the island of clara and the west rock
this resolution had nearly proved fatal a calm is very dangerous
near this rock towards which the current drives with considerable
force we began to feel the effects of this current at midnight
the proximity of the stony masses which rise perpendicularly above
the water deprived us of the little wind which blew the sloop no
longer obeyed the helm and we dreaded striking every instant it
is difficult to conceive how a mass of basalt insulated in the
vast expanse of the ocean can cause so considerable a motion of
the waters these phenomena worthy the attention of naturalists
are well known to mariners they are extremely to be dreaded in the
pacific ocean particularly in the small archipelago of the islands
of galapagos the difference of temperature which exists between
the fluid and the mass of rocks does not explain the direction
which these currents take and how can we admit that the water is
engulfed at the base of these rocks (which often are not of
volcanic origin) and that this continual engulfing determines the
particles of water to fill up the vacuum that takes place

the wind having freshened a little towards the morning on the 18th
we succeeded in passing the channel we drew very near the infierno
the second time and remarked the large crevices through which the
gaseous fluids probably issued when this basaltic mass was raised
we lost sight of the small islands of alegranza montana clara and
graciosa which appear never to have been inhabited by the
guanches they are now visited only for the purpose of gathering
archil which production is however less sought after since so
many other lichens of the north of europe have been found to yield
materials proper for dyeing montana clara is noted for its
beautiful canary-birds the note of these birds varies with their
flocks like that of our chaffinches which often differs in two
neighbouring districts montana clara yields pasture for goats a
fact which proves that the interior of this islet is less arid than
its coasts the name of alegranza is synonymous with the joyous
(la joyeuse) which denomination it received from the first
conquerors of the canary islands the two norman barons jean de
bethencourt and gadifer de salle this was the first point on which
they landed after remaining several days at graciosa a small part
of which we examined they conceived the project of taking
possession of the neighbouring island of lancerota where they were
welcomed by guadarfia sovereign of the guanches with the same
hospitality that cortez found in the palace of montezuma the
shepherd king who had no other riches than his goats became the
victim of base treachery like the sultan of mexico

we sailed along the coasts of lancerota of the island of lobos
and of forteventura the second of these islands seems to have
anciently formed part of the two others this geological hypothesis
was started in the seventeenth century by the franciscan juan
galindo that writer supposed that king juba had named six canary
islands only because in his time three among them were
contiguous without admitting the probability of this hypothesis
some learned geographers have imagined they recognized in the two
islands nivaria and ombrios the canaria and capraria of the
ancients

the haziness of the horizon prevented us during the whole of our
passage from lancerota to teneriffe from discovering the summit of
the peak of teyde if the height of this volcano is 1905 toises as
the last trigonometrical measure of borda indicates its summit
ought to be visible at a distance of 43 leagues supposing the eye
on a level with the ocean and a refraction equal to 0079 of
distance it has been doubted whether the peak has ever been seen
from the channel which separates lancerota from forteventura and
which is distant from the volcano according to the chart of
varela 2 degrees 29 minutes or nearly 50 leagues this phenomenon
appears nevertheless to have been verified by several officers of
the spanish navy i had in my hand on board the pizarro a
journal in which it was noted that the peak of teneriffe had been
seen at 135 miles distance near the southern cape of lancerota
called pichiguera its summit was discovered under an angle
considerable enough to lead the observer don manual baruti to
conclude that the volcano might have been visible at nine miles
farther it was in september towards evening and in very damp
weather reckoning fifteen feet for the elevation of the eye i
find that to render an account of this phenomenon we must suppose
a refraction equal to 0158 of the arch which is not very
extraordinary for the temperate zone according to the observations
of general roy the refractions vary in england from one-twentieth
to one-third and if it be true that they reach these extreme
limits on the coast of africa (which i much doubt) the peak in
certain circumstances may be seen on the deck of a vessel as far
off as 61 leagues

navigators who have much frequented these latitudes and who can
reflect on the physical causes of the phenomena are surprised that
the peaks of teyde and of the azores* (* the height of this peak of
the azores according to fleurieu is 1100 toises to ferrer 1238
toises and to tofino 1260 toises but these measures are only
approximative estimates the captain of the pizarro don manuel
cagigal proved to me by his journal that he observed the peak of
the azores at the distance of 37 leagues when he was sure of his
latitude within two minutes the volcano was seen at 4 degrees
south-east so that the error in longitude must have an almost
imperceptible influence in the estimation of the distance
nevertheless the angle which the peak of the azores subtended was
so great that the captain of the pizarro was of opinion this
volcano must be visible at more than 40 or 42 leagues the distance
of 37 leagues supposes an elevation of 1431 toises) are sometimes
visible at a very great distance though at other times they are
not seen when the distance is much less and the sky appears serene
and the horizon free from fogs these circumstances are the more
worthy of attention because vessels returning to europe sometimes
wait impatiently for a sight of these mountains to rectify their
longitude and think themselves much farther off than they really
are when in fine weather these peaks are not perceptible at
distances where the angles subtended must be very considerable the
constitution of the atmosphere has a great influence on the
visibility of distant objects it may be admitted that in general
the peak of teneriffe is seldom seen at a great distance in the
warm and dry months of july and august and that on the contrary
it is seen at very extraordinary distances in the months of january
and february when the sky is slightly clouded and immediately
after a heavy rain or a few hours before it falls it appears that
the transparency of the air is prodigiously increased as we have
already observed when a certain quantity of water is uniformly
diffused through the atmosphere independent of these observations
it is not astonishing that the peak of teyde should be seldomer
visible at a very remote distance than the summits of the andes
to which during so long a time my observations were directed
this peak inferior in height to those parts of the chain of mount
atlas at the foot of which is the city of morocco is not like
those points covered with perpetual snows the piton or
sugar-loaf which terminates the peak no doubt reflects a great
quantity of light owing to the whitish colour of the pumice-stone
thrown up by the crater but the height of that little truncated
cone does not form a twenty-second part of the total elevation the
flanks of the volcano are covered either with blocks of black and
scorified lava or with a luxuriant vegetation the masses of which
reflect the less light as the leaves of the trees are separated
from each other by shadows of more considerable extent than that of
the part enlightened

hence it results that setting aside the piton the peak of teyde
belongs to that class of mountains which according to the
expression of bouger are seen at considerable distances only in a
negative manner because they intercept the light which is
transmitted to us from the extreme limits of the atmosphere and we
perceive their existence only on account of the difference of
intensity subsisting between the aerial light which surrounds them
and that which is reflected by the particles of air placed between
the mountains and the eye of the observer as we withdraw from the
isle of teneriffe the piton or sugar-loaf is seen for a
considerable space of time in a positive manner because it
reflects a whitish light and clearly detaches itself from the sky
but as this cone is only 80 toises high by 40 in breadth at its
summit it has recently been a question whether from the
diminutiveness of its mass it can be visible at distances which
exceed 40 leagues and whether it be not probable that navigators
distinguish the peaks as a small cloud above the horizon only when
the base of the piton begins to be visible on it if we admit that
the mean breadth of the sugar-loaf is 100 toises we find that the
little cone at 40 leagues distance still subtends in the
horizontal direction an angle of more than three minutes this
angle is considerable enough to render an object visible and if
the height of the piton greatly exceeded its base the angle in the
horizontal direction might be still smaller and the object still
continue to make an impression on our visual organs for
micrometrical observations have proved that the limit of vision is
but a minute only when the dimensions of the objects are the same
in every direction we distinguish at a distance by the eye only
trunks of trees insulated in a vast plain though the subtended
angle be under twenty-five seconds

as the visibility of an object detaching itself in a brown colour
depends on the quantities of light which the eye meets on two
lines one of which ends at the mountain and the other extends to
the surface of the aerial ocean it follows that the farther we
remove from the object the smaller the difference becomes between
the light of the surrounding atmosphere and that of the strata of
air before the mountain for this reason when less elevated
summits begin to appear above the horizon they present themselves
at first under a darker hue than those we discern at very great
distances in the same manner the visibility of mountains seen
only in a negative manner does not depend solely on the state of
the lower regions of the air to which our meteorological
observations are limited but also on the transparency and physical
constitution of the air in the most elevated parts for the image
detaches itself better in proportion as the aerial light which
comes from the limits of the atmosphere has been originally more
intense or has undergone less loss in its passage this
consideration explains to a certain point why under a perfectly
serene sky the state of the thermometer and the hygrometer being
precisely the same in the air nearest the earth the peak is
sometimes visible and at other times invisible to navigators at
equal distances it is even probable that the chance of perceiving
this volcano would not be greater if the ashy cone at the summit
of which is the mouth of the crater were equal as in vesuvius to
a quarter of the total height these ashes being pumice-stone
crumbled into dust do not reflect as much light as the snow of the
andes and they cause the mountain seen from afar to detach
itself not in a bright but in a dark hue the ashes also
contribute if we may use the expression to equalize the portions
of aerial light the variable difference of which renders the
object more or less distinctly visible calcareous mountains
devoid of vegetable earth summits covered with granitic sand the
high savannahs of the cordilleras* (* los pajonales from paja
straw this is the name given to the region of the gramina which
encircles the zone of the perpetual snows) which are of a golden
yellow are undoubtedly distinguished at small distances better
than objects which are seen in a negative manner but the theory
indicates a certain limit beyond which these last detach
themselves more distinctly from the azure vault of the sky

the colossal summits of quito and peru towering above the limit of
the perpetual snows concentre all the peculiarities which must
render them visible at very small angles the circular summit of
the peak of teneriffe is only a hundred toises in diameter
according to the measures i made at riobamba in 1803 the dome of
the chimborazo 153 toises below its summit consequently in a
point which is 1300 toises higher than the peak is still 673
toises (1312 metres) in breadth the zone of perpetual snows also
forms a fourth of the height of the mountain and the base of this
zone seen on the coast of the pacific fills an extent of 3437
toises (6700 metres) but though chimborazo is two-thirds higher
than the peak we do not see it on account of the curve of the
globe at more than 38 miles and a third farther distant the
radiant brilliancy of its snows when at the port of guayaquil at
the close of the rainy season chimborazo is discerned on the
horizon may lead us to suppose that it must be seen at a very
great distance in the south sea pilots highly worthy of credit
have assured me that they have seen it from the rock of muerto to
the south west of the isle of puna at a distance of 47 leagues
whenever it has been seen at a greater distance the observers
uncertain of their longitude have not been in a situation to
furnish precise data

aerial light projected on mountains increases the visibility of
those which are seen positively its power diminishes on the
contrary the visibility of objects which like the peak of
teneriffe and that of the azores detach themselves in a brown
tint bouguer relying on theoretical considerations was of
opinion that according to the constitution of our atmosphere
mountains seen negatively cannot be perceived at distances
exceeding 35 leagues it is important here to observe that these
calculations are contrary to experience the peak of teneriffe has
been often seen at the distance of 36 38 and even at 40 leagues
moreover in the vicinity of the sandwich islands the summit of
mowna-roa at a season when it was without snows has been seen on
the skirt of the horizon at the distance of 53 leagues this is
the most striking example we have hitherto known of the visibility
of a mountain and it is the more remarkable that an object seen
negatively furnishes this example

the volcanoes of teneriffe and of the azores the sierra nevada of
santa martha the peak of orizaba the silla of caracas mowna-roa
and mount st elias insulated in the vast extent of the seas or
placed on the coasts of continents serve as sea-marks to direct
the pilot when he has no means of determining the position of the
vessel by the observation of the stars everything which has a
relation to the visibility of these natural seamarks is
interesting to the safety of navigation

stay at tenerife
journey from santa cruz to orotava
excursion to the summit of the peak of teyde

from the time of our departure from graciosa the horizon continued
so hazy that notwithstanding the considerable height of the
mountains of canary* (* isla de la gran canaria) we did not
discover that island till the evening of the 18th of june it is
the granary of the archipelago of the fortunate islands and what
is very remarkable in a region situated beyond the limits of the
tropics we were assured that in some districts there are two
wheat harvests in the year one in february and the other in june
canary has never been visited by a learned mineralogist yet this
island is so much the more worthy of observation as the
physiognomy of its mountains disposed in parallel chains appeared
to me to differ entirely from that of the summits of lancerota and
teneriffe nothing is more interesting to the geologist than to
observe the relations on the same point of the globe between
volcanic countries and those which are primitive or secondary
when the canary islands shall have been examined in all the parts
which compose the system of these mountains we shall find that we
have been too precipitate in considering the whole group as raised
by the action of submarine fires

on the morning of the 19th we discovered the point of naga but
the peak of teneriffe was still invisible the land obscured by a
thick mist presented forms that were vague and confused as we
approached the road of santa cruz we observed that the mist driven
by the winds drew nearer to us the sea was strongly agitated as
it most commonly is in those latitudes we anchored after several
soundings for the mist was so thick that we could scarcely
distinguish objects at a few cables' distance but at the moment we
began to salute the place the fog was instantly dispelled the
peak of teyde appeared in a break above the clouds and the first
rays of the sun which had not yet risen on us illumined the
summit of the volcano

we hastened to the prow of the vessel to behold the magnificent
spectacle and at the same instant we saw four english vessels
lying to and very near our stern we had passed without being
perceived and the same mist which had concealed the peak from our
view had saved us from the risk of being carried back to europe
the pizarro stood in as close as possible to the fort to be under
its protection it was on this shore that in the landing
attempted by the english two years before our arrival in july
1797 admiral nelson had his arm carried off by a cannon-ball

the situation of the town of santa cruz is very similar to that of
la guayra the most frequented port of the province of caraccas
the heat is excessive in both places and from the same causes but
the aspect of santa cruz is more gloomy on a narrow and sandy
beach houses of dazzling whiteness with flat roofs and windows
without glass are built close against a wall of black
perpendicular rock devoid of vegetation a fine mole built of
freestone and the public walk planted with poplars are the only
objects which break the sameness of the landscape the view of the
peak as it presents itself above santa cruz is much less
picturesque than that we enjoy from the port of orotava there a
highly cultured and smiling plain presents a pleasing contrast to
the wild aspect of the volcano from the groups of palm trees and
bananas which line the coast to the region of the arbutus the
laurel and the pine the volcanic rock is crowned with luxuriant
vegetation we easily conceive how the inhabitants even of the
beautiful climates of greece and italy might fancy they recognised
one of the fortunate isles in the western part of teneriffe the
eastern side that of santa cruz on the contrary is every where
stamped with sterility the summit of the peak is not more arid
than the promontory of basaltic lava which stretches towards the
point of naga and on which succulent plants springing up in the
clefts of the rocks scarcely indicate a preparation of soil at
the port of orotava the top of the piton subtends an angle in
height of more than eleven degrees and a half while at the mole of
santa cruz* (* the oblique distances from the top of the volcano to
orotava and to santa cruz are nearly 8600 toises and 22500 toises)
the angle scarcely exceeds 4 degrees 36 minutes

notwithstanding this difference and though in the latter place the
volcano rises above the horizon scarcely as much as vesuvius seen
from the mole of naples the aspect of the peak is still very
majestic when those who anchor in the road discern it for the
first time the piton alone was visible to us its cone projected
itself on a sky of the purest blue whilst dark thick clouds
enveloped the rest of the mountain to the height of 1800 toises
the pumice-stone illumined by the first rays of the sun reflected
a reddish light like that which tinges the summits of the higher
alps this light by degrees becomes dazzlingly white and deceived
like most travellers we thought that the peak was still covered
with snow and that we should with difficulty reach the edge of the
crater

we have remarked in the cordillera of the andes that the conical
mountains such as cotopaxi and tungurahua are oftener seen free
from clouds than those of which the tops are broken into bristly
points like antisana and pichincha but the peak of teneriffe
notwithstanding its pyramidical form is a great part of the year
enveloped in vapours and is sometimes during several weeks
invisible from the road of santa cruz its position to the west of
an immense continent and its insulated situation in the midst of
the sea are no doubt the causes of this phenomenon navigators are
well aware that even the smallest islets and those which are
without mountains collect and harbour the clouds the decrement of
heat is also different above the plains of africa and above the
surface of the atlantic and the strata of air brought by the
trade winds cool in proportion as they advance towards the west
if the air has been extremely dry above the burning sands of the
desert it is very quickly saturated when it enters into contact
with the surface of the sea or with the air that lies on that
surface it is easy to conceive therefore why vapours become
visible in the atmospherical strata which at a distance from the
continent have no longer the same temperature as when they began
to be saturated with water the considerable mass of a mountain
rising in the midst of the atlantic is also an obstacle to the
clouds which are driven out to sea by the winds

on entering the streets of santa cruz we felt a suffocating heat
though the thermometer was not above twenty-five degrees those who
have for a long time inhaled the air of the sea suffer every time
they land not because this air contains more oxygen than the air
on shore as has been erroneously supposed but because it is less
charged with those gaseous combinations which the animal and
vegetable substances and the mud resulting from their
decomposition pour into the atmosphere miasms that escape
chemical analysis have a powerful effect on our organs especially
when they have not for a long while been exposed to the same kind
of irritation

santa cruz the anaza of the guanches is a neat town with a
population of 8000 souls i was not struck with the vast number of
monks and secular ecclesiastics which travellers have thought
themselves bound to find in every country under the spanish
government nor shall i stop to enter into the description of the
churches the library of the dominicans which contains scarcely a
few hundred volumes the mole where the inhabitants assemble to
inhale the freshness of the evening breeze or the famed monument
of carrara marble thirty feet high dedicated to our lady of
candelaria in memory of the miraculous appearance of the virgin
in 1392 at chimisay near guimar the port of santa cruz may be
considered as a great caravanserai on the road to america and the
indies every traveller who writes the narrative of his adventures
begins by a description of madeira and teneriffe and if in the
natural history of these islands there yet remains an immense field
untrodden we must admit that the topography of the little towns of
funchal santa cruz laguna and orotava leaves scarcely anything
untold

the recommendation of the court of madrid procured for us in the
canaries as in all the other spanish possessions the most
satisfactory reception the captain-general gave us immediate
permission to examine the island colonel armiaga who commanded a
regiment of infantry received us into his house with kind
hospitality we could not cease admiring the banana the papaw
tree the poinciana pulcherrima and other plants which we had
hitherto seen only in hot-houses cultivated in his garden in the
open air the climate of the canaries however is not warm enough to
ripen the real platano arton with triangular fruit from seven to
eight inches long and which requiring a temperature of 24
centesimal degrees does not flourish even in the valley of
caracas the bananas of teneriffe are those named by the spanish
planters camburis or guineos and dominicos the camburi which
suffers least from cold is cultivated with success even at malaga
where the temperature is only 18 degrees but the fruit we see
occasionally at cadiz comes from the canary islands by vessels
which make the passage in three or four days in general the musa
known by every people under the torrid zone though hitherto never
found in a wild state has as great a variety of fruit as our apple
and pear trees these varieties which are confounded by the
greater part of botanists though they require very different
climates have become permanent by long cultivation

we went to herborize in the evening in the direction of the fort of
passo alto along the basaltic rocks that close the promontory of
naga we were very little satisfied with our harvest for the
drought and dust had almost destroyed vegetation the cacalia
kleinia the euphorbia canariensis and several other succulent
plants which draw their nourishment from the air rather than the
soil on which they grow reminded us by their appearance that this
group of islands belongs to africa and even to the most arid part
of that continent

though the captain of the pizarro had orders to stop long enough at
teneriffe to give us time to scale the summit of the peak if the
snows did not prevent our ascent we received notice on account of
the blockade of the english ships not to expect a longer delay
than four or five days we consequently hastened our departure for
the port of orotava which is situated on the western declivity of
the volcano where we were sure of finding guides i could find no
one at santa cruz who had mounted the peak and i was not surprised
at this the most curious objects become less interesting in
proportion as they are near to us and i have known inhabitants of
schaffhausen in switzerland who had never seen the fall of the
rhine but at a distance

on the 20th of june before sunrise we began our excursion by
ascending to the villa de laguna estimated to be at the elevation
of 350 toises above the port of santa cruz we could not verify
this estimate of the height the surf not having permitted us to
return on board during the night to take our barometers and
dipping-needle as we foresaw that our expedition to the peak would
be very precipitate we consoled ourselves with the reflection that
it was well not to expose instruments which were to serve us in
countries less known by europeans the road by which we ascended to
laguna is on the right of a torrent or baranco which in the rainy
season forms fine cascades it is narrow and tortuous near the
town we met some white camels which seemed to be very slightly
laden the chief employment of these animals is to transport
merchandise from the custom-house to the warehouses of the
merchants they are generally laden with two chests of havannah
sugar which together weigh 900 pounds but this load may be
augmented to thirteen hundred-weight or 52 arrobas of castile
camels are not numerous at teneriffe whilst they exist by
thousands in the two islands of lancerota and forteventura the
climate and vegetation of these islands which are situated nearer
africa are more analogous to those of that continent it is very
extraordinary that this useful animal which breeds in south
america should be seldom propagated at teneriffe in the fertile
district of adexe only where the plantations of the sugar-cane are
most considerable camels have sometimes been known to breed these
beasts of burden as well as horses were brought into the canary
islands in the fifteenth century by the norman conquerors the
guanches were previously unacquainted with them and this fact
seems to be very well accounted for by the difficulty of
transporting an animal of such bulk in frail canoes without the
necessity of considering the guanches as a remnant of the people of
atlantis or a different race from that of the western africans

the hill on which the town of san christobal de la laguna is
built belongs to the system of basaltic mountains which
independent of the system of less ancient volcanic rocks form a
broad girdle around the peak of teneriffe the basalt on which we
walked was darkish brown compact half-decomposed and when
breathed on emitted a clayey smell we discovered amphibole
olivine* (* peridot granuliforme hauy) and translucid pyroxenes
* (* augite werner) with a perfectly lamellar fracture of a
pale olive green and often crystallized in prisms of six planes
the first of these substances is extremely rare at teneriffe and i
never found it in the lavas of vesuvius but those of etna contain
it in abundance notwithstanding the great number of blocks which
we stopped to break to the great regret of our guides we could
discover neither nepheline leucite* (* amphigene hauy) nor
feldspar this last which is so common in the basaltic lavas of
the island of ischia does not begin to appear at teneriffe till
we approach the volcano the rock of laguna is not columnar but is
divided into ledges of small thickness and inclined to the east
at an angle of 30 or 40 degrees it has nowhere the appearance of a
current of lava flowing from the sides of the peak if the present
volcano has given birth to these basalts we must suppose that
like the substances which compose the somma at the back of
vesuvius they are the effect of a submarine effusion in which the
liquid mass has formed strata a few arborescent euphorbias the
cacalia kleinia and indian figs (cactus) which have become wild
in the canary islands as well as in the south of europe and the
whole continent of africa are the only plants we see on these arid
rocks the feet of our mules were slipping every moment on beds of
stone which were very steep we nevertheless recognized the
remains of an ancient pavement in these colonies we discover at
every step some traces of that activity which characterized the
spanish nation in the 16th century

as we approached laguna we felt the temperature of the atmosphere
gradually become lower this sensation was so much the more
agreeable as we found the air of santa cruz very oppressive as
our organs are more affected by disagreeable impressions the
change of temperature becomes still more sensible when we return
from laguna to the port we seem then to be drawing near the mouth
of a furnace the same impression is felt when on the coast of
caracas we descend from the mountain of avila to the port of la
guayra according to the law of the decrement of heat three
hundred and fifty toises in height produce in this latitude only
three or four degrees difference in temperature the heat which
overpowers the traveller on his entrance into santa cruz or la
guayra must consequently be attributed to the reverberation from
the rocks against which these towns are built

the perpetual coolness which prevails at laguna causes it to be
considered in the canaries a delightful abode situated in a small
plain surrounded by gardens protected by a hill which is crowned
by a wood of laurels myrtle and arbutus the capital of teneriffe
is very beautifully placed we should be mistaken if relying on
the account of some travellers we believed it seated on the border
of a lake the rain sometimes forms a sheet of water of
considerable extent and the geologist who beholds in everything
the past rather than the present state of nature can have no doubt
but that the whole plain is a great basin dried up laguna has
fallen from its opulence since the lateral eruptions of the
volcano have destroyed the port of garachico and since santa cruz
has become the central point of the commerce of the island it
contains only 9000 inhabitants of whom nearly 400 are monks
distributed in six convents the town is surrounded with a great
number of windmills which indicate the cultivation of wheat in
these high countries i shall observe on this occasion that
different kinds of grain were known to the guanches they called
wheat at teneriffe tano at lancerota triffa barley in the grand
canary bore the name of aramotanoque and at lancerota it was
called tamosen the flour of roasted barley (gofio) and goat's-milk
constituted the principal food of the people on the origin of
which so many systematic fables have been current these aliments
sufficiently prove that the race of the guanches belonged to the
nations of the old continent perhaps to those of caucasus and not
like the rest of the atlantides* to the inhabitants of the new
world (* without entering here into any discussion respecting the
existence of the atlantis i may cite the opinion of diodorus
siculus according to whom the atlantides were ignorant of the use
of corn because they were separated from the rest of mankind
before these gramina were cultivated) these before the arrival
of the europeans were unacquainted with corn milk and cheese

a great number of chapels which the spaniards call ermitas
encircle the town of laguna shaded by trees of perpetual verdure
and erected on small eminences these chapels add to the
picturesque effect of the landscape the interior of the town is
not equal to its external appearance the houses are solidly built
but very antique and the streets seem deserted a botanist ought
not to complain of the antiquity of the edifices the roofs and
walls are covered with canary house-leek and those elegant
trichomanes mentioned by every traveller these plants are
nourished by the abundant mists

mr anderson the naturalist in the third voyage of captain cook
advises physicians to send their patients to teneriffe on account
of the mildness of the temperature and the equal climate of the
canaries the ground on these islands rises in an amphitheatre and
presents simultaneously as in peru and mexico the temperature of
every climate from the heat of africa to the cold of the higher
alps santa cruz the port of orotava the town of the same name
and that of laguna are four places the mean temperatures of which
form a descending series in the south of europe the change of the
seasons is too sensibly felt to present the same advantages
teneriffe on the contrary situated as it were on the threshold of
the tropics though but a few days' sail from spain shares in the
charms which nature has lavished on the equinoctial regions
vegetation here displays some of her fairest and most majestic
forms in the banana and the palm-tree he who is alive to the
charms of nature finds in this delicious island remedies still more
potent than the climate no abode appeared to me more fitted to
dissipate melancholy and restore peace to the perturbed mind than
that of teneriffe or madeira these advantages are the effect not
of the beauty of the site and the purity of the air alone the
moral feeling is no longer harrowed up by the sight of slavery the
presence of which is so revolting in the west indies and in every
other place to which european colonists have conveyed what they
call their civilization and their industry

in winter the climate of laguna is extremely foggy and the
inhabitants often complain of the cold a fall of snow however
has never been seen a fact which may seem to indicate that the
mean temperature of this town must be above 187 degrees (15
degrees r) that is to say higher than that of naples i do not
lay this down as an unexceptional conclusion for in winter the
refrigeration of the clouds does not depend so much on the mean
temperature of the whole year as on the instantaneous diminution
of heat to which a district is exposed by its local situation the
mean temperature of the capital of mexico for instance is only
168 degrees (135 degrees r) nevertheless in the space of a
hundred years snow has fallen only once while in the south of
europe and in africa it snows in places where the mean temperature
is above 19 degrees

the vicinity of the sea renders the climate of laguna more mild in
winter than might be expected arising from its elevation above the
level of the ocean i was astonished to learn that m broussonnet
had planted in the midst of this town in the garden of the marquis
de nava the bread-fruit tree (artocarpus incisa) and
cinnamon-tree (laurus cinnamomum) these valuable productions of
the south sea and the east indies are naturalized there as well as
at orotava does not this fact prove that the bread-fruit might
flourish in calabria sicily and granada? the culture of the
coffee-tree has not equally succeeded at laguna though its fruit
ripens at teguesta as well as between the port of orotava and the
village of st juan de la rambla it is probable that some local
circumstances perhaps the nature of the soil and the winds that
prevail in the flowering season are the cause of this phenomenon
in other regions in the neighbourhood of naples for instance the
coffee-tree thrives abundantly though the mean temperature
scarcely rises above 18 centigrade degrees

no person has ascertained in the island of teneriffe the lowest
height at which snow falls every year this fact though easy of
verification by barometrical measurements has hitherto been
generally neglected under every zone it is nevertheless highly
interesting both to agriculture in the colonies and meteorology
and fully as important as the measure of the limit of the perpetual
snows my observations furnished me with the data set down in the
following table 

column 1 north latitude

column 2 lowest height in toises at which snow falls

column 3 lowest height in metres at which snow falls

column 4 inferior limit in toises of the perpetual snows

column 5 inferior limit in metres of the perpetual snows

column 6 difference in toises of columns 4 and 5

column 7 difference in metres of columns 4 and 5

column 8 mean temperature degrees centigrade

column 9 mean temperature degrees reaum

  0   2040  3976  2460  4794   420   818  27    216

  20  1550  3020  2360  4598   810  1578  245  196

  40     0     0  1540  3001  1540  3001  17    136

this table presents only the ordinary state of nature that is to
say the phenomena as they are annually observed exceptions
founded on particular local circumstances exist thus it sometimes
snows though seldom at naples at lisbon and even at malaga
consequently as low as the 37th degree of latitude and as we have
just observed snow has been seen to fall at mexico the elevation
of which is 1173 toises above the level of the ocean this
phenomenon which had not been seen for several centuries took
place on the day that the jesuits were expelled and was attributed
by the people to that act of severity a more striking exception
was found in the climate of valladolid the capital of the province
of mechoacan according to my measures the height of this town
situate in latitude 19 degrees 42 minutes is only a thousand
toises and yet a few years before our arrival in new spain the
streets were covered with snow for some hours

snow had been seen to fall also at teneriffe in a place lying
above esperanza de la laguna very near the town of that name in
the gardens of which the artocarpus flourishes this extraordinary
fact was confirmed to m broussonnet by very aged persons the
erica arborea the myrica faya and the arbutus callicarpa* (*
this fine arbutus imported by m broussonnet is very different
from the arbutus laurifolia with which it has been confounded but
which belongs to north america) did not suffer from the snow but
it destroyed all the vines in the open air this observation is
interesting to vegetable physiology in hot countries the plants
are so vigorous that cold is less injurious to them provided it
be of short duration i have seen the banana cultivated in the
island of cuba in places where the thermometer descends to seven
centesimal degrees and sometimes very near freezing point in
italy and spain the orange and date-trees do not perish though the
cold during the night may be two degrees below freezing point in
general it is remarked by cultivators that the trees which grow in
a fertile soil are less delicate and consequently less affected by
great changes in the temperature than those which grow in land
that affords but little nutriment* (* the mulberries cultivated
in the thin and sandy soils of countries bordering on the baltic
sea are examples of this feebleness of organization the late
frosts do more injury to them than to the mulberries of piedmont
in italy a cold of 5 degrees below freezing point does not destroy
robust orange trees according to m galesio these trees less
tender than the lemon and bergamot orange trees freeze only at ten
centesimal degrees below freezing point)

in order to pass from the town of laguna to the port of orotava and
the western coast of teneriffe we cross at first a hilly region
covered with black and argillaceous earth in which are found some
small crystals of pyroxene the waters most probably detach these
crystals from the neighbouring rocks as at frascati near rome
unfortunately strata of ferruginous earth conceal the soil from
the researches of the geologist it is only in some ravines that
we find columnar basalts somewhat curved and above them very
recent breccia resembling volcanic tufa the breccia contain
fragments of the same basalts which they cover and it is asserted
that marine petrifactions are observed in them the same phenomenon
occurs in the vicentin near montechio maggiore

the valley of tacoronte is the entrance into that charming country
of which travellers of every nation have spoken with rapturous
enthusiasm under the torrid zone i found sites where nature is
more majestic and richer in the display of organic forms but
after having traversed the banks of the orinoco the cordilleras of
peru and the most beautiful valleys of mexico i own that i have
never beheld a prospect more varied more attractive more
harmonious in the distribution of the masses of verdure and of
rocks than the western coast of teneriffe

the sea-coast is lined with date and cocoa trees groups of the
musa as the country rises form a pleasing contrast with the
dragon-tree the trunks of which have been justly compared to the
tortuous form of the serpent the declivities are covered with
vines which throw their branches over towering poles orange trees
loaded with flowers myrtles and cypress trees encircle the
chapels reared to devotion on the isolated hills the divisions of
landed property are marked by hedges formed of the agave and the
cactus an innumerable quantity of cryptogamous plants among which
ferns are the most predominant cover the walls and are moistened
by small springs of limpid water in winter when the volcano is
buried under ice and snow this district enjoys perpetual spring
in summer as the day declines the breezes from the sea diffuse a
delicious freshness the population of this coast is very
considerable and it appears to be still greater than it is
because the houses and gardens are distant from each other which
adds to the picturesque beauty of the scene unhappily the real
welfare of the inhabitants does not correspond with the exertions
of their industry or with the advantages which nature has lavished
on this spot the farmers are not land-owners the fruits of their
labour belong to the nobles and those feudal institutions which
for so long a time spread misery throughout europe still press
heavily on the people of the canary islands

from tegueste and tacoronte to the village of st juan de la rambla
(which is celebrated for its excellent malmsey wine) the rising
hills are cultivated like a garden i might compare them to the
environs of capua and valentia if the western part of teneriffe
was not infinitely more beautiful on account of the proximity of
the peak which presents on every side a new point of view the
aspect of this mountain is interesting not merely from its gigantic
mass it excites the mind by carrying it back to the mysterious
source of its volcanic agency for thousands of years no flames or
light have been perceived on the summit of the piton nevertheless
enormous lateral eruptions the last of which took place in 1798
are proofs of the activity of a fire still far from being
extinguished there is also something that leaves a melancholy
impression on beholding a crater in the centre of a fertile and
well cultivated country the history of the globe informs us that
volcanoes destroy what they have been a long series of ages in
creating islands which the action of submarine fires has raised
above the waters are by degrees clothed in rich and smiling
verdure but these new lands are often laid waste by the renewed
action of the same power which caused them to emerge from the
bottom of the ocean islets which are now but heaps of scoriae and
volcanic ashes were once perhaps as fertile as the hills of
tacoronte and sauzal happy the country where man has no distrust
of the soil on which he lives

pursuing our course to the port of orotava we passed the smiling
hamlets of matanza and victoria these names are mingled together
in all the spanish colonies and they form an unpleasing contrast
with the peaceful and tranquil feelings which those countries
inspire matanza signifies slaughter or carnage and the word
alone recalls the price at which victory has been purchased in the
new world it generally indicates the defeat of the natives at
teneriffe the village of matanza was built in a place* (* the
ancient acantejo) where the spaniards were conquered by those same
guanches who soon after were sold as slaves in the markets of
europe

before we reached orotava we visited a botanic garden at a little
distance from the port we there found m le gros the french
vice-consul who had often scaled the summit of the peak and who
served us as an excellent guide he was accompanying captain baudin
in a voyage to the west indies when a dreadful tempest of which
m le dru has given an account in the narrative of his voyage to
porto rico forced the vessel to put into teneriffe there m le
gros was led by the beauty of the spot to settle it was he who
augmented scientific knowledge by the first accurate ideas of the
great lateral eruption of the peak which has been very improperly
called the explosion of the volcano of chahorra this eruption took
place on the 8th of june 1798

the establishment of a botanical garden at teneriffe is a very
happy idea on account of the influence it is likely to have on the
progress of botany and on the introduction of useful plants into
europe for the first conception of it we are indebted to the
marquis de nava he undertook at an enormous expense to level the
hill of durasno which rises as an amphitheatre and which was
begun to be planted in 1795 the marquis thought that the canary
islands from the mildness of their climate and geographical
position were the most suitable place for naturalising the
productions of the east and west indies and for inuring the plants
gradually to the colder temperature of the south of europe the
plants of asia africa and south america may easily be brought to
orotava and in order to introduce the bark-tree* into sicily
portugal or grenada it should be first planted at durasno or at
laguna and the shoots of this tree may afterwards be transported
into europe from the canaries (* i speak of the species of
bark-tree (cinchona) which at peru and in the kingdom of new
granada flourish on the back of the cordilleras at the height of
between 1000 and 1500 toises in places where the thermometer is
between nine and ten degrees during the day and from three to four
during the night the orange bark-tree (cinchona lancifolia) is
much less delicate than the red bark-tree (c oblongifolia)) in
happier times when maritime wars shall no longer interrupt
communication the garden of teneriffe may become extremely useful
with respect to the great number of plants which are sent from the
indies to europe for ere they reach our coasts they often perish
owing to the length of the passage during which they inhale an air
impregnated with salt water these plants would meet at orotava
with the care and climate necessary for their preservation at
durasno the protea the psidium the jambos the chirimoya of
peru* (* annona cherimolia lamarck) the sensitive plant and the
heliconia grow in the open air we gathered the ripened seeds of
several beautiful species of glycine from new holland which the
governor of cumana mr emparan had successfully cultivated and
which grow wild on the coasts of south america

we arrived very late at the port of orotava* (* puerto de la cruz
the only fine port of the canary islands is that of st sebastian
in the isle of gomara) if we may give the name of port to a road
in which vessels are obliged to put to sea whenever the winds blow
violently from the north-west it is impossible to speak of orotava
without recalling to the remembrance of the friends of science the
name of don bernardo cologan whose house at all times was open to
travellers of every nation

we could have wished to have sojourned for some time in don
bernardo's house and to have visited with him the charming scenery
of st juan de la rambla and of rialexo de abaxo* (* this
last-named village stands at the foot of the lofty mountain of
tygayga) but on a voyage such as we had undertaken the present is
but little enjoyed continually haunted by the fear of not
executing the designs of the morrow we live in perpetual
uneasiness persons who are passionately fond of nature and the
arts feel the same sensations when they travel through switzerland
and italy enabled to see but a small portion of the objects which
allure them they are disturbed in their enjoyments by the
restraints they impose on themselves at every step

on the morning of the 21st of june we were on our way to the
summit of the volcano m le gros whose attentions were unwearied
m lalande secretary to the french consulate at santa cruz and
the english gardener at durasno joined us on this excursion the
day was not very fine and the summit of the peak which is
generally visible at orotava from sunrise till ten o'clock was
covered with thick clouds

we were agreeably surprised by the contrast between the vegetation
of this part of teneriffe and that of the environs of santa cruz
under the influence of a cool and humid climate the ground was
covered with beautiful verdure while on the road from santa cruz
to laguna the plants exhibited nothing but capsules emptied of
their seeds near the port of santa cruz the strength of the
vegetation is an obstacle to geological research we passed along
the base of two small hills which rise in the form of bells
observations made at vesuvius and in auvergne lead us to think that
these hills owe their origin to lateral eruptions of the great
volcano the hill called montanita de la villa seems indeed to have
emitted lavas and according to the tradition of the guanches an
eruption took place in 1430 colonel franqui assured borda that
the place is still to be seen whence the melted matter issued and
that the ashes which covered the ground adjacent were not yet
fertilized whenever the rock appeared we discovered basaltic
amygdaloid* (* basaltartiger mandelstein werner) covered with
hardened clay* (* bimstein-conglomerat w) which contains
rapilli or fragments of pumice-stone this last formation
resembles the tufas of pausilippo and the strata of puzzolana
which i found in the valley of quito at the foot of the volcano of
pichincha the amygdaloid has very long pores like the superior
strata of the lavas of vesuvius arising probably from the action
of an elastic fluid forcing its way through the matter in fusion
notwithstanding these analogies i must here repeat that in all
the low region of the peak of teneriffe on the side of orotava i
have met with no flow of lava nor any current the limits of which
are strongly marked torrents and inundations change the surface of
the globe and when a great number of currents of lava meet and
spread over a plain as i have seen at vesuvius in the atrio dei
cavalli they seem to be confounded together and wear the
appearance of real strata

the villa de orotava has a pleasant aspect at a distance from the
great abundance of water which runs through the principal streets
the spring of agua mansa collected in two large reservoirs turns
several mills and is afterward discharged among the vineyards of
the adjacent hills the climate is still more refreshing at the
villa than at the port of la cruz from the influence of the
breeze which blows strong after ten in the morning the water
which has been dissolved in the air at a higher temperature
frequently precipitates itself and renders the climate very foggy
the villa is nearly 160 toises (312 metres) above the level of the
sea consequently 200 toises lower than the site on which laguna is
built it is observed also that the same kind of plants flower a
month later in this latter place

orotava the ancient taoro of the guanches is situated on a very
steep declivity the streets seem deserted the houses are solidly
built and of a gloomy appearance we passed along a lofty
aqueduct lined with a great number of fine ferns and visited
several gardens in which the fruit trees of the north of europe
are mingled with orange trees pomegranate and date trees we were
assured that these last were as little productive here as on the
coast of cumana although we had been made acquainted from the
narratives of many travellers with the dragon-tree of the garden
of m franqui we were not the less struck with its enormous
magnitude we were told that the trunk of this tree which is
mentioned in several very ancient documents as marking the
boundaries of a field was as gigantic in the fifteenth century as
it is at the present time its height appeared to us to be about 50
or 60 feet its circumference near the roots is 45 feet we could
not measure higher but sir george staunton found that 10 feet
from the ground the diameter of the trunk is still 12 english
feet which corresponds perfectly with the statement of borda who
found its mean circumference 33 feet 8 inches french measure the
trunk is divided into a great number of branches which rise in the
form of a candelabrum and are terminated by tufts of leaves like
the yucca which adorns the valley of mexico this division gives it
a very different appearance from that of the palm-tree

among organic creations this tree is undoubtedly together with
the adansonia or baobab of senegal one of the oldest inhabitants
of our globe the baobabs are of still greater dimensions than the
dragon-tree of orotava there are some which near the root measure
34 feet in diameter though their total height is only from 50 to
60 feet but we should observe that the adansonia like the
ochroma and all the plants of the family of bombax grow much more
rapidly* than the dracaena the vegetation of which is very slow
(* it is the same with the plane-tree (platanus occidentalis) which
m michaux measured at marietta on the banks of the ohio and
which at twenty feet from the ground was 157 feet in diameter
 "voyage a l'ouest des monts alleghany" 1804 page 93 the yew
chestnut oak plane-tree deciduous cypress bombax mimosa
caesalpina hymenaea and dracaena appear to me to be the plants
which in different climates present specimens of the most
extraordinary growth an oak discovered together with some gallic
helmets in 1809 in the turf pits of the department of the somme
near the village of yseux seven leagues from abbeville was about
the same size as the dragon-tree of orotava according to a memoir
by m traullee the trunk of this oak was 14 feet in diameter)
that in m franqui's garden still bears every year both flowers and
fruit its aspect forcibly exemplifies "that eternal youth of
nature" which is an inexhaustible source of motion and of life

the dracaena which is seen only in cultivated spots in the canary
islands at madeira and porto santo presents a curious phenomenon
with respect to the migration of plants it has never been found in
a wild state on the continent of africa the east indies is its
real country how has this tree been transplanted to teneriffe
where it is by no means common? does its existence prove that at
some very distant period the guanches had connexions with other
nations originally from asia?* (* the form of the dragon-tree is
exhibited in several species of the genus dracaena at the cape of
good hope in china and in new zealand but in new zealand it is
superseded by the form of the yucca for the dracaena borealis of
aiton is a convallaria of which it has all the appearance the
astringent juice known in commerce by the name of dragon's blood
is according to the inquiries we made on the spot the produce of
several american plants which do not belong to the same genus and
of which some are lianas at laguna toothpicks steeped in the
juice of the dragon-tree are made in the nunneries and are much
extolled as highly useful for keeping the gums in a healthy state)

on leaving orotava a narrow and stony pathway led us through a
beautiful forest of chestnut trees (el monte de castanos) to a
site covered with brambles some species of laurels and
arborescent heaths the trunks of the latter grow to an
extraordinary size and the flowers with which they are loaded form
an agreeable contrast during a great part of the year to the
hypericum canariense which is very abundant at this height we
stopped to take in our provision of water under a solitary
fir-tree this station is known in the country by the name of pino
del dornajito its height according to the barometrical
measurement of m de borda is 522 toises and it commands a
magnificent prospect of the sea and the whole of the northern part
of the island near pino del dornajito a little on the right of
the pathway is a copious spring of water into which we plunged
the thermometer which fell to 154 degrees at a hundred toises
distance from this spring is another equally limpid if we admit
that these waters indicate nearly the mean heat of the place whence
they issue we may fix the absolute elevation of the station at 520
toises supposing the mean temperature of the coast to be 21
degrees and allowing one degree for the decrement of caloric
corresponding under this zone to 93 toises we should not be
surprised if this spring remained a little below the heat of the
air since it probably takes its source in some more elevated part
of the peak and possibly communicates with the small subterranean
glaciers of which we shall speak hereafter the accordance just
observed between the barometrical and thermometrical measures is so
much more striking because in mountainous countries with steep
declivities the springs generally indicate too great a decrement
of caloric for they unite small currents of water which filtrate
at different heights and their temperature is consequently the
mean between the temperature of these currents the spring of
dornajito has considerable reputation in the country and at the
time i was there it was the only one known on the road which leads
to the summit of the volcano the formation of springs demands a
certain regularity in the direction and inclination of the strata
on a volcanic soil porous and splintered rocks absorb the rain
waters and convey them to considerable depths hence arises that
aridity observed in the greater part of the canary islands
notwithstanding the considerable height of their mountains and the
mass of clouds which navigators behold incessantly overhanging this
archipelago

from pino del dornajito to the crater of the volcano we continued
to ascend without crossing a single valley for the small ravines
(barancos) do not merit this name to the eye of the geologist the
whole island of teneriffe is but one mountain the almost
elliptical base of which is prolonged to the north-east and in
which may be distinguished several systems of volcanic rocks formed
at different epochs the chahorra or montana colorada and the
urca considered in the country as insulated volcanoes are only
little hills abutting on the peak and masking its pyramidal form
the great volcano the lateral eruptions of which have given birth
to vast promontories is not however precisely in the centre of the
island and this peculiarity of structure appears the less
surprising if we recollect that as the learned mineralogist m
cordier has observed it is not perhaps the small crater of the
piton which has been the principal agent in the changes undergone
by the island of teneriffe

above the region of arborescent heaths called monte verde is the
region of ferns nowhere in the temperate zone have i seen such
an abundance of the pteris blechnum and asplenium yet none of
these plants have the stateliness of the arborescent ferns which
at the height of five or six hundred toises form the principal
ornament of equinoctial america the root of the pteris aquilina
serves the inhabitants of palma and gomera for food they grind it
to powder and mix with it a quantity of barley-meal this
composition when boiled is called gofio the use of so homely an
aliment is a proof of the extreme poverty of the lower order of
people in the canary islands

monte verde is intersected by several small and very arid ravines
(canadas) and the region of ferns is succeeded by a wood of
juniper trees and firs which has suffered greatly from the
violence of hurricanes in this place mentioned by some travellers
under the name of caravela* (* "philosophical transactions" volume
29 page 317 carabela is the name of a vessel with lateen sails
the pines of the peak formerly were used as masts of vessels) mr
eden states that in the year 1705 he saw little flames which
according to the doctrine of the naturalists of his time he
attributes to sulphurous exhalations igniting spontaneously we
continued to ascend till we came to the rock of la gayta and to
portillo traversing this narrow pass between two basaltic hills
we entered the great plain of spartium at the time of the voyage
of laperouse m manneron had taken the levels of the peak from
the port of orotava to this elevated plain near 1400 toises above
the level of the sea but the want of water and the misconduct of
the guides prevented him from taking the levels to the top of the
volcano the results of the operation (which was two-thirds
completed) unfortunately were not sent to europe and the work is
still to be recommenced from the sea-coast

we spent two hours and a half in crossing the llano del retama
which appears like an immense sea of sand notwithstanding the
elevation of this site the centigrade thermometer rose in the
shade toward sunset to 138 degrees or 37 degrees higher than
toward noon at monte verde this augmentation of heat could be
attributed only to the reverberation from the ground and the
extent of the plain we suffered much from the suffocating dust of
the pumice-stone in which we were continually enveloped in the
midst of this plain are tufts of the retama which is the spartium
nubigenum of aiton m de martiniere one of the botanists who
perished in the expedition of laperouse wished to introduce this
beautiful shrub into languedoc where firewood is very scarce it
grows to the height of nine feet and is loaded with odoriferous
flowers with which the goat hunters that we met in our road had
decorated their hats the goats of the peak which are of a deep
brown colour are reckoned delicious food they browse on the
spartium and have run wild in the deserts from time immemorial
they have been transported to madeira where they are preferred to
the goats of europe

as far as the rock of gayta or the entrance of the extensive llano
del retama the peak of teneriffe is covered with beautiful
vegetation there are no traces of recent devastation we might
have imagined ourselves scaling the side of some volcano the fire
of which had been extinguished as remotely as that of monte cavo
near rome but scarcely had we reached the plain covered with
pumice-stone when the landscape changed its aspect and at every
step we met with large blocks of obsidian thrown out by the
volcano everything here speaks perfect solitude a few goats and
rabbits only bound across the plain the barren region of the peak
is nine square leagues and as the lower regions viewed from this
point retrograde in the distance the island appears an immense
heap of torrefied matter hemmed round by a scanty border of
vegetation

from the region of the spartium nubigenum we passed through narrow
defiles and small ravines hollowed at a very remote time by the
torrents first arriving at a more elevated plain (el monton de
trigo) then at the place where we intended to pass the night this
station which is more than 1530 toises above the coast bears the
name of the english halt (estancia de los ingleses* (* this
denomination was in use as early as the beginning of the last
century mr eden who corrupts all spanish words as do most
travellers in our own times calls it the stancha it is the
station des rochers of m borda as is proved by the barometrical
heights there observed these heights were in 1803 according to m
cordier 19 inches 95 lines and in 1776 according to messrs
borda and varela 19 inches 98 lines the barometer at orotava
keeping within nearly a line at the same height)) no doubt
because most of the travellers who formerly visited the peak were
englishmen two inclined rocks form a kind of cavern which affords
a shelter from the winds this point which is higher than the
summit of the canigou can be reached on the backs of mules and
here has ended the expedition of numbers of travellers who on
leaving orotava hoped to have ascended to the brink of the crater
though in the midst of summer and under an african sky we
suffered from cold during the night the thermometer descended as
low as to five degrees our guides made a large fire with the dry
branches of retama having neither tents nor cloaks we lay down on
some masses of rock and were singularly incommoded by the flame
and smoke which the wind drove towards us we had attempted to
form a kind of screen with cloths tied together but our enclosure
took fire which we did not perceive till the greater part had been
consumed by the flames we had never passed a night on a point so
elevated and we then little imagined that we should one day on
the ridge of the cordilleras inhabit towns higher than the summit
of the volcano we were to scale on the morrow as the temperature
diminished the peak became covered with thick clouds the approach
of night interrupts the play of the ascending current which
during the day rises from the plains towards the high regions of
the atmosphere and the air in cooling loses its capacity of
suspending water a strong northerly wind chased the clouds the
moon at intervals shooting through the vapours exposed its disk
on a firmament of the darkest blue and the view of the volcano
threw a majestic character over the nocturnal scenery sometimes
the peak was entirely hidden from our eyes by the fog at other
times it broke upon us in terrific proximity and like an enormous
pyramid threw its shadow over the clouds rolling beneath our feet

about three in the morning by the sombrous light of a few fir
torches we started on our journey to the summit of the piton we
scaled the volcano on the north-east side where the declivities
are extremely steep and after two hours' toil we reached a small
plain which on account of its elevated position bears the name
of alta vista this is the station of the neveros those natives
whose occupation it is to collect ice and snow which they sell in
the neighbouring towns their mules better practised in climbing
mountains than those hired by travellers reach alta vista and the
neveros are obliged to transport the snow to that place on their
backs above this point commences the malpays a term by which is
designated here as well as in mexico peru and every other
country subject to volcanoes a ground destitute of vegetable
mould and covered with fragments of lava

we turned to the right to examine the cavern of ice which is at
the elevation of 1728 toises consequently below the limit of the
perpetual snows in this zone probably the cold which prevails in
this cavern is owing to the same causes which perpetuate the ice
in the crevices of mount jura and the apennines and on which the
opinions of naturalists are still much divided this natural
ice-house of the peak has nevertheless none of those
perpendicular openings which give emission to the warm air while
the cold air remains undisturbed at the bottom it would seem that
the ice is preserved in it on account of its mass and because its
melting is retarded by the cold which is the consequence of quick
evaporation this small subterraneous glacier is situated in a
region the mean temperature of which is probably not under three
degrees and it is not like the true glaciers of the alps fed by
the snow waters that flow from the summits of the mountains during
winter the cavern is filled with ice and snow and as the rays of
the sun do not penetrate beyond the mouth the heats of summer are
not sufficient to empty the reservoir the existence of a natural
ice-house depends consequently rather on the quantity of snow
which enters it in winter and the small influence of the warm
winds in summer than on the absolute elevation of the cavity and
the mean temperature of the layer of air in which it is situated
the air contained in the interior of a mountain is not easily
displaced as is exemplified by monte testaccio at rome the
temperature of which is so different from that of the surrounding
atmosphere on chimborazo enormous heaps of ice are found covered
with sand and in the same manner as at the peak far below the
inferior limit of the perpetual snows

it was near the ice-cavern (cueva del hielo) that in the voyage
of laperouse messrs lamanon and monges made their experiments on
the temperature of boiling water these naturalists found it 887
degrees the barometer at nineteen inches one line in the kingdom
of new grenada at the chapel of guadaloupe near santa-fe de
bogota i have seen water boil at 899 degrees under a pressure of
19 inches 19 lines at tambores in the province of popayan senor
caldas found the heat of boiling water 895 degrees the barometer
being at 18 inches 116 lines these results might lead us to
suspect that in the experiment of m lamanon the water had not
reached the maximum of its temperature

day was beginning to dawn when we left the ice-cavern we observed
during the twilight a phenomenon which is not unusual on high
mountains but which the position of the volcano we were scaling
rendered very striking a layer of white and fleecy clouds
concealed from us the sight of the ocean and the lower region of
the island this layer did not appear above 800 toises high the
clouds were so uniformly spread and kept so perfect a level that
they wore the appearance of a vast plain covered with snow the
colossal pyramid of the peak the volcanic summits of lancerota of
forteventura and the isle of palma were like rocks amidst this
vast sea of vapours and their black tints were in fine contrast
with the whiteness of the clouds

while we were climbing over the broken lavas of the malpays we
perceived a very curious optical phenomenon which lasted eight
minutes we thought we saw on the east side small rockets thrown
into the air luminous points about seven or eight degrees above
the horizon appeared first to move in a vertical direction but
their motion was gradually changed into a horizontal oscillation
our fellow-travellers our guides even were astonished at this
phenomenon without our having made any remark on it to them we
thought at first sight that these luminous points which floated
in the air indicated some new eruption of the great volcano of
lancerota for we recollected that bouguer and la condamine in
scaling the volcano of pichincha were witnesses of the eruption of
cotopaxi but the illusion soon ceased and we found that the
luminous points were the images of several stars magnified by the
vapours these images remained motionless at intervals they then
seemed to rise perpendicularly descended sideways and returned to
the point whence they had departed this motion lasted one or two
seconds though we had no exact means of measuring the extent of
the lateral shifting we did not the less distinctly observe the
path of the luminous point it did not appear double from an effect
of mirage and left no trace of light behind bringing with the
telescope of a small sextant by troughton the stars into contact
with the lofty summit of a mountain in lancerota i observed that
the oscillation was constantly directed towards the same point
that is to say towards that part of the horizon where the disk of
the sun was to appear and that making allowance for the motion of
the star in its declination the image returned always to the same
place these appearances of lateral refraction ceased long before
daylight rendered the stars quite invisible i have faithfully
related what we saw during the twilight without undertaking to
explain this extraordinary phenomenon of which i published an
account in baron zach's astronomical journal twelve years ago the
motion of the vesicular vapours caused by the rising of the sun
the mingling of several layers of air the temperature and density
of which were very different no doubt contributed to produce an
apparent movement of the stars in the horizontal direction we see
something similar in the strong undulations of the solar disk when
it cuts the horizon but these undulations seldom exceed twenty
seconds while the lateral motion of the stars observed at the
peak at more than 1800 toises was easily distinguished by the
naked eye and seemed to exceed all that we have thought it
possible to consider hitherto as the effect of the refraction of
the light of the stars on the top of the andes at antisana i
observed the sun-rise and passed the whole night at the height of
2100 toises without noting any appearance resembling this
phenomenon

i was anxious to make an exact observation of the instant of
sun-rising at an elevation so considerable as that we had reached
on the peak of teneriffe no traveller furnished with instruments
had as yet taken such an observation i had a telescope and a
chronometer which i knew to be exceedingly correct in the part
where the sun was to appear the horizon was free from vapour we
perceived the upper limb at 4 hours 48 minutes 55 seconds apparent
time and what is very remarkable the first luminous point of the
disk appeared immediately in contact with the limit of the horizon
consequently we saw the true horizon that is to say a part of the
sea farther distant than 43 leagues it is proved by calculation
that under the same parallel in the plain the rising would have
begun at 5 hours 1 minute 504 seconds or 11 minutes 513 seconds
later than at the height of the peak the difference observed was
12 minutes 55 seconds which arose no doubt from the uncertainty of
the refraction for a zenith distance of which observations are
wanting

we were surprised at the extreme slowness with which the lower limb
of the sun seemed to detach itself from the horizon this limb was
not visible till 4 hours 56 minutes 56 seconds the disc of the
sun much flattened was well defined during the ascent there was
neither double image nor lengthening of the lower limb the
duration of the sun's rising being triple that which we might have
expected in this latitude we must suppose that a fog-bank very
uniformly extended concealed the true horizon and followed the
sun in its ascent notwithstanding the libration of the stars*
which we had observed towards the east we could not attribute the
slowness of the rising to an extraordinary refraction of the rays
occasioned by the horizon of the sea for it is precisely at the
rising of the sun as le gentil daily observed at pondicherry and
as i have several times remarked at cumana that the horizon sinks
on account of the elevation of temperature in the stratum of the
air which lies immediately over the surface of the ocean (* a
celebrated astronomer baron zach has compared this phenomenon of
an apparent libration of the stars to that described in the
georgics (lib 50 v 365) but this passage relates only to the
falling stars which the ancients (like the mariners of modern
times) considered as a prognostic of wind)

the road which we were obliged to clear for ourselves across the
malpays was extremely fatiguing the ascent is steep and the
blocks of lava rolled from beneath our feet i can compare this
part of the road only to the moraine of the alps or that mass of
pebbly stones which we find at the lower extremity of the glaciers
at the peak the lava broken into sharp pieces leaves hollows in
which we risked falling up to our waists unfortunately the
listlessness of our guides contributed to increase the difficulty
of this ascent unlike the guides of the valley of chamouni or the
nimble-footed guanches who could it is asserted seize the rabbit
or wild goat in its course our canarian guides were models of the
phlegmatic they had wished to persuade us on the preceding evening
not to go beyond the station of the rocks every ten minutes they
sat down to rest themselves and when unobserved they threw away
the specimens of obsidian and pumice-stone which we had carefully
collected we discovered at length that none of them had ever
visited the summit of the volcano

after three hours' walking we reached at the extremity of the
malpays a small plain called la rambleta from the centre of
which the piton or sugar-loaf takes its rise on the side toward
orotava the mountain resembles those pyramids with steps that are
seen at fayoum and in mexico for the elevated plains of retama and
rambleta form two tiers the first of which is four times higher
than the second if we suppose the total height of the peak to be
1904 toises the rambleta is 1820 toises above the level of the
sea here are found those spiracles which are called by the
natives the nostrils of the peak (narices del pico) watery and
heated vapours issue at intervals from several crevices in the
ground and the thermometer rose to 432 degrees m labillardiere
had found the temperature of these vapours eight years before us
537 degrees a difference which does not perhaps prove so much a
diminution of activity in the volcano as a local change in the
heating of its internal surface the vapours have no smell and
seem to be pure water a short time before the great eruption of
mount vesuvius in 1805 m gay-lussac and myself had observed that
water under the form of vapour in the interior of the crater did
not redden paper which had been dipped in syrup of violets i
cannot however admit the bold hypothesis according to which the
nostrils of the peak are to be considered as the vents of an
immense apparatus of distillation the lower part of which is
situated below the level of the sea since the time when volcanoes
have been carefully studied and the love of the marvellous has
been less apparent in works on geology well founded doubts have
been raised respecting these direct and constant communications
between the waters of the sea and the focus of the volcanic fire*
(* this question has been examined with much sagacity by m
brieslak in his "introduzzione alla geologia" tome 2 pages 302
323 347 cotopaxi and popocatepetl which i saw ejecting smoke and
ashes in 1804 are farther from both the pacific and the gulf of
the antilles than grenoble is from the mediterranean and orleans
from the atlantic we must not consider the fact as merely
accidental that we have not yet discovered an active volcano more
than 40 leagues distant from the ocean but i consider the
hypothesis that the waters of the sea are absorbed distilled and
decomposed by volcanoes as very doubtful) we may find a very
simple explanation of a phenomenon that has in it nothing very
surprising the peak is covered with snow during part of the year
we ourselves found it still so in the plain of rambleta messrs
o'donnel and armstrong discovered in 1806 a very abundant spring in
the malpays a hundred toises above the cavern of ice which is
perhaps fed partly by this snow everything consequently leads us
to presume that the peak of teneriffe like the volcanoes of the
andes and those of the island of manilla contains within itself
great cavities which are filled with atmospherical water owing
merely to filtration the aqueous vapours exhaled by the narices
and crevices of the crater are only those same waters heated by
the interior surfaces down which they flow

we had yet to scale the steepest part of the mountain the piton
which forms the summit the slope of this small cone covered with
volcanic ashes and fragments of pumice-stone is so steep that it
would have been almost impossible to reach the top had we not
ascended by an old current of lava the debris of which have
resisted the ravages of time these debris form a wall of scorious
rock which stretches into the midst of the loose ashes we
ascended the piton by grasping these half-decomposed scoriae which
often broke in our hands we employed nearly half an hour to scale
a hill the perpendicular height of which is scarcely ninety
toises vesuvius three times lower than the peak of teneriffe is
terminated by a cone of ashes almost three times higher but with a
more accessible and easy slope of all the volcanoes which i have
visited that of jorullo in mexico is the only one that is more
difficult to climb than the peak because the whole mountain is
covered with loose ashes

when the sugar-loaf (el piton) is covered with snow as it is in
the beginning of winter the steepness of its declivity may be very
dangerous to the traveller m le gros showed us the place where
captain baudin was nearly killed when he visited the peak of
teneriffe that officer had the courage to undertake in company
with the naturalists advenier mauger and riedle an excursion to
the top of the volcano about the end of december 1797 having
reached half the height of the cone he fell and rolled down as
far as the small plain of rambleta happily a heap of lava covered
with snow hindered him from rolling farther with accelerated
velocity i have been told that in switzerland a traveller was
suffocated by rolling down the declivity of the col de balme over
the compact turf of the alps

when we gained the summit of the piton we were surprised to find
scarcely room enough to seat ourselves conveniently we were
stopped by a small circular wall of porphyritic lava with a base
of pitchstone which concealed from us the view of the crater* (*
called la caldera or the caldron of the peak a denomination which
recalls to mind the oules of the pyrenees) the west wind blew with
such violence that we could scarcely stand it was eight in the
morning and we suffered severely from the cold though the
thermometer kept a little above freezing point for a long time we
had been accustomed to a very high temperature and the dry wind
increased the feeling of cold because it carried off every moment
the small atmosphere of warm and humid air which was formed around
us from the effect of cutaneous perspiration

the brink of the crater of the peak bears no resemblance to those
of most of the other volcanoes which i have visited for instance
the craters of vesuvius jorullo and pichincha in these the piton
preserves its conic figure to the very summit the whole of their
declivity is inclined the same number of degrees and uniformly
covered with a layer of pumice-stone very minutely divided when we
reach the top of these volcanoes nothing obstructs the view of the
bottom of the crater the peaks of teneriffe and cotopaxi on the
contrary are of very different construction at their summit a
circular wall surrounds the crater which wall at a distance has
the appearance of a small cylinder placed on a truncated cone on
cotopaxi this peculiar construction is visible to the naked eye at
more than 2000 toises distance and no person has ever reached the
crater of that volcano on the peak of teneriffe the wall which
surrounds the crater like a parapet is so high that it would be
impossible to reach the caldera if on the eastern side there was
not a breach which seems to have been the effect of a flowing of
very old lava we descended through this breach toward the bottom
of the funnel the figure of which is elliptic its greater axis
has a direction from north-west to south-east nearly north 35
degrees west the greatest breadth of the mouth appeared to us to
be 300 feet the smallest 200 feet which numbers agree very nearly
with the measurement of mm verguin varela and borda

it is easy to conceive that the size of a crater does not depend
solely on the height and mass of the mountain of which it forms
the principal air-vent this opening is indeed seldom in direct
ratio with the intensity of the volcanic fire or with the activity
of the volcano at vesuvius which is but a hill compared with the
peak of teneriffe the diameter of the crater is five times
greater when we reflect that very lofty volcanoes throw out less
matter from their summits than from lateral openings we should be
led to think that the lower the volcanoes their force and
activity being the same the more considerable ought to be their
craters in fact there are immense volcanoes in the andes which
have but very small openings and we might establish as a
geological principle that the most colossal mountains have craters
of little extent at the summits if the cordilleras did not present
many instances to the contrary* (* the great volcanoes of cotopaxi
and rucupichincha have craters the diameters of which according
to my measurements exceed 400 and 700 toises) i shall have
occasion in the progress of this work to cite a number of facts
which will throw some light on what may be called the external
structure of volcanoes this structure is as varied as the volcanic
phenomena themselves and in order to raise ourselves to geological
conceptions worthy of the greatness of nature we must set aside
the idea that all volcanoes are formed after the model of vesuvius
stromboli and etna

the external edges of the caldera are almost perpendicular their
appearance is somewhat like the somma seen from the atrio dei
cavalli we descended to the bottom of the crater on a train of
broken lava from the eastern breach of the enclosure the heat was
perceptible only in a few crevices which gave vent to aqueous
vapours with a peculiar buzzing noise some of these funnels or
crevices are on the outside of the enclosure on the external brink
of the parapet that surrounds the crater we plunged the
thermometer into them and saw it rise rapidly to 68 and 75
degrees it no doubt indicated a higher temperature but we could
not observe the instrument till we had drawn it up lest we should
burn our hands m cordier found several crevices the heat of
which was that of boiling water it might be thought that these
vapours which are emitted in gusts contain muriatic or sulphurous
acid but when condensed they have no particular taste and
experiments which have been made with re-agents prove that the
chimneys of the peak exhale only pure water this phenomenon
analogous to that which i observed in the crater of jorullo
deserves the more attention as muriatic acid abounds in the
greater part of volcanoes and as m vauquelin has discovered it
even in the porphyritic lavas of sarcouy in auvergne

i sketched on the spot a view of the interior edge of the crater
as it presented itself in the descent by the eastern break nothing
is more striking than the manner in which these strata of lava are
piled on one another exhibiting the sinuosities of the calcareous
rock of the higher alps these enormous ledges sometimes
horizontal sometimes inclined and undulating are indicative of
the ancient fluidity of the whole mass and of the combination of
several deranging causes which have determined the direction of
each flow the top of the circular wall exhibits those curious
ramifications which we find in coke the northern edge is most
elevated towards the south-west the enclosure is considerably sunk
and an enormous mass of scorious lava seems glued to the extremity
of the brink on the west the rock is perforated and a large
opening gives a view of the horizon of the sea the force of the
elastic vapours perhaps formed this natural aperture at the time
of some inundation of lava thrown out from the crater

the inside of this funnel indicates a volcano which for thousands
of years has vomited no fire but from its sides this conclusion is
not founded on the absence of great openings which might be
expected in the bottom of the caldera those whose experience is
founded on personal observation know that several volcanoes in
the intervals of an eruption appear filled up and almost
extinguished but that in these same mountains the crater of the
volcano exhibits layers of scoriae rough sonorous and shining
we observe hillocks and intumescences caused by the action of the
elastic vapours cones of broken scoriae and ashes which cover the
funnels none of these phenomena characterise the crater of the
peak of teneriffe its bottom is not in the state which ensues at
the close of an eruption from the lapse of time and the action of
the vapours the inside walls are detached and have covered the
basin with great blocks of lithoid lavas

the bottom of the caldera is reached without danger in a volcano
the activity of which is principally directed towards the summit
such as vesuvius the depth of the crater varies before and after
each eruption but at the peak of teneriffe the depth appears to
have remained unchanged for a long time eden in 1715 estimated
it at 115 feet cordier in 1803 at 110 feet judging by mere
inspection i should have thought the funnel of still less depth
its present state is that of a solfatara and it is rather an
object of curious investigation than of imposing aspect the
majesty of the site consists in its elevation above the level of
the sea in the profound solitude of these lofty regions and in
the immense space over which the eye ranges from the summit of the
mountain

the wall of compact lava forming the enclosure of the caldera is
snow-white at its surface the same colour prevails in the inside
of the solfatara of puzzuoli when we break these lavas which
might be taken at some distance for calcareous stone we find in
them a blackish brown nucleus porphyry with basis of pitch-stone
is whitened externally by the slow action of the vapours of
sulphurous acid gas these vapours rise in abundance and what is
rather remarkable through crevices which seem to have no
communication with the apertures that emit aqueous vapours we may
be convinced of the presence of the sulphurous acid by examining
the fine crystals of sulphur which are everywhere found in the
crevices of the lava this acid combined with the water with which
the soil is impregnated is transformed into sulphuric acid by
contact with the oxygen of the atmosphere in general the humidity
in the crater of the peak is more to be feared than the heat and
they who seat themselves for a while on the ground find their
clothes corroded the porphyritic lavas are affected by the action
of the sulphuric acid the alumine magnesia soda and metallic
oxides gradually disappear and often nothing remains but the
silex which unites in mammillary plates like opal these
siliceous concretions* (* opalartiger kieselsinter the siliceous
gurh of the volcanoes of the isle of france contains according to
klaproth 072 silex and 021 water and thus comes near to opal
which karsten considers as a hydrated silex) which m cordier
first made known are similar to those found in the isle of ischia
in the extinguished volcanoes of santa fiora and in the solfatara
of puzzuoli it is not easy to form an idea of the origin of these
incrustations the aqueous vapours discharged through great
spiracles do not contain alkali in solution like the waters of
the geyser in iceland perhaps the soda contained in the lavas of
the peak acts an important part in the formation of these deposits
of silex there may exist in the crater small crevices the vapours
of which are not of the same nature as those on which travellers
whose attention has been directed simultaneously to a great number
of objects have made experiments

seated on the northern brink of the crater i dug a hole of some
inches in depth and the thermometer placed in this hole rose
rapidly to 42 degrees hence we may conclude what must be the heat
in this solfatara at the depth of thirty or forty fathoms the
sulphur reduced into vapour is condensed into fine crystals which
however are not equal in size to those m dolomieu brought from
sicily they are semi-diaphanous octahedrons very brilliant on the
surface and of a conchoidal fracture these masses which will one
day perhaps be objects of commerce are constantly bedewed with
sulphurous acid i had the imprudence to wrap up a few in order to
preserve them but i soon discovered that the acid had consumed not
only the paper which contained them but a part also of my
mineralogical journal the heat of the vapours which issue from
the crevices of the caldera is not sufficiently great to combine
the sulphur while in a state of minute division with the oxygen of
the atmospheric air and after the experiment i have just cited on
the temperature of the soil we may presume that the sulphurous
acid is formed at a certain depth* in cavities to which the
external air has free access (* an observer in general very
accurate m breislack asserts that the muriatic acid always
predominates in the vapours of vesuvius this assertion is contrary
to what m gay-lussac and myself observed before the great
eruption of 1805 and while the lava was issuing from the crater
the smell of the sulphurous acid so easy to distinguish was
perceptible at a great distance and when the volcano threw out
scoriae the smell was mingled with that of petroleum)

the vapours of heated water which act on the fragments of lava
scattered about on the caldera reduce certain parts of it to a
state of paste on examining after i had reached america those
earthy and friable masses i found crystals of sulphate of alumine
mm davy and gay-lussac have already made the ingenious remark
that two bodies highly inflammable the metals of soda and potash
have probably an important part in the action of a volcano now the
potash necessary to the formation of alum is found not only in
feldspar mica pumice-stone and augite but also in obsidian
this last substance is very common at teneriffe where it forms the
basis of the tephrinic lava these analogies between the peak of
teneriffe and the solfatara of puzzuoli might no doubt be shown to
be more numerous if the former were more accessible and had been
frequently visited by naturalists

an expedition to the summit of the volcano of teneriffe is
interesting not solely on account of the great number of phenomena
which are the objects of scientific research it has still greater
attractions from the picturesque beauties which it lays open to
those who are feelingly alive to the majesty of nature it is a
difficult task to describe the sensations which are the more
forcible inasmuch as they have something undefined produced by
the immensity of the space as well as by the vastness the novelty
and the multitude of the objects amidst which we find ourselves
transported when a traveller attempts to describe the loftiest
summits of the globe the cataracts of the great rivers the
tortuous valleys of the andes he incurs the danger of fatiguing
his readers by the monotonous expression of his admiration it
appears to me more conformable to the plan i have proposed to
myself in this narrative to indicate the peculiar character that
distinguishes each zone we exhibit with more clearness the
physiognomy of the landscape in proportion as we endeavour to
sketch its individual features to compare them with each other
and to discover by this kind of analysis the sources of the
enjoyments furnished by the great picture of nature

travellers have learned by experience that views from the summits
of very lofty mountains are neither so beautiful picturesque nor
so varied as those from heights which do not exceed that of
vesuvius righi and the puy-de-dome colossal mountains such as
chimborazo antisana or mount rosa compose so large a mass that
the plains covered with rich vegetation are seen only in the
immensity of distance and a blue and vapoury tint is uniformly
spread over the landscape the peak of teneriffe from its slender
form and local position unites the advantages of less lofty
summits with those peculiar to very great heights we not only
discern from its top a vast expanse of sea but we perceive also
the forests of teneriffe and the inhabited parts of the coasts in
a proximity calculated to produce the most beautiful contrasts of
form and colour we might say that the volcano overwhelms with its
mass the little island which serves as its base and it shoots up
from the bosom of the waters to a height three times loftier than
the region where the clouds float in summer if its crater half
extinguished for ages past shot forth flakes of fire like that of
stromboli in the aeolian islands the peak of teneriffe like a
lighthouse would serve to guide the mariner in a circuit of more
than 260 leagues

when we were seated on the external edge of the crater we turned
our eyes towards the north-west where the coasts are studded with
villages and hamlets at our feet masses of vapour constantly
drifted by the winds afforded us the most variable spectacle a
uniform stratum of clouds similar to that already described and
which separated us from the lower regions of the island had been
pierced in several places by the effect of the small currents of
air which the earth heated by the sun began to send towards us
the port of orotava its vessels at anchor the gardens and the
vineyards encircling the town shewed themselves through an opening
which seemed to enlarge every instant from the summit of these
solitary regions our eyes wandered over an inhabited world we
enjoyed the striking contrast between the bare sides of the peak
its steep declivities covered with scoriae its elevated plains
destitute of vegetation and the smiling aspect of the cultured
country beneath we beheld the plants divided by zones as the
temperature of the atmosphere diminished with the elevation of the
site below the piton lichens begin to cover the scorious and
lustrous lava a violet* (* viola cheiranthifolia) akin to the
viola decumbens rises on the slope of the volcano at 1740 toises
of height it takes the lead not only of the other herbaceous
plants but even of the gramina which in the alps and on the
ridge of the cordilleras form close neighbourhood with the plants
of the family of the cryptogamia tufts of retama loaded with
flowers adorn the valleys hollowed out by the torrents and
encumbered with the effects of the lateral eruptions below the
retama lies the region of ferns bordered by the tract of the
arborescent heaths forests of laurel rhamnus and arbutus divide
the ericas from the rising grounds planted with vines and fruit
trees a rich carpet of verdure extends from the plain of spartium
and the zone of the alpine plants even to the groups of the date
tree and the musa at the feet of which the ocean appears to roll
i here pass slightly over the principal features of this botanical
chart as i shall enter hereafter into some farther details
respecting the geography of the plants of the island of teneriffe*
(* see below)

the seeming proximity in which from the summit of the peak we
behold the hamlets the vineyards and the gardens on the coast is
increased by the prodigious transparency of the atmosphere
notwithstanding the great distance we could distinguish not only
the houses the sails of the vessels and the trunks of the trees
but we could discern the vivid colouring of the vegetation of the
plains these phenomena are owing not only to the height of the
site but to the peculiar modifications of the air in warm
climates in every zone an object placed on a level with the sea
and viewed in a horizontal direction appears less luminous than
when seen from the top of a mountain where vapours arrive after
passing through strata of air of decreasing density differences
equally striking are produced by the influence of climate the
surface of a lake or large river is less resplendent when we see
it at an equal distance from the top of the higher alps of
switzerland than when we view it from the summit of the
cordilleras of peru or of mexico in proportion as the air is pure
and serene the solution of the vapours becomes more complete and
the light loses less in its passage when from the shores of the
pacific we ascend the elevated plain of quito or that of antisana
we are struck for some days by the nearness at which we imagine we
see objects which are actually seven or eight leagues distant the
peak of teyde has not the advantage of being situated in the
equinoctial region but the dryness of the columns of air which
rise perpetually above the neighbouring plains of africa and which
the eastern winds convey with rapidity gives to the atmosphere of
the canary islands a transparency which not only surpasses that of
the air of naples and sicily but perhaps exceeds the purity of the
sky of quito and peru this transparency may be regarded as one of
the chief causes of the beauty of landscape scenery in the torrid
zone it heightens the splendour of the vegetable colouring and
contributes to the magical effect of its harmonies and contrasts
if the mass of light which circulates about objects fatigues the
external senses during a part of the day the inhabitant of the
southern climates has his compensation in moral enjoyment a lucid
clearness in the conceptions and a serenity of mind correspond
with the transparency of the surrounding atmosphere we feel these
impressions without going beyond the boundaries of europe i appeal
to travellers who have visited countries rendered famous by the
great creations of the imagination and of art the favoured climes
of italy and greece

we prolonged in vain our stay on the summit of the peak awaiting
the moment when we might enjoy the view of the whole of the
archipelago of the fortunate islands* we however descried palma
gomera and the great canary at our feet (* of all the small
islands of the canaries the rock of the east is the only one which
cannot be seen even in fine weather from the top of the peak its
distance is 3 degrees 5 minutes while that of the salvage is only
2 degrees 1 minute the island of madeira distant 4 degrees 29
minutes would be visible if its mountains were more than 3000
toises high) the mountains of lancerota free from vapours at
sunrise were soon enveloped in thick clouds supposing only an
ordinary refraction the eye takes in in calm weather from the
summit of the volcano a surface of the globe of 5700 square
leagues equal to a fourth of the superficies of spain the
question has often been agitated whether it be possible to
perceive the coast of africa from the top of this colossal pyramid
but the nearest parts of that coast are still farther from
teneriffe than 2 degrees 49 minutes or 56 leagues the visual ray
of the horizon from the peak being 1 degree 57 minutes cape
bojador can be seen only on the supposition of its height being 200
toises above the level of the ocean we are ignorant of the height
of the black mountains near cape bojador as well as of that peak
called by navigators the penon grande farther to the south of this
promontory if the summit of the volcano of teneriffe were more
accessible we should observe without doubt in certain states of
the wind the effects of an extraordinary refraction on perusing
what spanish and portuguese authors relate respecting the existence
of the fabulous isle of san borondon or antilia we find that it
is particularly the humid wind from west-south-west which produces
in these latitudes the phenomena of the mirage we shall not
however admit with m vieyra "that the play of the terrestrial
refractions may render visible to the inhabitants of the canaries
the islands of cape verd and even the apalachian mountains of
america"* (* the american fruits frequently thrown by the sea on
the coasts of the islands of ferro and gomera were formerly
supposed to emanate from the plants of the island of san borondon
this island said to be governed by an archbishop and six bishops
and which father feijoa believed to be the image of the island of
ferro reflected on a fog-bank was ceded in the 16th century by
the king of portugal to lewis perdigon at the time the latter was
preparing to take possession of it by conquest)

the cold we felt on the top of the peak was very considerable for
the season the centigrade thermometer at a distance from the
ground and from the apertures that emitted the hot vapours fell
in the shade to 27 degrees the wind was west and consequently
opposite to that which brings to teneriffe during a great part of
the year the warm air that floats above the burning desert of
africa as the temperature of the atmosphere observed at the port
of orotava by m savagi was 228 degrees the decrement of caloric
was one degree every 94 toises this result perfectly corresponds
with those obtained by lamanon and saussure on the summits of the
peak and etna though in very different seasons the tall slender
form of these mountains facilitates the means of comparing the
temperature of two strata of the atmosphere which are nearly in
the same perpendicular plane and in this point of view the
observations made in an excursion to the volcano of teneriffe
resemble those of an ascent in a balloon we must nevertheless
remark that the ocean on account of its transparency and
evaporation reflects less caloric than the plains into the upper
regions of the air and also that summits which are surrounded by
the sea are colder in summer than mountains which rise from a
continent but this circumstance has very little influence on the
decrement of atmospherical heat the temperature of the low regions
being equally diminished by the proximity of the ocean

it is not the same with respect to the influence exercised by the
direction of the wind and the rapidity of the ascending current
the latter sometimes increases in an astonishing manner the
temperature of the loftiest mountains i have seen the thermometer
rise on the slope of the volcano of antisana in the kingdom of
quito to 19 degrees when we were 2837 toises high m
labillardiere has seen it on the edge of the crater of the peak of
teneriffe at 187 degrees though he had used every possible
precaution to avoid the effect of accidental causes

on the summit of the peak we beheld with admiration the azure
colour of the sky its intensity at the zenith appeared to
correspond to 41 degrees of the cyanometer we know by saussure's
experiment that this intensity increases with the rarity of the
air and that the same instrument marked at the same period 39
degrees at the priory of chamouni and 40 degrees at the top of
mont blanc this last mountain is 540 toises higher than the
volcano of teneriffe and if notwithstanding this difference the
sky is observed there to be of a less deep blue we must attribute
this phenomenon to the dryness of the african air and the
proximity of the torrid zone

we collected on the brink of the crater some air which we meant to
analyse on our voyage to america the phial remained so well
corked that on opening it ten days after the water rushed in with
impetuosity several experiments made by means of nitrous gas in
the narrow tube of fontana's eudiometer seemed to prove that the
air of the crater contained 009 degrees less oxygen than the air
of the sea but i have little confidence in this result obtained by
means which we now consider as very inexact the crater of the peak
has so little depth and the air is renewed with so much facility
that it is scarcely probable the quantity of azote is greater there
than on the coasts we know also from the experiments of mm
gay-lussac and theodore de saussure that in the highest as well as
in the lowest regions of the atmosphere the air equally contains
021 of oxygen* (* during the stay of m gay-lussac and myself at
the hospice of mont cenis in march 1805 we collected air in the
midst of a cloud loaded with electricity this air analysed in
volta's eudiometer contained no hydrogen and its purity did not
differ 0002 of oxygen from the air of paris which we had carried
with us in phials hermetically sealed)

we saw on the summit of the peak no trace of psora lecidea or
other cryptogamous plants no insect fluttered in the air we found
however a few hymenoptera adhering to masses of sulphur moistened
with sulphurous acid and lining the mouths of the funnels these
are bees which appear to have been attracted by the flowers of the
spartium nubigenum and which oblique currents of air had carried
up to these high regions like the butterflies found by m ramond
at the top of mont perdu the butterflies perished from cold while
the bees on the peak were scorched on imprudently approaching the
crevices where they came in search of warmth

notwithstanding the heat we felt in our feet on the edge of the
crater the cone of ashes remains covered with snow during several
months in winter it is probable that under the cap of snow
considerable hollows are found like those existing under the
glaciers of switzerland the temperature of which is constantly
less elevated than that of the soil on which they repose the cold
and violent wind which blew from the time of sunrise induced us
to seek shelter at the foot of the piton our hands and faces were
nearly frozen while our boots were burnt by the soil on which we
walked we descended in the space of a few minutes the sugar-loaf
which we had scaled with so much toil and this rapidity was in
part involuntary for we often rolled down on the ashes it was
with regret that we quitted this solitude this domain where nature
reigns in all her majesty we consoled ourselves with the hope of
once again visiting the canary islands but this like many other
plans we then formed has never been executed

we traversed the malpays but slowly for the foot finds no sure
foundation on the loose blocks of lava nearer the station of the
rocks the descent becomes extremely difficult the compact
short-swarded turf is so slippery that we were obliged to incline
our bodies continually backward in order to avoid falling in the
sandy plain of retama the thermometer rose to 225 degrees and
this heat seemed to us suffocating in comparison with the cold
which we had suffered from the air on the summit of the volcano we
were absolutely without water our guides not satisfied with
drinking clandestinely the little supply of malmsey wine for which
we were indebted to don cologan's kindness had broken our water
jars happily the bottle which contained the air of the crater
escaped unhurt

we at length enjoyed the refreshing breeze in the beautiful region
of the arborescent erica and fern and we were enveloped in a thick
bed of clouds stationary at six hundred toises above the plain the
clouds having dispersed we remarked a phenomenon which afterwards
became familiar to us on the declivities of the cordilleras small
currents of air chased trains of cloud with unequal velocity and
in opposite directions they bore the appearance of streamlets of
water in rapid motion and flowing in all directions amidst a great
mass of stagnant water the causes of this partial motion of the
clouds are probably very various we may suppose them to arise from
some impulsion at a great distance from the slight inequalities of
the soil which reflects in a greater or less degree the radiant
heat from a difference of temperature kept up by some chemical
action or perhaps from a strong electric charge of the vesicular
vapours

as we approached the town of orotava we met great flocks of
canaries* (* fringilla canaria la caille relates in the
narrative of his voyage to the cape that on salvage island these
canaries are so abundant that you cannot walk there in a certain
season without breaking their eggs) these birds well known in
europe were in general uniformly green some however had a
yellow tinge on their backs their note was the same as that of the
tame canary it is nevertheless remarked that those which have
been taken in the island of the great canary and in the islet of
monte clara near lancerota have a louder and at the same time a
more harmonious song in every zone among birds of the same
species each flock has its peculiar note the yellow canaries are
a variety which has taken birth in europe and those we saw in
cages at orotava and santa cruz had been bought at cadiz and in
other ports of spain but of all the birds of the canary islands
that which has the most heart-soothing song is unknown in europe
it is the capirote which no effort has succeeded in taming so
sacred to his soul is liberty i have stood listening in admiration
of his soft and melodious warbling in a garden at orotava but i
have never seen him sufficiently near to ascertain to what family
he belongs as to the parrots which were supposed to have been
seen at the period of captain cook's abode at teneriffe they never
existed but in the narratives of a few travellers who have copied
from each other neither parrots nor monkeys inhabit the canary
islands and though in the new continent the former migrate as far
as north carolina i doubt whether in the old they have ever been
met with beyond the 28th degree of north latitude

toward the close of day we reached the port of orotava where we
received the unexpected intelligence that the pizarro would not set
sail till the 24th or 25th if we could have calculated on this
delay we should either have lengthened our stay on the peak* or
have made an excursion to the volcano of chahorra (* as a great
number of travellers who land at santa cruz do not undertake the
excursion to the peak because they are ignorant of the time it
occupies it may be useful to lay down the following data in
making use of mules as far as the estancia de los ingleses it
takes twenty-one hours from orotava to arrive at the summit of the
peak and return to the port namely from orotava to the pino del
dornajito three hours from the pino to the station of the rocks
six hours and from this station to the caldera three hours and a
half i reckon nine hours for the descent in this calculation i
count only the time employed in walking without reckoning that
which is necessary for examining the productions of the peak or
for taking rest half a day is sufficient for going from santa cruz
to orotava) we passed the following day in visiting the environs
of orotava and enjoying the agreeable company we found at don
cologan's we perceived that teneriffe had attractions not only to
those who devote themselves to the study of nature we found at
orotava several persons possessing a taste for literature and
music and who have transplanted into these distant climes the
amenity of european society in these respects the canary islands
have no great resemblance to the other spanish colonies excepting
the havannah

we were present on the eve of st john at a pastoral fete in the
garden of mr little this gentleman who rendered great service to
the canarians during the last famine has cultivated a hill covered
with volcanic substances he has formed in this delicious site an
english garden whence there is a magnificent view of the peak of
the villages along the coast and the isle of palma which is
bounded by the vast expanse of the atlantic i cannot compare this
prospect with any except the views of the bays of genoa and
naples but orotava is greatly superior to both in the magnitude of
the masses and in the richness of vegetation in the beginning of
the evening the slope of the volcano exhibited on a sudden a most
extraordinary spectacle the shepherds in conformity to a custom
no doubt introduced by the spaniards though it dates from the
highest antiquity had lighted the fires of st john the scattered
masses of fire and the columns of smoke driven by the wind formed
a fine contrast with the deep verdure of the forests which covered
the sides of the peak shouts of joy resounding from afar were the
only sounds that broke the silence of nature in these solitary
regions

don cologan's family has a country-house nearer the coast than that
i have just mentioned this house called la paz is connected with
a circumstance that rendered it peculiarly interesting to us m de
borda whose death we deplored was its inmate during his last
visit to the canary islands it was in a neighbouring plain that he
measured the base by which he determined the height of the peak
in this geometrical operation the great dracaena of orotava served
as a mark should any well-informed traveller at some future day
undertake a new measurement of the volcano with more exactness and
by the help of astronomical repeating circles he ought to measure
the base not near orotava but near los silos at a place called
bante according to m broussonnet there is no plain near the peak
of greater extent in herborizing near la paz we found a great
quantity of lichen roccella on the basaltic rocks bathed by the
waters of the sea the archil of the canaries is a very ancient
branch of commerce this lichen is however found in less abundance
in the island of teneriffe than in the desert islands of salvage
la graciosa and alegranza or even in canary and hierro we left
the port of orotava on the 24th of june

to avoid disconnecting the narrative of the excursion to the top of
the peak i have said nothing of the geological observations i made
on the structure of this colossal mountain and on the nature of
the volcanic rocks of which it is composed before we quit the
archipelago of the canaries i shall linger for a moment and bring
into one point of view some facts relating to the physical aspect
of those countries

mineralogists who think that the end of the geology of volcanoes is
the classification of lavas the examination of the crystals they
contain and their description according to their external
characters are generally very well satisfied when they come back
from the mouth of a burning volcano they return loaded with those
numerous collections which are the principal objects of their
research this is not the feeling of those who without confounding
descriptive mineralogy (oryctognosy) with geognosy endeavour to
raise themselves to ideas generally interesting and seek in the
study of nature for answers to the following questions 

is the conical mountain of a volcano entirely formed of liquified
matter heaped together by successive eruptions or does it contain
in its centre a nucleus of primitive rocks covered with lava which
are these same rocks altered by fire? what are the affinities which
unite the productions of modern volcanoes with the basalts the
phonolites and those porphyries with bases of feldspar which are
without quartz and which cover the cordilleras of peru and mexico
as well as the small groups of the monts dores of cantal and of
mezen in france? has the central nucleus of volcanoes been heated
in its primitive position and raised up in a softened state by
the force of the elastic vapours before these fluids communicated
by means of a crater with the external air? what is the substance
which for thousands of years keeps up this combustion sometimes
so slow and at other times so active? does this unknown cause act
at an immense depth or does this chemical action take place in
secondary rocks lying on granite?

the farther we are from finding a solution of these problems in the
numerous works hitherto published on etna and vesuvius the greater
is the desire of the traveller to see with his own eyes he hopes
to be more fortunate than those who have preceded him he wishes to
form a precise idea of the geological relations which the volcano
and the neighbouring mountains bear to each other but how often is
he disappointed when on the limits of the primitive soil
enormous banks of tufa and puzzolana render every observation on
the position and stratification impossible we reach the inside of
the crater with less difficulty than we at first expect we examine
the cone from its summit to its base we are struck with the
difference in the produce of each eruption and with the analogy
which still exists between the lavas of the same volcano but
notwithstanding the care with which we interrogate nature and the
number of partial observations which present themselves at every
step we return from the summit of a burning volcano less satisfied
than when we were preparing to visit it it is after we have
studied them on the spot that the volcanic phenomena appear still
more isolated more variable more obscure than we imagine them
when consulting the narratives of travellers

these reflections occurred to me on descending from the summit of
the peak of teneriffe the first unextinct volcano i had yet
visited they returned anew whenever in south america or in
mexico i had occasion to examine volcanic mountains when we
reflect how little the labours of mineralogists and the
discoveries in chemistry have promoted the knowledge of the
physical geology of mountains we cannot help being affected with a
painful sentiment and this is felt still more strongly by those
who studying nature in different climates are more occupied by
the problems they have not been able to solve than with the few
results they have obtained

the peak of ayadyrma or of echeyde* (* the word echeyde which
signifies hell in the language of the guanches has been corrupted
by the europeans into teyde) is a conic and isolated mountain
which rises in an islet of very small circumference those who do
not take into consideration the whole surface of the globe
believe that these three circumstances are common to the greater
part of volcanoes they cite in support of their opinion etna
the peak of the azores the solfatara of guadaloupe the
trois-salazes of the isle of bourbon and the clusters of volcanoes
in the indian sea and in the atlantic in europe and in asia as
far as the interior of the latter continent is known no burning
volcano is situated in the chains of mountains all being at a
greater or less distance from those chains in the new world on
the contrary (and this fact deserves the greatest attention) the
volcanoes the most stupendous for their masses form a part of the
cordilleras themselves the mountains of mica-slate and gneiss in
peru and new grenada immediately touch the volcanic porphyries of
the provinces of quito and pasto to the south and north of these
countries in chile and in the kingdom of guatimala the active
volcanoes are grouped in rows they are the continuation as we may
say of the chains of primitive rocks and if the volcanic fire has
broken forth in some plain remote from the cordilleras as in mount
sangay and jorullo* (* two volcanoes of the provinces of quixos
and mechoacan the one in the southern and the other in the
northern hemisphere) we must consider this phenomenon as an
exception to the law which nature seems to have imposed on these
regions i may here repeat these geological facts because this
presumed isolated situation of every volcano has been cited in
opposition to the idea that the peak of teneriffe and the other
volcanic summits of the canary islands are the remains of a
submerged chain of mountains the observations which have been made
on the grouping of volcanoes in america prove that the ancient
state of things represented in the conjectural map of the atlantic
by m bory de st vincent* (* whether the traditions of the
ancients respecting the atlantis are founded on historical facts
is a matter totally distinct from the question whether the
archipelago of the canaries and the adjacent islands are the
vestiges of a chain of mountains rent and sunk in the sea during
one of the great convulsions of our globe i do not pretend to form
any opinion in favour of the existence of the atlantis but i
endeavour to prove that the canaries have no more been created by
volcanoes than the whole body of the smaller antilles has been
formed by madrepores) is by no means contradictory to the
acknowledged laws of nature and that nothing opposes the
supposition that the summits of porto santo madeira and the
fortunate islands may heretofore have formed either a distinct
range of primitive mountains or the western extremity of the chain
of the atlas

the peak of teyde forms a pyramidal mass like etna tungurahua and
popocatepetl this physiognomic character is very far from being
common to all volcanoes we have seen some in the southern
hemisphere which instead of having the form of a cone or a bell
are lengthened in one direction having the ridge sometimes smooth
and at others bristled with small pointed rocks this structure is
peculiar to antisana and pichincha two burning mountains of the
province of quito and the absence of the conic form ought never to
be considered as a reason excluding the idea of a volcanic origin
i shall develop in the progress of this work some of the
analogies which i think i have perceived between the physiognomy
of volcanoes and the antiquity of their rocks it is sufficient to
state generally speaking that the summits which are still
subject to eruptions of the greatest violence and at the nearest
periods to each other are slender peaks of a conic form that the
mountains with lengthened summits and rugged with small stony
masses are very old volcanoes and near being extinguished and
that rounded tops in the form of domes or bells indicate those
problematic porphyries which are supposed to have been heated in
their primitive position penetrated by vapours and forced up in a
mollified state without having ever flowed as real lithoidal
lavas to the first class belong cotopaxi the peak of teneriffe
and the peak of orizava in mexico in the second may be placed
cargueirazo and pichincha in the province of quito the volcano of
puracey near popayan and perhaps also hecla in iceland in the
third and last we may rank the majestic figure of chimborazo and
(if it be allowable to place by the side of that colossus a hill of
europe) the great sarcouy in auvergne

in order to form a more exact idea of the external structure of
volcanoes it is important to compare their perpendicular height
with their circumference this however cannot be done with any
exactness unless the mountains are isolated and rising on a plain
nearly on a level with the sea in calculating the circumference of
the peak of teneriffe in a curve passing through the port of
orotava garachico adexe and guimar and setting aside the
prolongations of its base towards the forest of laguna and the
north-east cape of the island we find that this extent is more
than 54000 toises the height of the peak is consequently one
twenty-eighth of the circumference of its basis m von buch found
a thirty-third for vesuvius and which perhaps is less certain a
thirty-fourth for etna* (* gilbert annalen der physik b 5 page
455 vesuvius is 133000 palmas or eighteen nautical miles in
circumference the horizontal distance from resina to the crater is
3700 toises italian mineralogists have estimated the circumference
of etna at 840000 palmas or 119 miles with these data the ratio
of the height to the circumference would be only a seventy-second
but i find on tracing a curve through catania palermo bronte and
piemonte only 62 miles in circumference according to the best
maps this increases the ratio to a fifty-fourth does the basis
fall on the outside of the curve that i assume?) if the slope of
these three volcanoes were uniform from the summit to the base the
peak of teyde would have an inclination of 12 degrees 29 minutes
vesuvius 12 degrees 41 minutes and etna 10 degrees 13 minutes a
result which must astonish those who do not reflect on what
constitutes an average slope in a very long ascent slopes of
three or four degrees alternate with others which are inclined from
25 to 30 degrees and the latter only strike our imagination because
we think all the slopes of mountains more steep than they really are
i may cite in support of this consideration the example of the
ascent from the port of vera cruz to the elevated plain of mexico
on the eastern slope of the cordillera a road has been traced
which for ages has not been frequented except on foot or on the
backs of mules from encero to the small indian village of las
vigas there are 7500 toises of horizontal distance and encero
being according to my barometric measurement 746 toises lower
than las vigas the result for the mean slope is only an angle of
5 degrees 40 minutes

in the following note will be seen the results of some experiments
i have made on the difficulties arising from the declivities in
mountainous countries*

(* in places where there were at the same time slopes covered with
tufted grass and loose sands i took the following measures 

  5 degrees slope of a very marked inclination in france the high
    roads must not exceed 4 degrees 46 minutes by law
 15 degrees slope extremely steep and which we cannot descend in a
    carriage
 37 degrees slope almost inaccessible on foot if the ground be
    naked rock or turf too thick to form steps the body falls
    backwards when the tibia makes a smaller angle than 53 degrees with
    the sole of the foot
 42 degrees the steepest slope that can be climbed on foot in a
    ground that is sandy or covered with volcanic ashes

when the slope is 44 degrees it is almost impossible to scale it
though the ground permits the forming of steps by thrusting in the
foot the cones of volcanoes have a medium slope from 33 to 40
degrees the steepest parts of these cones either of vesuvius the
peak of teneriffe the volcano of pichincha or jorullo are from
40 to 42 degrees a slope of 55 degrees is quite inaccessible if
seen from above it would be estimated at 75 degrees)

isolated volcanoes in the most distant regions are very analogous
in their structure at great elevations all have considerable
plains in the middle of which arises a cone perfectly circular
thus at cotopaxi the plains of suniguaicu extend beyond the farm of
pansache the stony summit of antisana covered with eternal snow
forms an islet in the midst of an immense plain the surface of
which is twelve leagues square while its height exceeds that of
the peak of teneriffe by two hundred toises at vesuvius at three
hundred and seventy toises high the cone detaches itself from the
plain of atrio dei cavalli the peak of teneriffe presents two of
these elevated plains the uppermost of which at the foot of the
piton is as high as etna and of very little extent while the
lowermost covered with tufts of retama reaches as far as the
estancia de los ingleses this rises above the level of the sea
almost as high as the city of quito and the summit of mount
lebanon

the greater the quantity of matter that has issued from the crater
of a mountain the more elevated is its cone of ashes in proportion
to the perpendicular height of the volcano itself nothing is more
striking under this point of view than the difference of
structure between vesuvius the peak of teneriffe and pichincha i
have chosen this last volcano in preference because its summit*
enters scarcely within the limit of the perpetual snows (* i have
measured the summit of pichincha that is the small mountain
covered with ashes above the llano del vulcan to the north of alto
de chuquira this mountain has not however the regular form of a
cone as to vesuvius i have indicated the mean height of the
sugar-loaf on account of the great difference between the two
edges of the crater) the cone of cotopaxi the form of which is
the most elegant and most regular known is 540 toises in height
but it is impossible to decide whether the whole of this mass is
covered with ashes

table 3 volcanoes

column 1 name of the volcano

column 2 total height in toises

  pichincha          2490  240  1/10

this table seems to indicate what we shall have an opportunity of
proving more amply hereafter that the peak of teneriffe belongs to
that group of great volcanoes which like etna and antisana have
had more copious eruptions from their sides than from their
summits thus the crater at the extremity of the piton which is
called the caldera is extremely small its diminutive size struck
m de borda and other travellers who took little interest in
geological investigations

as to the nature of the rocks which compose the soil of teneriffe
we must first distinguish between productions of the present
volcano and the range of basaltic mountains which surround the
peak and which do not rise more than five or six hundred toises
above the level of the ocean here as well as in italy mexico
and the cordilleras of quito the rocks of trap-formation* are at a
distance from the recent currents of lava (* the trap-formation
includes the basalts green-stone (grunstein) the trappean
porphyries the phonolites or porphyrschiefer etc) everything
shows that these two classes of substances though they owe their
origin to similar phenomena date from very different periods it
is important to geology not to confound the modern currents of
lava the heaps of basalt green-stone and phonolite dispersed
over the primitive and secondary formations with those porphyroid
masses having bases of compact feldspar* which perhaps have never
been perfectly liquified but which do not less belong to the
domain of volcanoes (* these petrosiliceous masses contain
vitreous and often calcined crystals of feldspar of amphibole of
pyroxene a little of olivine but scarcely any quartz to this
very ambiguous formation belong the trappean porphyries of
chimborazo and of riobamba in america of the euganean mountains in
italy and of the siebengebirge in germany as well as the domites
of the great-sarcouy of puy-de-dome of the little cleirsou and
of one part of the puy-chopine in auvergne)

in the island of teneriffe strata of tufa puzzolana and clay
separate the range of basaltic hills from the currents of recent
lithoid lava and from the eruptions of the present volcano in the
same manner as the eruptions of epomeo in the island of ischia and
those of jorullo in mexico have taken place in countries covered
with trappean porphyry ancient basalt and volcanic ashes so the
peak of teyde has raised itself amidst the wrecks of submarine
volcanoes notwithstanding the difference of composition in the
recent lavas of the peak there is a certain regularity of
position which must strike the naturalist least skilled in
geognosy the great elevated plain of retama separates the black
basaltic and earthlike lava from the vitreous and feldsparry
lava the basis of which is obsidian pitch-stone and phonolite
this phenomenon is the more remarkable inasmuch as in bohemia and
in other parts of europe the porphyrschiefer with base of
phonolite* (* klingstein werner) covers also the convex summits
of basaltic mountains

it has already been observed that from the level of the sea to
portillo and as far as the entrance on the elevated plain of the
retama that is two-thirds of the total height of the volcano the
ground is so covered with plants that it is difficult to make
geological observations the currents of lava which we discover on
the slope of monte verde between the beautiful spring of dornajito
and caravela are black masses altered by decomposition sometimes
porous and with very oblong pores the basis of these lower lavas
is rather wacke than basalt when it is spongy it resembles the
amygdaloids* of frankfort-on-the-main (* wakkenartiger
mandelstein steinkaute) its fracture is generally irregular
wherever it is conchoidal we may presume that the cooling has been
more rapid and the mass has been exposed to a less powerful
pressure these currents of lava are not divided into regular
prisms but into very thin layers not very regular in their
inclination they contain much olivine small grains of magnetic
iron and augite the colour of which often varies from deep
leek-green to olive green and which might be mistaken for
crystallized olivine though no transition from one to the other of
these substances exists* (* steffens handbuch der oryktognosie
tome 1 s 364 the crystals which mr friesleben and myself have
made known under the denomination of foliated olivine (blattriger
olivin) belong according to mr karsten to the pyroxene augite
journal des mines de freiberg 1791 page 215) amphibole is in
general very rare at teneriffe not only in the modern lithoid
lavas but also in the ancient basalts as has been observed by m
cordier who resided longer at the canaries than any other
mineralogist nepheline leucite idocrase and meionite have not
yet been seen at the peak of teneriffe for a reddish-grey lava
which we found on the slope of monte verde and which contains
small microscopic crystals appears to me to be a close mixture of
basalt and analcime* (* this substance which m dolomieu
discovered in the amygdaloids of catania in sicily and which
accompanies the stilbites of fassa in tyrol forms with the
chabasie of hauy the genus cubicit of werner m cordier found at
teneriffe xeolite in an amygdaloid which covers the basalts of la
punta di naga) in like manner the lava of scala with which the
city of naples is paved contains a close mixture of basalt
nepheline and leucite with respect to this last substance which
has hitherto been observed only at vesuvius and in the environs of
rome it exists perhaps at the peak of teneriffe in the old
currents of lava now covered by more recent ejections vesuvius
during a long series of years has also thrown out lavas without
leucites and if it be true as m von buch has rendered very
probable that these crystals are formed only in the currents which
flow either from the crater itself or very near its brink we must
not be surprised at not finding them in the lavas of the peak the
latter almost all proceed from lateral eruptions and consequently
have been exposed to an enormous pressure in the interior of the
volcano

in the plain of retama the basaltic lavas disappear under heaps of
ashes and pumice-stone reduced to powder thence to the summit
from 1500 to 1900 toises in height the volcano exhibits only
vitreous lava with bases of pitch-stone* (* petrosilex resinite
hauy) and obsidian these lavas destitute of amphibole and mica
are of a blackish brown often varying to the deepest olive green
they contain large crystals of feldspar which are not fissured
and seldom vitreous the analogy of those decidedly volcanic masses
with the resinite porphyries* (* pechstein-porphyr werner) of the
valley of tribisch in saxony is very remarkable but the latter
which belong to an extended and metalliferous formation of
porphyry often contain quartz which is wanting in the modern
lavas when the basis of the lavas of the malpays changes from
pitchstone to obsidian its colour is paler and is mixed with
grey in this case the feldspar passes by imperceptible gradations
from the common to the vitreous sometimes both varieties meet in
the same fragment as we observed also in the trappean porphyries
of the valley of mexico the feldsparry lavas of the peak of a
much less black tinge than those of arso in the island of ischia
whiten at the edge of the crater from the effect of the acid
vapours but internally they are not found to be colourless like
that of the feldsparry lavas of the solfatara at naples which
perfectly resemble the trappean porphyries at the foot of
chimborazo in the middle of the malpays at the height of the
cavern of ice we found among the vitreous lavas with pitch-stone
and obsidian bases blocks of real greenish-grey or mountain-green
phonolite with a smooth fracture and divided into thin laminae
sonorous and keen edged these masses were the same as the
porphyrschiefer of the mountain of bilin in bohemia we recognised
in them small long crystals of vitreous feldspar

this regular disposition of lithoid basaltic lava and feldsparry
vitreous lava is analogous to the phenomena of all trappean
mountains it reminds us of those phonolites lying in very ancient
basalts those close mixtures of augite and feldspar which cover
the hills of wacke or porous amygdaloids but why are the
porphyritic or feldsparry lavas of the peak found only on the
summit of the volcano? should we conclude from this position that
they are of more recent formation than the lithoid basaltic lava
which contains olivine and augite? i cannot admit this last
hypothesis for lateral eruptions may have covered the feldsparry
nucleus at a period when the crater had ceased its activity at
vesuvius also we perceive small crystals of vitreous feldspar only
in the very ancient lavas of the somma these lavas setting aside
the leucite very nearly resemble the phonolitic ejections of the
peak of teneriffe in general the farther we go back from the
period of modern eruptions the more the currents increase both in
size and extent acquiring the character of rocks by the
regularity of their position by their division into parallel
strata or by their independence of the present form of the ground

the peak of teneriffe is next to lipari the volcano that has
produced most obsidian this abundance is the more striking as in
other regions of the earth in iceland in hungary in mexico and
in the kingdom of quito we meet with obsidians only at great
distances from burning volcanoes sometimes they are scattered over
the fields in angular pieces for instance near popayan in south
america at other times they form isolated rocks as at quinche
near quito in other places (and this circumstance is very
remarkable) they are disseminated in pearl-stone as at
cinapecuaro in the province of mechoacan* (* to the west of the
city of mexico) and at the cabo de gates in spain at the peak of
teneriffe the obsidian is not found towards the base of the
volcano which is covered with modern lava it is frequent only
towards the summit especially from the plain of retama where very
fine specimens may be collected this peculiar position and the
circumstance that the obsidian of the peak has been ejected by a
crater which for ages past has thrown out no flames favour the
opinion that volcanic vitrifications wherever they are found are
to be considered as of very ancient formation

obsidian jade and lydian-stone* (* lydischerstein) are three
minerals which nations ignorant of the use of copper or iron have
in all ages employed for making keen-edged weapons we see that
wandering hordes have dragged with them in their distant journeys
stones the natural position of which the mineralogist has not yet
been able to determine hatchets of jade covered with aztec
hieroglyphics which i brought from mexico resemble both in their
form and nature those made use of by the gauls and those we find
among the south sea islanders the mexicans dug obsidian from
mines which were of vast extent and they employed it for making
knives sword-blades and razors in like manner the guanches (in
whose language obsidian was called tabona) fixed splinters of that
mineral to the ends of their lances they carried on a considerable
trade in it with the neighbouring islands and from the consumption
thus occasioned and the quantity of obsidian which must have been
broken in the course of manufacture we may presume that this
mineral has become scarce from the lapse of ages we are surprised
to see an atlantic nation substituting like the natives of
america vitrified lava for iron in both countries this variety of
lava was employed as an object of ornament and the inhabitants of
quito made beautiful looking-glasses with an obsidian divided into
parallel laminae

there are three varieties of obsidian at the peak some form
enormous blocks several toises long and often of a spheroidal
shape we might suppose that they had been thrown out in a softened
state and had afterwards been subject to a rotary motion they
contain a quantity of vitreous feldspar of a snow-white colour
and the most brilliant pearly lustre these obsidians are
nevertheless but little transparent on the edges they are almost
opaque of a brownish black and of an imperfect conchoidal
fracture they pass into pitch-stone and we may consider them as
porphyries with a basis of obsidian the second variety is found in
fragments much less considerable it is in general of a greenish
black sometimes of murky grey very seldom of a perfect black
like the obsidian of hecla and mexico its fracture is perfectly
conchoidal and it is extremely transparent on the edges i have
found in it neither amphibole nor pyroxene but some small white
points which seem to be feldspar none of the obsidians of the
peak appear in those grey masses of pearl or lavender-blue
striped and in separate wedge-formed pieces like the obsidian of
quito mexico and lipari and which resemble the fibrous plates of
the crystalites of our glass-houses on which sir james hall dr
thompson and m de bellevue have published some curious
observations* (* the name crystalites has been given to the
crystalized thin plates observed in glass cooling slowly the term
glastenized glass is employed by dr thompson and others to
indicate glass which by slow cooling is wholly unvitrified and has
assumed the appearance of a fossil substance or real glass-stone)

the third variety of obsidian of the peak is the most remarkable of
the whole from its connexion with pumice-stone it is like that
above described of a greenish black sometimes of a murky grey
but its very thin plates alternate with layers of pumice-stone dr
thomson's fine collection at naples contained similar examples of
lithoid lava of vesuvius divided into very distinct plates only a
line thick the fibres of the pumice-stone of the peak are very
seldom parallel to each other and perpendicular to the strata of
obsidian they are most commonly irregular asbestoidal like
fibrous glass-gall and instead of being disseminated in the
obsidian like crystalites they are found simply adhering to one
of the external surfaces of this substance during my stay at
madrid m hergen showed me several specimens in the mineralogical
collection of don jose clavijo and for a long time the spanish
mineralogists considered them as furnishing undoubted proofs that
pumice-stone owes its origin to obsidian in some degree deprived
of colour and swelled by volcanic fire i was formerly of this
opinion which however must be understood to refer to one variety
only of pumice i even thought with many other geologists that
obsidian so far from being vitrified lava belonged to rocks that
were not volcanic and that the fire forcing its way through the
basalts the green-stone rocks the phonolites and the porphyries
with bases of pitchstone and obsidian the lavas and pumice-stone
were no other than these same rocks altered by the action of the
volcanoes the deprivation of colour and extraordinary swelling
which the greater part of the obsidians undergo in a forge-fire
their transition into pitch-stone and their position in regions
very distant from burning volcanoes appear to be phenomena very
difficult to reconcile when we consider the obsidians as volcanic
glass a more profound study of nature new journeys and
observations made on the productions of burning volcanoes have led
me to renounce those ideas

it appears to me at present extremely probable that obsidians and
porphyries with bases of obsidian are vitrified masses the
cooling of which has been too rapid to change them into lithoid
lava i consider even the pearlstone as an unvitrified obsidian
for among the minerals in the king's cabinet at berlin there are
volcanic glasses from lipari in which we see striated crystalites
of a pearl-grey colour and of an earthy appearance forming
gradual approaches to a granular lithoid lava like the pearlstone
of cinapecuaro in mexico the oblong bubbles observed in the
obsidians of every continent are incontestible proofs of their
ancient state of igneous fluidity and dr thompson possesses
specimens from lipari which are very instructive in this point of
view because fragments of red porphyry or porphyry lavas which
do not entirely fill up the cavities of the obsidian are found
enveloped in them we might say that these fragments had not time
to enter into complete solution in the liquified mass they contain
vitreous feldspar and augite and are the same as the celebrated
columnar porphyries of the island of panaria which without having
been part of a current of lava seem raised up in the form of
hillocks like many of the porphyries in auvergne in the euganean
mountains and in the cordilleras of the andes

the objections against the volcanic origin of obsidians founded on
their speedy loss of colour and their swelling by a slow fire
have been shaken by the ingenious experiments of sir james hall
these experiments prove that a stone which is fusible only at
thirty-eight degrees of wedgwood's pyrometer yields a glass that
softens at fourteen degrees and that this glass melted again and
unvitrified (glastenized) is fusible again only at thirty-five
degrees of the same pyrometer i applied the blowpipe to some black
pumice-stone from the volcano of the isle of bourbon which on the
slightest contact with the flame whitened and melted into an
enamel

but whether obsidians be primitive rocks which have undergone the
action of volcanic fire or lavas repeatedly melted within the
crater the origin of the pumice-stones contained in the obsidian
of the peak of teneriffe is not less problematic this subject is
the more worthy of being investigated since it is generally
interesting to the geology of volcanoes and since that excellent
mineralogist m fleuriau de bellevue after having examined italy
and the adjacent islands with great attention affirms that it is
highly improbable that pumice-stone owes its origin to the swelling
of obsidian

the experiments of m da camara and those i made in 1802 tend to
support the opinion that the pumice-stones adherent to the
obsidians of the peak of teneriffe do not unite to them
accidentally but are produced by the expansion of an elastic
fluid which is disengaged from the compact vitreous matter this
idea had for a long time occupied the mind of a person highly
distinguished for his talents and reputation at quito who
unacquainted with the labours of the mineralogists of europe had
devoted himself to researches on the volcanoes of his country don
juan de larea one of those men lately sacrificed to the fury of
faction had been struck with the phenomena exhibited by obsidians
exposed to a white heat he had thought that wherever volcanoes
act in the centre of a country covered with porphyry with base of
obsidian the elastic fluids must cause a swelling of the liquified
mass and perform an important part in the earthquakes preceding
eruptions without adopting an opinion which seems somewhat bold
i made in concert with m larea a series of experiments on the
tumefaction of the volcanic vitreous substances at teneriffe and
on those which are found at quinche in the kingdom of quito to
judge of the augmentation of their bulk we measured pieces exposed
to a forge-fire of moderate heat by the water they displaced from
a cylindric glass enveloping the spongy mass with a thin coating
of wax according to our experiments the obsidians swelled very
unequally those of the peak and the black varieties of cotopaxi
and of quinche increased nearly five times their bulk

the colour of the pumice-stones of the peak leads to another
important observation the sea of white ashes which encircles the
piton and covers the vast plain of retama is a certain proof of
the former activity of the crater for in all volcanoes even when
there are lateral eruptions the ashes and the rapilli issue
conjointly with the vapours only from the opening at the summit of
the mountain now at teneriffe the black rapilli extend from the
foot of the peak to the sea-shore while the white ashes which are
only pumice ground to powder and among which i have discovered
with a lens fragments of vitreous feldspar and pyroxene
exclusively occupy the region next to the peak this peculiar
distribution seems to confirm the observations made long ago at
vesuvius that the white ashes are thrown out last and indicate
the end of the eruption in proportion as the elasticity of the
vapours diminishes the matter is thrown to a less distance and
the black rapilli which issue first when the lava has ceased
running must necessarily reach farther than the white rapilli the
latter appear to have been exposed to the action of a more intense
fire

i have now examined the exterior structure of the peak and the
composition of its volcanic productions from the region of the
coast to the top of the piton i have endeavoured to render these
researches interesting by comparing the phenomena of the volcano
of teneriffe with those that are observed in other regions the
soil of which is equally undermined by subterranean fires this
mode of viewing nature in the universality of her relations is no
doubt adverse to the rapidity desirable in an itinerary but it
appears to me that in a narrative the principal end of which is
the progress of physical knowledge every other consideration ought
to be subservient to those of instruction and utility by isolating
facts travellers whose labours are in every other respect
valuable have given currency to many false ideas of the pretended
contrasts which nature offers in africa in new holland and on the
ridge of the cordilleras the great geological phenomena are
subject to regular laws as well as the forms of plants and
animals the ties which unite these phenomena the relations which
exist between the varied forms of organized beings are discovered
only when we have acquired the habit of viewing the globe as a
great whole and when we consider in the same point of view the
composition of rocks the causes which alter them and the
productions of the soil in the most distant regions

having treated of the volcanic substances of the isle of teneriffe
there now remains to be solved a question intimately connected with
the preceding investigation does the archipelago of the canary
islands contain any rocks of primitive or secondary formation or
is there any production observed that has not been modified by
fire? this interesting problem has been considered by the
naturalists of lord macartney's expedition and by those who
accompanied captain baudin in his voyage to the austral regions
their opinions are in direct opposition to each other and the
contradiction is the more striking as the question does not refer
to one of those geological reveries which we are accustomed to call
systems but to a positive fact

doctor gillan imagined that he observed between laguna and the
port of orotava in very deep ravines beds of primitive rocks
this however is a mistake what dr gillan calls somewhat
vaguely mountains of hard ferruginous clay are nothing but an
alluvium which we find at the foot of every volcano strata of clay
accompany basalts as tufas accompany modern lavas neither m
cordier nor myself observed in any part of teneriffe a primitive
rock either in its natural place or thrown out by the mouth of
the peak and the absence of these rocks characterizes almost every
island of small extent that has an unextinguishied volcano we know
nothing positive of the mountains of the azores but it is certain
that the island of bourbon as well as teneriffe exhibits only a
heap of lavas and basalts no volcanic rock rears its head either
on the gros morne or on the volcano of bourbon or on the colossal
pyramid of cimandef which is perhaps more elevated than the peak
of the canary islands

bory st vincent nevertheless asserted that lavas including
fragments of granite have been found on the elevated plain of
retama and m broussonnet informed me that on a hill above
guimar fragments of mica-slate containing beautiful plates of
specular iron had been found i can affirm nothing respecting the
accuracy of this latter statement which it would be so much the
more important to verify as m poli of naples is in possession
of a fragment of rock thrown out by vesuvius* which i found to be
a real mica-slate (* in the valuable collection of dr thomson
who resided at naples till 1805 is a fragment of lava enclosing a
real granite which is composed of reddish feldspar with a pearly
lustre like adularia quartz mica hornblende and what is very
remarkable lazulite but in general the masses of known primitive
rocks (i mean those which perfectly resemble our granites our
gneiss and our mica-slates) are very rare in lavas the substances
we commonly denote by the name of granite thrown out by vesuvius
are mixtures of nepheline mica and pyroxene we are ignorant
whether these mixtures constitute rocks sui generis placed under
granite and consequently of more ancient date or simply form
either intermediate strata on veins in the interior of the
primitive mountains the tops of which appear at the surface of the
globe) every thing that tends to enlighten us with respect to the
site of the volcanic fire and the position of rocks subject to its
action is highly interesting to geology

it is possible that at the peak of teneriffe the fragments of
primitive rocks thrown out by the mouth of the volcano may be less
rare than they at present appear to be and may be heaped together
in some ravine not yet visited by travellers in fact at
vesuvius these same fragments are met with only in one single
place at the fossa grande where they are hidden under a thick
layer of ashes if this ravine had not long ago attracted the
attention of naturalists when masses of granular limestone and
other primitive rocks were laid bare by the rains we might have
thought them as rare at vesuvius as they are at least in
appearance at the peak of teneriffe

with respect to the fragments of granite gneiss and mica-slate
found on the shores of santa cruz and orotava they were probably
brought in ships as ballast they no more belong to the soil where
they lie than the feldsparry lavas of etna seen in the pavements
of hamburg and other towns of the north the naturalist is exposed
to a thousand errors if he lose sight of the changes produced on
the surface of the globe by the intercourse between nations we
might be led to say that man when expatriating himself is
desirous that everything should change country with him not only
plants insects and different species of small quadrupeds follow
him across the ocean his active industry covers the shores with
rocks which he has torn from the soil in distant climes

though it be certain that no scientific observer has hitherto
found at teneriffe primitive strata or even those trappean and
ambiguous porphyries which constitute the bases of etna and of
several volcanoes of the andes we must not conclude from this
isolated fact that the whole archipelago of the canaries is the
production of submarine fires the island of gomera contains
mountains of granite and mica-slate and it is undoubtedly in
these very ancient rocks that we must seek there as well as on
all other parts of the globe the centre of the volcanic action
amphibole sometimes pure and forming intermediate strata at other
times mixed with granite as in the basanites or basalts of the
ancients may of itself furnish all the iron contained in the
black and stony lavas this quantity amounts in the basalt of the
modern mineralogists only to 020 while in amphibole it exceeds 0
30

from several well-informed persons to whom i addressed myself i
learned that there are calcareous formations in the great canary
forteventura and lancerota* (* at lancerota calcareous stone is
burned to lime with a fire made of the alhulaga a new species of
thorny and arborescent sonchus) i was not able to determine the
nature of this secondary rock but it appears certain that the
island of teneriffe is altogether destitute of it and that in its
alluvial lands it exhibits only clayey calcareous tufa alternating
with volcanic breccia said to contain (near the village of la
rambla at calderas and near candelaria) plants imprints of
fishes buccinites and other fossil marine productions m cordier
brought away some of this tufa which resembles that in the
environs of naples and rome and contains fragments of reeds at
the salvages which islands la perouse took at a distance for
masses of scoriae even fibrous gypsum is found

i had seen while herborizing between the port of orotava and the
garden of la paz heaps of greyish calcareous stones of an
imperfect conchoidal fracture and analogous to that of mount jura
and the apennines i was informed that these stones were extracted
from a quarry near rambla and that there were similar quarries
near realejo and the mountain of roxas above adexa this
information led me into an error as the coasts of portugal consist
of basalts covering calcareous rocks containing shells i imagined
that a trappean formation like that of the vicentin in lombardy
and of harutsh in africa might have extended from the banks of the
tagus and cape st vincent as far as the canary islands and that
the basalts of the peak might perhaps conceal a secondary
calcareous stone these conjectures exposed me to severe
animadversions from m ga de luc who is of opinion that every
volcanic island is only an accumulation of lavas and scoriae m de
luc declares it is impossible that real lava should contain
fragments of vegetable substances our collections however
contain pieces of trunks of palm-trees enclosed and penetrated by
the very liquid lava of the isle of bourbon

though teneriffe belongs to a group of islands of considerable
extent the peak exhibits nevertheless all the characteristics of a
mountain rising on a solitary islet the lead finds no bottom at a
little distance from the ports of santa cruz orotava and
garachico in this respect it is like st helena the ocean as
well as the continents has its mountains and its plains and if
we except the andes volcanic cones are formed everywhere in the
lower regions of the globe

as the peak rises amid a system of basalts and old lava and as the
whole part which is visible above the surface of the waters
exhibits burnt substances it has been supposed that this immense
pyramid is the effect of a progressive accumulation of lavas or
that it contains in its centre a nucleus of primitive rocks both
of these suppositions appear to me ill-founded i think there is as
little probability that mountains of granite gneiss or primitive
calcareous stone have existed where we now see the tops of the
peak of vesuvius and of etna as in the plains where almost in
our own time has been formed the volcano of jorullo which is more
than a third of the height of vesuvius on examining the
circumstances which accompanied the formation of the new island
called sabrina in the archipelago of the azores* (* at sabrina
island near st michael's the crater opened at the foot of a
solid rock of almost a cubical form this rock surmounted by a
small elevated plain perfectly level is more than two hundred
toises in breadth its formation was anterior to that of the
crater into which a few days after its opening the sea made an
irruption at kameni the smoke was not even visible till
twenty-six days after the appearance of the upheaved rocks
philosophical transactions volume 26 pages 69 and 200 volume 27
page 353 all these phenomena on which mr hawkins collected very
valuable observations during his abode at santorino are
unfavourable to the idea commonly entertained of the origin of
volcanic mountains they are usually ascribed to a progressive
accumulation of liquified matter and the diffusion of lavas
issuing from a central mouth) on carefully reading the minute and
simple narrative given by the jesuit bourguignon of the slow
appearance of the islet of the little kameni near santorino we
find that these extraordinary eruptions are generally preceded by a
swelling of the softened crust of the globe rocks appear above the
waters before the flames force their way or lavas issue from the
crater we must distinguish between the nucleus raised up and the
mass of lavas and scoriae which successively increases its
dimensions

it is true that from all existing records of revolutions of this
kind the perpendicular height of the stony nucleus appears never
to have exceeded one hundred and fifty or two hundred toises even
taking into the account the depth of the sea the bottom of which
had been lifted up but when considering the great effects of
nature and the intensity of its forces the bulk of the masses
must not deter the geologist in his speculations every thing
indicates that the physical changes of which tradition has
preserved the remembrance exhibit but a feeble image of those
gigantic catastrophes which have given mountains their present
form changed the positions of the rocky strata and buried
sea-shells on the summits of the higher alps doubtless in those
remote times which preceded the existence of the human race the
raised crust of the globe produced those domes of trappean
porphyry those hills of isolated basalt on vast elevated plains
those solid nuclei which are clothed in the modern lavas of the
peak of etna and of cotopaxi the volcanic revolutions have
succeeded each other after long intervals and at very different
periods of this we see the vestiges in the transition mountains
in the secondary strata and in those of alluvium volcanoes of
earlier date than the sandstone and calcareous rocks have been for
ages extinguished those which are yet in activity are in general
surrounded only with breccias and modern tufas but nothing hinders
us from admitting that the archipelago of the canaries may exhibit
some real rocks of secondary formation if we recollect that
subterranean fires have been there rekindled in the midst of a
system of basalts and very ancient lavas

we seek in vain in the periplus of hanno or of scylax for the first
written notions on the eruptions of the peak of teneriffe those
navigators sailed timidly along the coast anchoring every evening
in some bay and had no knowledge of a volcano distant fifty-six
leagues from the coast of africa hanno nevertheless relates that
he saw torrents of light which seemed to fall on the sea that
every night the coast was covered with fire and that the great
mountain called the car of the gods appeared to throw up sheets
of flame which rose even to the clouds but this mountain
situated northward of the island of the gorilli formed the western
extremity of the atlas chain and it is also very uncertain whether
the flames seen by hanno were the effect of some volcanic eruption
or whether they must be attributed to the custom common to many
nations of setting fire to the forests and dry grass of the
savannahs in our own days similar doubts were entertained by the
naturalists who in the voyage of d'entrecasteaux saw the island
of amsterdam covered with a thick smoke on the coast of the
caracas trains of reddish fire fed by the burning grass appeared
to me for several nights under the delusive semblance of a
current of lava descending from the mountains and dividing itself
into several branches

though the narratives of hanno and scylax in the state in which
they have reached us contain no passage which we can reasonably
apply to the canary islands it is very probable that the
carthaginians and even the phoenicians had some knowledge of the
peak of teneriffe in the time of plato and aristotle vague
notions of it had reached the greeks who considered the whole of
the coast of africa beyond the pillars of hercules as thrown into
disorder by the fire of volcanoes the abode of the blessed which
was sought first in the north beyond the riphaean mountains among
the hyperboreans and next to the south of cyrenaica was supposed
to be situated in regions that were considered to be westward
being the direction in which the world known to the ancients
terminated the name of fortunate islands was long in as vague
signification as that of el dorado among the conquerors of
america happiness was thought to reside at the end of the earth
as we seek for the most exquisite enjoyments of the mind in an
ideal world beyond the limits of reality* (* the idea of the
happiness the great civilization and the riches of the
inhabitants of the north was common to the greeks to the people
of india and to the mexicans)

we must not be surprised that previous to the time of aristotle
we find no accurate notion respecting the canary islands and the
volcanoes they contain among the greek geographers the only
nation whose navigations extended toward the west and the north
the carthaginians were interested in throwing a veil of mystery
over those distant regions while the senate of carthage was averse
to any partial emigration it pointed out those islands as a place
of refuge in times of trouble and public misfortune they were to
the carthaginians what the free soil of america has become to
europeans amidst their religious and civil dissensions

the canaries were not better known to the romans till eighty-four
years before the reign of augustus a private individual was
desirous of executing the project which wise foresight had
dictated to the senate of carthage sertorius conquered by sylla
and weary of the din of war looked out for a safe and peaceable
retreat he chose the fortunate islands of which a delightful
picture had been drawn for him on the shores of baetica he
carefully combined the notions he acquired from travellers but in
the little that has been transmitted to us of those notions and in
the more minute descriptions of sebosus and juba there is no
mention of volcanoes or volcanic eruptions scarcely can we
recognise the isle of teneriffe and the snows with which the
summit of the peak is covered in winter in the name of nivaria
given to one of the fortunate islands hence we might conclude
that the volcano at that time threw out no flames if it were
allowable so to interpret the silence of a few authors whom we
know only by short fragments or dry nomenclatures the naturalist
vainly seeks in history for documents of the first eruptions of the
peak he nowhere finds any but in the language of the guanches in
which the word echeyde denotes at the same time hell and the
volcano of teneriffe

of all the written testimonies the oldest i have found in relation
to the activity of this volcano dates from the beginning of the
sixteenth century it is contained in the narrative of the voyage
of aloysio cadamusto who landed at the canaries in 1505 this
traveller was witness of no eruptions but he positively affirms
that like etna this mountain burns without interruption and that
the fire has been seen by christians held in slavery by the
guanches of teneriffe the peak therefore was not at that time in
the state of repose in which we find it at present for it is
certain that no navigator or inhabitant of teneriffe has seen issue
from the mouth of the peak i will not say flames but even any
smoke visible at a distance it would be well perhaps were the
funnel of the caldera to open anew the lateral eruptions would
thereby be rendered less violent and the whole group of islands
would be less endangered by earthquakes

the eruptions of the peak have been very rare for two centuries
past and these long intervals appear to characterize volcanoes
highly elevated the smallest one of all stromboli is almost
always burning at vesuvius the eruptions are rarer than formerly
though still more frequent than those of etna and the peak of
teneriffe the colossal summits of the andes cotopaxi and
tungurahua scarcely have an eruption once in a century we may
say that in active volcanoes the frequency of the eruptions is in
the inverse ratio of the height and the mass the peak also had
seemed extinguished during ninety-two years when in 1798 it made
its last eruption by a lateral opening formed in the mountain of
chahorra in this interval vesuvius had sixteen eruptions

the whole of the mountainous part of the kingdom of quito may be
considered as an immense volcano occupying more than seven hundred
square leagues of surface and throwing out flames by different
cones known under the particular denominations of cotopaxi
tungurahua and pichincha the group of the canary islands is
situated on the same sort of submarine volcano the fire makes its
way sometimes by one and sometimes by another of these islands
teneriffe alone contains in its centre an immense pyramid
terminating in a crater and throwing out from one century to
another lava by its flanks in the other islands the different
eruptions have taken place in various parts and we nowhere find
those isolated mountains to which the volcanic effects are
confined the basaltic crust formed by ancient volcanoes seems
everywhere undermined and the currents of lava seen at lancerota
and palma remind us by every geological affinity of the eruption
which took place in 1301 at the island of ischia amid the tufas of
epomeo

the exclusively lateral action of the peak of teneriffe is a
geological phenomenon the more remarkable as it contributes to
make the mountains which are backed by the principal volcano appear
isolated it is true that in etna and vesuvius the great flowings
of lava do not proceed from the crater itself and that the
abundance of melted matter is generally in the inverse ratio of the
height of the opening whence the lava is ejected but at vesuvius
and etna a lateral eruption constantly terminates by flashes of
flame and by ashes issuing from the crater that is from the
summit of the mountain at the peak this phenomenon has not been
witnessed for ages and yet recently in the eruption of 1798 the
crater remained quite inactive its bottom did not sink in while
at vesuvius as m von buch has observed the greater or less depth
of the crater is an infallible indication of the proximity of a new
eruption

i might terminate these geological sketches by enquiring into the
nature of the combustible which has fed for so many thousands of
years the fire of the peak of teneriffe i might examine whether
it be sodium or potassium the metallic basis of some earth
carburet of hydrogen or pure sulphur combined with iron that
burns in the volcano but wishing to limit myself to what may be
the object of direct observation i shall not take upon me to solve
a problem for which we have not yet sufficient data we know not
whether we may conclude from the enormous quantity of sulphur
contained in the crater of the peak that it is this substance
which keeps up the heat of the volcano or whether the fire fed by
some combustible of an unknown nature effects merely the
sublimation of the sulphur what we learn from observation is that
in craters which are still burning sulphur is very rare while all
the ancient volcanoes end in becoming sulphur-pits we might
presume that in the former the sulphur is combined with oxygen
while in the latter it is merely sublimated for nothing hitherto
authorises us to admit that it is formed in the interior of
volcanoes like ammonia and the neutral salts when we were yet
unacquainted with sulphur except as disseminated in the
muriatiferous gypsum and in the alpine limestone we were almost
forced to the belief that in every part of the globe the volcanic
fire acted on rocks of secondary formation but recent observations
have proved that sulphur exists in great abundance in those
primitive rocks which so many phenomena indicate as the centre of
the volcanic action near alausi at the back of the andes of
quito i found an immense quantity in a bed of quartz which formed
a layer of mica-slate this fact is the more important as it is in
strict conformity with the conclusions deduced from the observation
of those fragments of ancient rocks which are thrown out intact by
volcanoes

we have just considered the island of teneriffe merely in a
geological point of view we have seen the peak towering amid
fractured strata of basalt and mandelstein let us examine how
these fused masses have been gradually adorned with vegetable
clothing what is the distribution of plants on the steep declivity
of the volcano and what is the aspect or physiognomy of vegetation
in the canary islands

in the northern part of the temperate zone the cryptogamous plants
are the first that cover the stony crust of the globe the lichens
and mosses that develop their foliage beneath the snows are
succeeded by grumina and other phanerogamous plants this order of
vegetation differs on the borders of the torrid zone and in the
countries between the tropics we there find it is true whatever
some travellers may have asserted not only on the mountains but
also in humid and shady places almost on a level with the sea
funaria dicranum and bryum and these genera among their
numerous species exhibit several which are common to lapland to
the peak of teneriffe and to the blue mountains of jamaica (this
extraordinary fact was first observed by m swarz it was confirmed
by m willdenouw when he carefully examined our herbals especially
the collection of cryptogamous plants which we gathered on the
tops of the andes in a region of the world where organic life is
totally different from that of the old world) nevertheless in
general it is not by mosses and lichens that vegetation in the
countries near the tropics begins in the canary islands as well
as in guinea and on the rocky coasts of peru the first vegetation
which prepares the soil are the succulent plants the leaves of
which provided with an infinite number of orifices* (* the pores
corticaux of m decandolle discovered by gleichen and figured by
hedwig) and cutaneous vessels deprive the ambient air of the
water it holds in solution fixed in the crevices of volcanic
rocks they form as it were that first layer of vegetable earth
with which the currents of lithoid lava are clothed wherever these
lavas are scorified and where they have a shining surface as in
the basaltic mounds to the north of lancerota the development of
vegetation is extremely slow and many ages may pass away before
shrubs can take root it is only when lavas are covered with tufa
and ashes that the volcanic islands losing that appearance of
nudity which marks their origin bedeck themselves in rich and
brilliant vegetation

in its present state the island of teneriffe the chinerfe* (* of
chinerfe the europeans have formed by corruption tchineriffe and
teneriffe) of the guanches exhibits five zones of plants which
we may distinguish by the names region of vines region of
laurels region of pines region of the retama and region of
grasses these zones are ranged in stages one above another and
occupy on the steep declivity of the peak a perpendicular height
of 1750 toises while fifteen degrees farther north on the
pyrenees snow descends to thirteen or fourteen hundred toises of
absolute elevation if the plants of teneriffe do not reach the
summit of the volcano it is not because the perpetual snow and the
cold of the surrounding atmosphere mark limits which they cannot
pass it is the scorified lava of the malpays the powdered and
barren pumice-stone of the piton which impede the migration of
plants towards the brink of the crater

the first zone that of the vines extends from the sea-shore to
two or three hundred toises of height it is that which is most
inhabited and the only part carefully cultivated in the low
regions at the port of orotava and wherever the winds have free
access the centigrade thermometer stands in winter in the months
of january and february at noon between fifteen and seventeen
degrees and the greatest heats of summer do not exceed twenty-five
or twenty-six degrees the mean temperature of the coasts of
teneriffe appears at least to rise to twenty-one degrees (168
degrees reaumur) and the climate in those parts keeps at the
medium between the climate of naples and that of the torrid zone

the region of the vines exhibits among its vegetable productions
eight kinds of arborescent euphorbia mesembrianthema which are
multiplied from the cape of good hope to the peloponnesus the
cacalia kleinia the dracaena and other plants which in their
naked and tortuous trunks in their succulent leaves and their
tint of bluish green exhibit distinctive marks of the vegetation
of africa it is in this zone that the date-tree the plantain the
sugar-cane the indian fig the arum colocasia the root of which
furnishes a nutritive fecula the olive-tree the fruit trees of
europe the vine and corn are cultivated corn is reaped from the
end of march to the beginning of may and the culture of the
bread-fruit tree of otaheite that of the cinnamon tree of the
moluccas the coffee-tree of arabia and the cacao-tree of america
have been tried with success on several points of the coast the
country assumes the character of a tropical landscape and we
perceive that the region of the palms extends beyond the limits of
the torrid zone the chamaerops and the date-tree flourish in the
fertile plains of murviedro on the coasts of genoa and in
provence near antibes between the thirty-ninth and forty-fourth
degrees of latitude a few trees of the latter species planted
within the walls of the city of rome resist even the cold of 25
degrees below freezing point but if the south of europe as yet
only partially shares the gifts lavished by nature on the zone of
palms the island of teneriffe situated on the parallel of egypt
southern persia and florida is adorned with the greater part of
the vegetable forms which add to the majesty of the landscape in
the regions near the equator

on reviewing the different tribes of indigenous plants we regret
not finding trees with small pinnated leaves and arborescent
gramina no species of the numerous family of the sensitive-plants
has migrated as far as the archipelago of the canary islands while
on both continents they have been seen in the thirty-eighth and
fortieth degrees of latitude on a more careful examination of the
plants of the islands of lancerota and forteventura which are
nearest the coast of morocco we may perhaps find a few mimosas
among many other plants of the african flora

the second zone that of the laurels comprises the woody part of
teneriffe this is the region of the springs which gush forth
amidst turf always verdant and never parched with drought lofty
forests crown the hills leading to the volcano and in them are
found four species of laurel* (* laurus indica l foetens l
nobilis and l til with these trees are mingled the ardisia
excelsa rhamnus glandulosus erica arborea and e texo) an oak
nearly resembling the quercus turneri* (* quercus canariensis
broussonnet) of the mountains of tibet the visnea mocanera the
myrica faya of the azores a native olive (olea excelsa) which is
the largest tree of this zone two species of sideroxylon the
leaves of which are extremely beautiful the arbutus callicarpa
and other evergreen trees of the family of myrtles bindweeds and
an ivy very different from that of europe (hedera canariensis)
entwine the trunks of the laurels at their feet vegetate a
numberless quantity of ferns* (* woodwardia radicans asplenium
palmatum a canariensis a latifolium nothalaena subcordata
trichomanes canariensis t speciosum and davallia canariensis)
of which three species* (* two acrostichums and the ophyoglossum
lusitanicum) alone descend as low as the region of the vines the
soil covered with mosses and tender grass is enriched with the
flowers of the campanula aurea the chrysanthemum pinnatifidum the
mentha canariensis and several bushy species of hypericum* (*
hypericum canariense h floribundum and h glandulosum)
plantations of wild and grafted chestnut-trees form a broad border
round the region of the springs which is the greenest and most
agreeable of the whole

in the third zone (beginning at nine hundred toises of absolute
height) the last groups of arbutus of myrica faya and of that
beautiful heath known to the natives by the name of texo appear
this zone four hundred toises in breadth is entirely filled by a
vast forest of pines among which mingles the juniperus cedro of
broussonnet the leaves of these pines are very long and stiff and
they sprout sometimes by pairs but oftener by threes in one
sheath having had no opportunity of examining the fructification
we cannot say whether this species which has the appearance of the
scotch fir is really different from the eighteen species of pines
with which we are already acquainted in europe m decandolle is of
opinion that the pine of teneriffe is equally distinct from the
pinus atlantica of the neighbouring mountains of mogador and from
the pine of aleppo* (* pinus halepensis m decandolle observes
that this species which is not found in portugal but grows on the
mediterranean shores of france spain and italy in asia minor
and in barbary would be better named pinus mediterranea it
composes the principal part of the pine-forests of the south-east
of france where gouan and gerard have confounded it with the pinus
sylvestris it comprehends the pinus halepensis mill lamb and
desfont and the pinus maritima lamb) which belongs to the basin
of the mediterranean and does not appear to have passed the
pillars of hercules we met with these last pines on the slope of
the peak near twelve hundred toises above the level of the sea in
the cordilleras of new spain under the torrid zone the mexican
pines extend to the height of two thousand toises notwithstanding
the similarity of structure existing between the different species
of the same genus of plants each of them requires a certain degree
of temperature and rarity in the ambient air to attain its due
growth if in temperate climates and wherever snow falls the
uniform heat of the soil be somewhat above the mean heat of the
atmosphere it is probable that at the height of portillo the roots
of the pines draw their nourishment from a soil in which at a
certain depth the thermometer rises at most to nine or ten
degrees

the fourth and fifth zones the regions of the retama and the
gramina occupy heights equal to the most inaccessible summits of
the pyrenees it is the sterile part of the island where heaps of
pumice-stone obsidian and broken lava form impediments to
vegetation we have already spoken of those flowery tufts of alpine
broom (spartium nubigenum) which form oases amidst a vast desert
of ashes two herbaceous plants the scrophularia glabrata and the
viola cheiranthifolia advance even to the malpays above a turf
scorched by the heat of an african sun an arid soil is overspread
by the cladonia paschalis towards the summit of the peak the
urceolarea and other plants of the family of the lichens help to
work the decomposition of the scorified matter by this unceasing
action of organic force the empire of flora is extended over
islands ravaged by volcanoes

on surveying the different zones of the vegetation of teneriffe we
perceive that the whole island may be considered as a forest of
laurels arbutus and pines containing in its centre a naked and
rocky soil unfit either for pasturage or cultivation m
broussonnet observes that the archipelago of the canaries may be
divided into two groups of islands the first comprising lancerota
and forteventura the second teneriffe canary gomera ferro and
palma the appearance of the vegetation essentially differs in
these two groups the eastern islands lancerota and forteventura
consist of extensive plains and mountains of little elevation they
have very few springs and bear the appearance still more than the
other islands of having been separated from the continent the
winds blow in the same direction and at the same periods the
euphorbia mauritanica the atropa frutescens and the arborescent
sonchus vegetate there in the loose sands and afford as in
africa food for camels the western group of the canaries presents
a more elevated soil is more woody and is watered by a greater
number of springs

though the whole archipelago contains several plants found also in
portugal* (* m willdenouw and myself found among the plants of
the peak of teneriffe the beautiful satyrium diphyllum (orchis
cordata willd) which mr link discovered in portugal the
canaries have in common with the flora of the azores not the
dicksonia culcita the only arborescent heath found at the
thirty-ninth degree of latitude but the asplenium palmatum and
the myrica faya this last tree is met with in portugal in a wild
state count hoffmansegg has seen very old trunks of it but it was
doubtful whether it was indigenous or imported into that part of
our continent in reflecting on the migrations of plants and on
the geological possibility that lands sunk in the ocean may have
heretofore united portugal the azores the canaries and the chain
of atlas we conceive that the existence of the myrica faya in
western europe is a phenomenon at least as striking as that of the
pine of aleppo would be at the azores) in spain at the azores
and in the north-west of africa yet a great number of species and
even some genera are peculiar to teneriffe to porto santo and to
madeira such are the mocanera the plocama the bosea the
canarina the drusa and the pittosporum a form which may be
called northern that of the cruciform plant (among the small
number of cruciform species contained in the flora of teneriffe we
shall here mention cheiranthus longifolius l'herit ch
fructescens vent ch scoparius brouss erysimum bicorne
aiton crambe strigosa and c laevigata brouss) is much rarer
in the canaries than in spain and in greece still farther to the
south in the equinoctial regions of both continents where the
mean temperature of the air rises above twenty-two degrees the
cruciform plants are scarcely ever to be seen

a question highly interesting to the history of the progressive
marks of organization on the globe has been very warmly discussed
in our own times that of ascertaining whether the polymorphous
plants are more common in the volcanic islands the vegetation of
teneriffe is unfavourable to the hypothesis that nature in new
countries is but little subject to permanent forms m broussonnet
who resided so long at the canaries asserts that the variable
plants are not more common there than in the south of europe may
it not to be presumed that the polymorphous species which are so
abundant in the isle of bourbon are assignable to the nature of
the soil and climate rather than to the newness of the vegetation?

before we take leave of the old world to pass into the new i must
advert to a subject which is of general interest because it
belongs to the history of man and to those fatal revolutions which
have swept off whole tribes from the face of the earth we inquire
at the isle of cuba at st domingo and in jamaica where is the
abode of the primitive inhabitants of those countries? we ask at
teneriffe what is become of the guanches whose mummies alone
buried in caverns have escaped destruction? in the fifteenth
century almost all mercantile nations especially the spaniards and
the portuguese sought for slaves at the canary islands as in
later times they have been sought on the coast of guinea* (* the
spanish historians speak of expeditions made by the huguenots of
rochelle to carry off guanche slaves i have some doubt respecting
these expeditions which are said to have taken place subsequently
to the year 1530) the christian religion which in its origin was
so highly favourable to the liberty of mankind served afterwards
as a pretext to the cupidity of europeans every individual made
prisoner before he received the rite of baptism became a slave at
that period no attempt had yet been made to prove that the blacks
were an intermediate race between man and animals the swarthy
guanche and the african negro were simultaneously sold in the
market of seville without a question whether slavery should be the
doom only of men with black skins and woolly hair

the archipelago of the canaries was divided into several small
states hostile to each other and in many instances the same island
was subject to two independent princes the trading nations
influenced by the hideous policy still exercised on the coast of
africa kept up intestine warfare one guanche then became the
property of another who sold him to the europeans several who
preferred death to slavery killed themselves and their children
the population of the canaries had considerably suffered by the
slave trade by the depredations of pirates and especially by a
long period of carnage when alonzo de lugo completed the conquest
of the guanches the surviving remnants of the race perished mostly
in 1494 in the terrible pestilence called the modorra which was
attributed to the quantity of dead bodies left exposed in the open
air by the spaniards after the battle of la laguna the nation of
the guanches was extinct at the beginning of the seventeenth
century a few old men only were found at candelaria and guimar

it is however consoling to find that the whites have not always
disdained to intermarry with the natives but the canarians of the
present day whom the spaniards familiarly call islenos
(islanders) have very powerful motives for denying this mixture
in a long series of generations time effaces the characteristic
marks of a race and as the descendants of the andalusians settled
at teneriffe are themselves of dark complexion we may conceive
that intermarriages cannot have produced a perceptible change in
the colour of the whites it is very certain that no native of pure
race exists in the whole island it is true that a few canarian
families boast of their relationship to the last shepherd-king of
guimar but these pretensions do not rest on very solid
foundations and are only renewed from time to time when some
canarian of more dusky hue than his countrymen is prompted to
solicit a commission in the service of the king of spain

a short time after the discovery of america when spain was at the
highest pinnacle of her glory the gentle character of the guanches
was the fashionable topic as we in our times laud the arcadian
innocence of the inhabitants of otaheite in both these pictures
the colouring is more vivid than true when nations wearied with
mental enjoyments behold nothing in the refinement of manners but
the germ of depravity they are pleased with the idea that in some
distant region in the first dawn of civilization infant society
enjoys pure and perpetual felicity to this sentiment tacitus owed
a part of his success when he sketched for the romans subjects of
the caesars a picture of the manners of the inhabitants of
germany the same sentiment gives an ineffable charm to the
narrative of those travellers who at the close of the last
century visited the south sea islands

the inhabitants of those islands too much vaunted (and previously
anthropophagi) resemble under more than one point of view the
guanches of teneriffe both nations were under the yoke of feudal
government among the guanches this institution which facilitates
and renders a state of warfare perpetual was sanctioned by
religion the priests declared to the people "the great spirit
achaman created first the nobles the achimenceys to whom he
distributed all the goats that exist on the face of the earth
after the nobles achaman created the plebeians achicaxnas this
younger race had the boldness to petition also for goats but the
supreme spirit answered that this race was destined to serve the
nobles and that they had need of no property" this tradition was
made no doubt to please the rich vassals of the shepherd-kings
the faycan or high priest also exercised the right of conferring
nobility and the law of the guanches expressed that every
achimencey who degraded himself by milking a goat with his own
hands lost his claim to nobility this law does not remind us of
the simplicity of the homeric age we are astonished to see the
useful labours of agriculture and of pastoral life exposed to
contempt at the very dawn of civilization

the guanches famed for their tall stature were the patagonians of
the old world historians exaggerated the muscular strength of the
guanches as previous to the voyage of bougainville and cordoba
colossal proportions were attributed to the tribe that inhabited
the southern extremity of america i never saw guanche mummies but
in the cabinets of europe at the time i visited the canaries they
were very scarce a considerable number however might be found if
miners were employed to open the sepulchral caverns which are cut
in the rock on the eastern slope of the peak between arico and
guimar these mummies are in a state of desiccation so singular
that whole bodies with their integuments frequently do not weigh
above six or seven pounds or a third less than the skeleton of an
individual of the same size recently stripped of the muscular
flesh the conformation of the skull has some slight resemblance to
that of the white race of the ancient egyptians and the incisive
teeth of the guanches are blunted like those of the mummies found
on the banks of the nile but this form of teeth is the result of
art and on examining more carefully the physiognomy of the ancient
canarians blumenbach and other able anatomists have recognized in
the cheek bones and the lower jaw perceptible differences from the
egyptian mummies on opening those of the guanches remains of
aromatic plants are discovered among which the chenopodium
ambrosioides is constantly perceived the bodies are often
decorated with small laces to which are hung little discs of baked
earth which appear to have served as numerical signs and resemble
the quippoes of the peruvians the mexicans and the chinese

the population of islands being in general less exposed than that
of continents to the effect of migrations we may presume that in
the time of the carthaginians and the greeks the archipelago of
the canaries was inhabited by the same race of men as were found by
the norman and spanish conquerors the only monument that can throw
any light on the origin of the guanches is their language but
unhappily there are not above a hundred and fifty words extant and
several express the same object according to the dialect of the
different islanders independently of these words which have been
carefully noted there are still some valuable fragments existing
in the names of a great number of hamlets hills and valleys the
guanches like the biscayans the hindoos the peruvians and all
primitive nations named places after the quality of the soil the
shape of the rocks the caverns that gave them shelter and the
nature of the tree that overshadowed the springs*

(* it has been long imagined that the language of the guanches had
no analogy with the living tongues but since the travels of
hornemann and the ingenious researches of marsden and venturi
have drawn the attention of the learned to the berbers who like
the sarmatic tribes occupy an immense extent of country in the
north of africa we find that several guanche words have common
roots with words of the chilha and gebali dialects we shall cite
for instance the words

table of words

column 1 word

column 2 in guanche

column 3 in berberic

  heaven  tigo      tigot
  milk    aho       acho
  barley  temasen   tomzeen
  basket  carianas  carian
  water   aenum     anan

i doubt whether this analogy is a proof of a common origin but it
is an indication of the ancient connexion between the guanches and
berbers a tribe of mountaineers in which the ancient numidians
getuli and garamanti are confounded and who extend themselves
from the eastern extremity of atlas by harutsh and fezzan as far
as the oasis of siwah and augela the natives of the canary islands
called themselves guanches from guan man as the tonguese call
themselves bye and tongui which have the same signification as
guan besides the nations who speak the berberic language are not
all of the same race and the description which scylax gives in
his periplus of the inhabitants of cerne a shepherd people of
tall stature and long hair reminds us of the features which
characterize the canarian guanches)

the greater attention we direct to the study of languages in a
philosophical point of view the more we must observe that no one
of them is entirely distinct the language of the guanches would
appear still less so had we any data respecting its mechanism and
grammatical construction two elements more important than the form
of words and the identity of sounds it is the same with certain
idioms as with those organized beings that seem to shrink from all
classification in the series of natural families their isolated
state is merely apparent for it ceases when on embracing a
greater number of objects we come to discover the intermediate
links those learned enquirers who trace egyptians wherever there
are mummies hieroglyphics or pyramids will imagine perhaps that
the race of typhon was united to the guanches by the berbers real
atlantes to whom belong the tibboes and the tuarycks of the
desert but this hypothesis is supported by no analogy between the
berberic and coptic languages which are justly considered as
remnants of the ancient egyptian

the people who have succeeded the guanches are descended from the
spaniards and in a more remote degree from the normans though
these two races have been exposed during three centuries past to
the same climate the latter is distinguished by the fairer
complexion the descendants of the normans inhabit the valley of
teganana between punta de naga and punta de hidalgo the names of
grandville and dampierre are still pretty common in this district
the canarians are a moral sober and religious people of a less
industrious character at home than in foreign countries a roving
and enterprising disposition leads these islanders like the
biscayans and catalonians to the philippines to the ladrone
islands to america and wherever there are spanish settlements
from chile and la plata to new mexico to them we are in a great
measure indebted for the progress of agriculture in those colonies
the whole archipelago does not contain 160030 inhabitants and the
islenos are perhaps more numerous in the new continent than in
their own country


chapter 13

passage from tenerife to south america
the island of tobago
arrival at cumana

we left the road of santa cruz on the 25th of june and directed
our course towards south america we soon lost sight of the canary
islands the lofty mountains of which were covered with a reddish
vapour the peak alone appeared from time to time as at intervals
the wind dispersed the clouds that enveloped the piton we felt
for the first time how strong are the impressions left on the mind
from the aspect of those countries situated on the limits of the
torrid zone where nature appears at once so rich so various and
so majestic our stay at teneriffe had been very short and yet we
withdrew from the island as if it had long been our home

our passage from santa cruz to cumana the most eastern part of the
new continent was very fine we cut the tropic of cancer on the
27th and though the pizarro was not a very fast sailer we made
in twenty days the nine hundred leagues which separate the coast
of africa from that of the new continent we passed fifty leagues
west of cape bojador cape blanco and the cape verd islands a few
land birds which had been driven to sea by the impetuosity of the
wind followed us for several days

the latitude diminished rapidly from the parallel of madeira to
the tropic when we reached the zone where the trade-winds are
constant we crossed the ocean from east to west on a calm sea
which the spanish sailors call the ladies' gulf el golfo de las
damas in proportion as we advanced towards the west we found the
trade-winds fix to eastward

these winds the most generally adopted theory of which is
explained in a celebrated treatise of halley* are a phenomenon
much more complicated than most persons admit (* the existence of
an upper current of air which blows constantly from the equator to
the poles and of a lower current which blows from the poles to
the equator had already been admitted as m arago has shown by
hooke the ideas of the celebrated english naturalist are developed
in a discourse on earthquakes published in 1686 "i think (adds he)
that several phenomena which are presented by the atmosphere and
the ocean especially the winds may be explained by the polar
currents" hooke's posthumous works page 364) in the atlantic
ocean the longitude as well as the declination of the sun
influences the direction and limits of the trade-winds in the
direction of the new continent in both hemispheres these limits
extend beyond the tropics eight or nine degrees while in the
vicinity of africa the variable winds prevail far beyond the
parallel of 28 or 27 degrees it is to be regretted on account of
the progress of meteorology and navigation that the changes of the
currents of the equinoctial atmosphere in the pacific are much less
known than the variation of these same currents in a sea that is
narrower and influenced by the proximity of the coasts of guinea
and brazil the difference with which the strata of air flow back
from the two poles towards the equator cannot be the same in every
degree of longitude that is to say on points of the globe where
the continents are of very different breadths and where they
stretch away more or less towards the poles

it is known that in the passage from santa cruz to cumana as in
that from acapulco to the philippine islands seamen are scarcely
ever under the necessity of working their sails we pass those
latitudes as if we were descending a river and we might deem it no
hazardous undertaking if we made the voyage in an open boat
farther west on the coast of santa martha and in the gulf of
mexico the trade-wind blows impetuously and renders the sea very
stormy* (* the spanish sailors call the rough trade-winds at
carthagena in the west indies los brisotes de santa martha and in
the gulf of mexico las brizas pardas these latter winds are
accompanied with a grey and cloudy sky)

the wind fell gradually the farther we receded from the african
coast it was sometimes smooth water for several hours and these
short calms were regularly interrupted by electrical phenomena
black thick clouds marked by strong outlines rose on the east
and it seemed as if a squall would have forced us to hand our
topsails but the breeze freshened anew there fell a few large
drops of rain and the storm dispersed without our hearing any
thunder meanwhile it was curious to observe the effect of several
black isolated and very low clouds which passed the zenith we
felt the force of the wind augment or diminish progressively
according as small bodies of vesicular vapour approached or
receded while the electrometers furnished with a long metallic
rod and lighted match showed no change of electric tension in the
lower strata of the air it is by help of these squalls which
alternate with dead calms that the passage from the canary islands
to the antilles or southern coast of america is made in the
months of june and july

some spanish navigators have lately proposed going to the west
indies and the coasts of terra firma by a course different from
that which was taken by columbus they advise instead of steering
directly to the south in search of the trade-winds to change both
latitude and longitude in a diagonal line from cape st vincent to
america this method which shortens the way cutting the tropic
nearly twenty degrees west of the point where it is commonly cut by
pilots was several times successfully adopted by admiral gravina
that able commander who fell at the battle of trafalgar arrived
in 1802 at st domingo by the oblique passage several days before
the french fleet though orders of the court of madrid would have
forced him to enter ferrol with his squadron and stop there some
time

this new system of navigation shortens the passage from cadiz to
cumana one-twentieth but as the tropic is attained only at the
longitude of forty degrees the chance of meeting with contrary
winds which blow sometimes from the south and at other times from
the south-west is more unfavourable in the old system the
disadvantage of making a longer passage is compensated by the
certainty of catching the trade-winds in a shorter space of time
and keeping them the greater part of the passage at the time of my
abode in the spanish colonies i witnessed the arrival of several
merchant-ships which from the fear of privateers had chosen the
oblique course and had had a very short passage

nothing can equal the beauty and mildness of the climate of the
equinoctial region on the ocean while the trade wind blew
strongly the thermometer kept at 23 or 24 degrees in the day and
at 22 or 225 degrees during the night the charm of the lovely
climates bordering on the equator can be fully enjoyed only by
those who have undertaken the voyage from acapulco or the coasts of
chile to europe in a very rough season what a contrast between the
tempestuous seas of the northern latitudes and the regions where
the tranquillity of nature is never disturbed if the return from
mexico or south america to the coasts of spain were as expeditious
and as agreeable as the passage from the old to the new continent
the number of europeans settled in the colonies would be much less
considerable than it is at present to the sea which surrounds the
azores and the bermuda islands and which is traversed in returning
to europe by the high latitudes the spaniards have given the
singular name of golfo de las yeguas (the mares' gulf) colonists
who are not accustomed to the sea and who have led solitary lives
in the forests of guiana the savannahs of the caracas or the
cordilleras of peru dread the vicinity of the bermudas more than
the inhabitants of lima fear at present the passage round cape
horn

to the north of the cape verd islands we met with great masses of
floating seaweeds they were the tropic grape (fucus natans)
which grows on submarine rocks only from the equator to the
fortieth degree of north and south latitude these weeds seem to
indicate the existence of currents in this place as well as to
south-west of the banks of newfoundland we must not confound the
latitudes abounding in scattered weeds with those banks of marine
plants which columbus compares to extensive meadows the sight of
which dismayed the crew of the santa maria in the forty-second
degree of longitude i am convinced from the comparison of a great
number of journals that in the basin of the northern atlantic
there exist two banks of weeds very different from each other the
most extensive is a little west of the meridian of fayal one of
the azores between the twenty-fifth and thirty-sixth degrees of
latitude* (* it would appear that phoenician vessels came "in
thirty days' sail with an easterly wind" to the weedy sea which
the portuguese and spaniards call mar de zargasso i have shown in
another place (views of nature bohn's edition page 46) that the
passage of aristotle de mirabil (ed duval page 1157) can
scarcely be applied to the coasts of africa like an analogous
passage of the periplus of scylax supposing that this sea full of
weeds which impeded the course of the phoenician vessels was the
mar de zargasso we need not admit that the ancients navigated the
atlantic beyond thirty degrees of west longitude from the meridian
of paris) the temperature of the atlantic in those latitudes is
from sixteen to twenty degrees and the north winds which
sometimes rage there very tempestuously drive floating isles of
seaweed into the low latitudes as far as the parallels of
twenty-four and even twenty degrees vessels returning to europe
either from monte video or the cape of good hope cross these banks
of fucus which the spanish pilots consider as at an equal distance
from the antilles and canaries and they serve the less instructed
mariner to rectify his longitude the second bank of fucus is but
little known it occupies a much smaller space in the
twenty-second and twenty-sixth degrees of latitude eighty leagues
west of the meridian of the bahama islands it is found on the
passage from the caiques to the bermudas

though a species of seaweed* (* the baudreux of the falkland
islands fucus giganteus forster laminaria pyrifera lamour) has
been seen with stems eight hundred feet long the growth of these
marine cryptogamia being extremely rapid it is nevertheless
certain that in the latitudes we have just described the fuci
far from being fixed to the bottom float in separate masses on the
surface of the water in this state the vegetation can scarcely
last longer than it would in the branch of a tree torn from its
trunk and in order to explain how moving masses are found for ages
in the same position we must admit that they owe their origin to
submarine rocks which lying at forty or sixty fathoms' depth
continually supply what has been carried away by the equinoctial
currents this current bears the tropic grape into the high
latitudes toward the coasts of norway and france and it is not
the gulf-stream as some mariners think which accumulates the
fucus to the south of the azores

the causes that unroot these weeds at depths where it is generally
thought the sea is but slightly agitated are not sufficiently
known we learn only from the observations of m lamouroux that
if the fucus adhere to the rocks with the greatest firmness before
its fructification it separates with great facility after that
period or during the season which suspends its vegetation like
that of the terrestrial plants the fish and mollusca which gnaw
the stems of the seaweeds no doubt contribute also to detach them
from their roots

from the twenty-second degree of latitude we found the surface of
the sea covered with flying-fish* (* exocoetus volitans) which
threw themselves up into the air twelve fifteen or eighteen
feet and fell down on the deck i do not hesitate to speak on a
subject of which voyagers discourse as frequently as of dolphins
sharks sea-sickness and the phosphorescence of the ocean none of
these topics can fail to afford interesting observations to
naturalists provided they make them their particular study nature
is an inexhaustible source of investigation and in proportion as
the domain of science is extended she presents herself to those
who know how to interrogate her under forms which they have never
yet examined

i have named the flying-fish in order to direct the attention of
naturalists to the enormous size of their natatory bladder which
in an animal of 64 inches is 36 inches long 09 of an inch
broad and contains three cubic inches and a half of air as this
bladder occupies more than half the size of the fish it is
probable that it contributes to its lightness we may assert that
this reservoir of air is more fitted for flying than swimming for
the experiments made by m provenzal and myself have proved that
even in the species which are provided with this organ it is not
indispensably necessary for the ascending movement to the surface
of the water in a young flying-fish 58 inches long each of the
pectoral fins which serve as wings presented a surface to the air
of 3 7/16 square inches we observed that the nine branches of
nerves which go to the twelve rays of these fins are almost three
times the size of the nerves that belong to the ventral fins when
the former of these nerves are excited by galvanic electricity the
rays which support the membrane of the pectoral fin extend with
five times the force with which the other fins move when galvanised
by the same metals thus the fish is capable of throwing itself
horizontally the distance of twenty feet before retouching the
water with the extremity of its fins this motion has been aptly
compared to that of a flat stone which thrown horizontally
bounds one or two feet above the water notwithstanding the extreme
rapidity of this motion it is certain that the animal beats the
air during the leap that is it alternately extends and closes its
pectoral fins the same motion has been observed in the flying
scorpion of the rivers of japan they also contain a large
air-bladder with which the great part of the scorpions that have
not the faculty of flying are unprovided the flying-fish like
almost all animals which have gills enjoy the power of equal
respiration for a long time both in water and in air by the same
organs that is by extracting the oxygen from the atmosphere as
well as from the water in which it is dissolved they pass a great
part of their life in the air but if they escape from the sea to
avoid the voracity of the dorado they meet in the air the
frigate-bird the albatross and others which seize them in their
flight thus on the banks of the orinoco herds of the cabiai
which rush from the water to escape the crocodile become the prey
of the jaguar which awaits their arrival

i doubt however whether the flying-fish spring out of the water
merely to escape the pursuit of their enemies like swallows they
move by thousands in a right line and in a direction constantly
opposite to that of the waves in our own climates on the brink of
a river illumined by the rays of the sun we often see solitary
fish fearlessly bound above the surface as if they felt pleasure in
breathing the air why should not these gambols be more frequent
with the flying-fish which from the strength of their pectoral
fins and the smallness of their specific gravity can so easily
support themselves in the air? i invite naturalists to examine
whether other flying-fish for instance the exocoetus exiliens the
trigla volitans amid the t hirundo have as capacious an
air-bladder as the flying-fish of the tropics this last follows
the heated waters of the gulf-stream when they flow northward the
cabin-boys amuse themselves with cutting off a part of the pectoral
fins and assert that these wings grow again which seems to me
not unlikely from facts observed in other families of fishes

at the time i left paris experiments made at jamaica by dr
brodbelt on the air contained in the natatory bladder of the
sword-fish had led some naturalists to think that within the
tropics in sea-fish that organ must be filled with pure oxygen
gas full of this idea i was surprised at finding in the
air-bladder of the flying-fish only 004 of oxygen to 094 of azote
and 002 of carbonic acid the proportion of this last gas
measured by the absorption of lime-water in graduated tubes
appeared more uniform than that of the oxygen of which some
individuals yielded almost double the quantity from the curious
phenomena observed by mm biot configliachi and delaroche we
might suppose that the swordfish dissected by dr brodbelt had
inhabited the lower strata of the ocean where some fish* have as
much as 092 of oxygen in the air-bladder (* trigla cucullus)

on the 3rd and 4th of july we crossed that part of the atlantic
where the charts indicate the bank of the maal-stroom and towards
night we altered our course to avoid the danger the existence of
which is however as doubtful as that of the isles fonseco and st
anne it would have been perhaps as prudent to have continued our
course the old charts are filled with rocks some of which really
exist though most of them are merely the offspring of those
optical illusions which are more frequent at sea than in inland
places as we approached the supposed maal-stroom we observed no
other motion in the waters than the effect of a current which bore
to the north-west and which hindered us from diminishing our
latitude as much as we wished the force of this current augments
as we approach the new continent it is modified by the
configuration of the coasts of brazil and guiana and not by the
waters of the orinoco and the amazon as some have supposed

from the time we entered the torrid zone we were never weary of
admiring at night the beauty of the southern sky which as we
advanced to the south opened new constellations to our view we
feel an indescribable sensation when on approaching the equator
and particularly on passing from one hemisphere to the other we
see those stars which we have contemplated from our infancy
progressively sink and finally disappear nothing awakens in the
traveller a livelier remembrance of the immense distance by which
he is separated from his country than the aspect of an unknown
firmament the grouping of the stars of the first magnitude some
scattered nebulae rivalling in splendour the milky way and tracts
of space remarkable for their extreme blackness give a peculiar
physiognomy to the southern sky this sight fills with admiration
even those who uninstructed in the several branches of physical
science feel the same emotion of delight in the contemplation of
the heavenly vault as in the view of a beautiful landscape or a
majestic site a traveller needs not to be a botanist to recognize
the torrid zone by the mere aspect of its vegetation without
having acquired any notions of astronomy without any acquaintance
with the celestial charts of flamsteed and de la caille he feels
he is not in europe when he sees the immense constellation of the
ship or the phosphorescent clouds of magellan arise on the
horizon the heavens and the earth everything in the equinoctial
regions presents an exotic character

the lower regions of the air were loaded with vapours for some
days we saw distinctly for the first time the southern cross only
on the night of the 4th of july in the sixteenth degree of
latitude it was strongly inclined and appeared from time to time
between the clouds the centre of which furrowed by uncondensed
lightnings reflected a silvery light if a traveller may be
permitted to speak of his personal emotions i shall add that on
that night i experienced the realization of one of the dreams of my
early youth

when we begin to fix our eyes on geographical maps and to read the
narratives of navigators we feel for certain countries and
climates a sort of predilection which we know not how to account
for at a more advanced period of life these impressions however
exercise a considerable influence over our determinations and from
a sort of instinct we endeavour to connect ourselves with objects
on which the mind has long been fixed as by a secret charm at a
period when i studied the heavens not with the intention of
devoting myself to astronomy but only to acquire a knowledge of
the stars i was disturbed by a feeling unknown to those who are
devoted to sedentary life it was painful to me to renounce the
hope of beholding the beautiful constellations near the south pole
impatient to rove in the equinoctial regions i could not raise my
eyes to the starry firmament without thinking of the southern
cross and recalling the sublime passage of dante which the most
celebrated commentators have applied to that constellation 

    io mi volsi a man' destra e posi mente
    all' altro polo e vidi quattro stelle
    non viste mai fuorch' alla prima gente

    goder parea lo ciel di lor fiammelle
    o settentrional vedovo sito
    poiche privato sei di mirar quelle

the pleasure we felt on discovering the southern cross was warmly
shared by those of the crew who had visited the colonies in the
solitude of the seas we hail a star as a friend from whom we have
long been separated the portuguese and the spaniards are
peculiarly susceptible of this feeling a religious sentiment
attaches them to a constellation the form of which recalls the
sign of the faith planted by their ancestors in the deserts of the
new world

the two great stars which mark the summit and the foot of the cross
having nearly the same right ascension it follows that the
constellation is almost perpendicular at the moment when it passes
the meridian this circumstance is known to the people of every
nation situated beyond the tropics or in the southern hemisphere
it has been observed at what hour of the night in different
seasons the cross is erect or inclined it is a timepiece which
advances very regularly nearly four minutes a-day and no other
group of stars affords to the naked eye an observation of time so
easily made how often have we heard our guides exclaim in the
savannahs of venezuela or in the desert extending from lima to
truxillo "midnight is past the cross begins to bend" how often
those words reminded us of that affecting scene where paul and
virginia seated near the source of the river of lataniers
conversed together for the last time and where the old man at the
sight of the southern cross warns them that it is time to
separate

the last days of our passage were not so felicitous as the mildness
of the climate and the calmness of the ocean had led us to hope
the dangers of the sea did not disturb us but the germs of a
malignant fever became manifest on board our vessel as we drew near
the antilles between decks the ship was excessively hot and very
much crowded from the time we passed the tropic the thermometer
was at thirty-four or thirty-six degrees two sailors several
passengers and what is remarkable enough two negroes from the
coast of guinea and a mulatto child were attacked with a disorder
which appeared to be epidemic the symptoms were not equally
alarming in all the cases nevertheless several persons and
especially the most robust fell into delirium after the second
day no fumigation was made a gallician surgeon ignorant and
phlegmatic ordered bleedings because he attributed the fever to
what he called heat and corruption of the blood there was not an
ounce of bark on board for we had emitted to take any with us
under the impression that this salutary production of peru could
not fail to be found on board a spanish vessel

on the 8th of july a sailor who was near expiring recovered his
health from a circumstance worthy of being mentioned his hammock
was so hung that there was not ten inches between his face and the
deck it was impossible to administer the sacrament in this
situation for agreeably to the custom on board spanish vessels
the viaticum must be carried by the light of tapers and followed
by the whole crew the patient was removed into an airy place near
the hatchway where a small square berth had been formed with
sailcloth here he was to remain till he died which was an event
expected every moment but passing from an atmosphere heated
stagnant and filled with miasma into fresher and purer air which
was renewed every instant he gradually revived from his lethargic
state his recovery dated from the day when he quitted the middle
deck and as it often happens in medicine that the same facts are
cited in support of systems diametrically opposite this recovery
confirmed our doctor in his idea of the inflammation of the blood
and the necessity of bleeding evacuating and all the asthenic
remedies we soon felt the fatal effects of this treatment

for several days the pilot's reckoning differed 1 degree 12 minutes
in longitude from that of my time this difference was owing less
to the general current which i have called the current of
rotation than to that particular movement which drawing the
waters toward the north-west from the coast of brazil to the
antilles shortens the passage from cayenne to guadaloupe* (* in
the atlantic ocean there is a space where the water is constantly
milky though the sea is very deep this curious phenomenon exists
in the parallel of the island of dominica very near the 57th
degree of longitude may there not be in this place some sunken
volcanic islet more easterly still than barbadoes?) on the 12th of
july i thought i might foretell our seeing land next day before
sunrise we were then according to my observations in latitude 10
degrees 46 minutes and west longitude 60 degrees 54 minutes a few
series of lunar distances confirmed the chronometrical result but
we were surer of the position of the vessel than of that of the
land to which we were directing our course and which was so
differently marked in the french spanish and english charts the
longitudes deduced from the accurate observations of messrs
churruca fidalgo and noguera were not then published

the pilots trusted more to the log than the timekeeper they smiled
at the prediction of so speedily making land and thought
themselves two or three days' sail from the coast it was therefore
with great pleasure that on the 13th about six in the morning i
learned that very high land was seen from the mast-head though not
clearly as it was surrounded with a thick fog the wind blew hard
and the sea was very rough large drops of rain fell at intervals
and every indication menaced tempestuous weather the captain of
the pizarro intended to pass through the channel which separates
the islands of tobago and trinidad and knowing that our sloop was
very slow in tacking he was afraid of falling to leeward towards
the south and approaching the boca del drago we were in fact
surer of our longitude than of our latitude having had no
observation at noon since the 11th double altitudes which i took
in the morning after douwes's method placed us in 11 degrees 6
minutes 50 seconds consequently 15 minutes north of our reckoning
though the result clearly proved that the high land on the horizon
was not trinidad but tobago yet the captain continued to steer
north-north-west in search of this latter island

an observation of the meridian altitude of the sun fully confirmed
the latitude obtained by douwes's method no more doubt remained as
to the position of the vessel with respect to the island and we
resolved to double cape north (tobago) to pass between that island
and grenada and steer towards a port in margareta

the island of tobago presents a very picturesque aspect it is
merely a heap of rocks carefully cultivated the dazzling whiteness
of the stone forms an agreeable contrast to the verdure of some
scattered tufts of trees cylindric and very lofty cactuses crown
the top of the mountains and give a peculiar physiognomy to this
tropical landscape the sight of the trees alone is sufficient to
remind the navigator that he has reached an american coast for
these cactuses are as exclusively peculiar to the new world as the
heaths are to the old

we crossed the shoal which joins tobago to the island of grenada
the colour of the sea presented no visible change but the
centigrade thermometer plunged into the water to the depth of some
inches rose only to 23 degrees while farther at sea eastward on
the same parallel and equally near the surface it kept at 256
degrees notwithstanding the currents the cooling of the water
indicated the existence of the shoal which is noted in only a very
few charts the wind slackened after sunset and the clouds
disappeared as the moon reached the zenith the number of falling
stars was very considerable on this and the following nights they
appeared less frequent towards the north than the south over terra
firma which we began to coast this position seems to prove the
influence of local causes on meteors the nature of which is not
yet sufficiently known to us

on the 14th at sunrise we were in sight of the boca del drago we
distinguished chacachacarreo the most westerly of the islands
situated between cape paria and the north-west cape of trinidad
when we were five leagues distant from the coast we felt near
punta de la boca the effect of a particular current which carried
the ship southward the motion of the waters which flow through the
boca del draco and the action of the tides occasion an eddy we
cast the lead and found from thirty-six to forty-three fathoms on
a bottom of very fine green clay according to the rules
established by dampier we ought not to have expected so little
depth near a coast formed by very high and perpendicular mountains
we continued to heave the lead till we reached cabo de tres
puntas* (* cape three points the name given to it by columbus) and
we every where found shallow water apparently indicating the
prolongation of the ancient coast in these latitudes the
temperature of the sea was from twenty-three to twenty-four
degrees consequently from 15 to two degrees lower than in the
open ocean beyond the edge of the bank

the cabo de tres puntas is according to my observations in 65
degrees 4 minutes 5 seconds longitude it seemed to us the more
elevated as the clouds concealed the view of its indented top
the aspect of the mountains of paria their colour and especially
their generally rounded forms made us suspect that the coast was
granitic but we afterwards recognized how delusive even to those
who have passed their lives in scaling mountains are impressions
respecting the nature of rocks seen at a distance

a dead calm which lasted several hours permitted us to determine
with exactness the intensity of the magnetic forces opposite the
cabo de tres puntas this intensity was greater than in the open
sea to the east of the island of tobago in the ratio of from 237
to 229 during the calm the current drew us on rapidly to the west
its velocity was three miles an hour and it increased as we
approached the meridian of testigos a heap of rocks which rises up
amidst the waters at the setting of the moon the sky was covered
with clouds the wind freshened anew and the rain descended in one
of those torrents peculiar to the torrid zone

the malady which had broken out on board the pizarro had made rapid
progress from the time when we approached the coasts of terra
firma but having then almost reached the end of our voyage we
flattered ourselves that all who were sick would be restored to
health as soon as we could land them at the island of st
margareta or the port of cumana places remarkable for their great
salubrity

this hope was unfortunately not realised the youngest of the
passengers attacked with the malignant fever fell a victim to the
disease he was an asturian nineteen years of age the only son of
a poor widow several circumstances rendered the death of this
young man affecting his countenance bore the expression of
sensibility and great mildness of disposition he had embarked
against his own inclination and his mother whom he had hoped to
assist by the produce of his efforts had made a sacrifice of her
affection in the hope of securing the fortune of her son by
sending him to the colonies to a rich relation who resided at the
island of cuba the unfortunate young man expired on the third day
of his illness having fallen from the beginning into a lethargic
state interrupted only by fits of delirium the yellow fever or
black vomit at vera cruz scarcely carries off the sick with so
alarming a rapidity another asturian still younger did not leave
for one moment the bed of his dying friend and what is very
remarkable did not contract the disorder

we were assembled on the deck absorbed in melancholy reflections
it was no longer doubtful that the fever which raged on board had
assumed within the last few days a fatal aspect our eyes were
fixed on a hilly and desert coast on which the moon from time to
time shed her light athwart the clouds the sea gently agitated
emitted a feeble phosphoric light nothing was heard but the
monotonous cry of a few large sea-birds flying towards the shore
a profound calm reigned over these solitary regions but this calm
of nature was in discordance with the painful feelings by which we
were oppressed about eight o'clock the dead man's knell was slowly
tolled at this lugubrious sound the sailors suspended their
labours and threw themselves on their knees to offer a momentary
prayer an affecting ceremony which brought to our remembrance
those times when the primitive christians all considered themselves
as members of the same family all were united in one common sorrow
for a misfortune which was felt to be common to all the corpse of
the young asturian was brought upon deck during the night but the
priest entreated that it might not be committed to the waves till
after sunrise that the last rites might be performed according to
the usage of the romish church there was not an individual on
board who did not deplore the death of this young man whom we had
beheld but a few days before full of cheerfulness and health

those among the passengers who had not yet felt symptoms of the
disease resolved to leave the vessel at the first place where she
might touch and await the arrival of another packet to pursue
their course to the island of cuba and to mexico they considered
the between-decks of the ship as infected and though it was by no
means clear to me that the fever was contagious i thought it most
prudent to land at cumana i wished not to visit new spain till i
had made some sojourn on the coasts of venezuela and paria a few
of the productions of which had been examined by the unfortunate
loefling we were anxious to behold in their native site the
beautiful plants which bose and bredemeyer had collected during
their journey to the continent and which adorn the conservatories
of schoenbrunn and vienna it would have been painful to have
touched at cumana or at guayra without visiting the interior of a
country so little frequented by naturalists

the resolution we formed during the night of the 14th of july had
a happy influence on the direction of our travels for instead of a
few weeks we remained a whole year in this part of the continent
had not the fever broken out on board the pizarro we should never
have reached the orinoco the cassiquiare or even the limits of
the portuguese possessions on the rio negro to this direction
given to our travels we were perhaps also indebted for the good
health we enjoyed during so long an abode in the equinoctial
regions

it is well known that europeans during the first months after
their arrival under the scorching sky of the tropics are exposed
to the greatest dangers they consider themselves to be safe when
they have passed the rainy season in the west india islands at
vera cruz or at carthagena this opinion is very general although
there are examples of persons who having escaped a first attack
of the yellow fever have fallen victims to the same disease in one
of the following years the facility of becoming acclimated seems
to be in the inverse ratio of the difference that exists between
the mean temperature of the torrid zone and that of the native
country of the traveller or colonist who changes his climate
because the irritability of the organs and their vital action are
powerfully modified by the influence of the atmospheric heat a
prussian a pole or a swede is more exposed on his arrival at the
islands or on the continent than a spaniard an italian or even
an inhabitant of the south of france with respect to the people of
the north the difference of the mean temperature is from nineteen
to twenty-one degrees while to the people of southern countries it
is only from nine to ten we were fortunate enough to pass safely
through the interval during which a european recently landed runs
the greatest danger in the extremely hot but very dry climate of
cumana a city celebrated for its salubrity

on the morning of the 15th when nearly on a line with the hill of
st joseph we were surrounded by a great quantity of floating
seaweed its stems had those extraordinary appendages in the form
of little cups and feathers which don hippolyto ruiz remarked on
his return from the expedition to chile and which he described in
a separate memoir as the generative organs of the fucus natans a
fortunate accident allowed us the means of verifying a fact which
had been but once observed by naturalists the bundles of fucus
collected by m bonpland were completely identical with the
specimens given us by the learned authors of the flora of peru on
examining both with the microscope we found that the supposed
parts of fructification the stamina and pistils belong to a new
genus of the family of the ceratophytae

the coast of paria stretches to the west forming a wall of rocks
of no great height with rounded tops and a waving outline we were
long without perceiving the bold coasts of the island of margareta
where we were to stop for the purpose of ascertaining whether we
could touch at guayra we had learned by altitudes of the sun
taken under very favourable circumstances how incorrect at that
period were the most highly-esteemed marine charts on the morning
of the 15th when the time-keeper placed us in 66 degrees 1 minute
15 seconds longitude we were not yet in the meridian of margareta
island though according to the reduced chart of the atlantic ocean
we ought to have passed the very lofty western cape of this island
which is laid down in longitude 66 degrees 0 minutes the
inaccuracy with which the coasts were delineated previously to the
labours of fidalgo noguera and tiscar and i may venture to add
before the astronomical observations i made at cumana might have
become dangerous to navigators were not the sea uniformly calm in
those regions the errors in latitude were still greater than those
in longitude for the coasts of new andalusia stretch to the
westward of cape three points (or tres puntas) fifteen or twenty
miles more to the north than appears in the charts published
before the year 1800

about eleven in the morning we perceived a very low islet covered
with a few sandy downs and on which we discovered with our glasses
no trace of habitation or culture cylindrical cactuses rose here
and there in the form of candelabra the soil almost destitute of
vegetation seemed to have a waving motion in consequence of the
extraordinary refraction which the rays of the sun undergo in
traversing the strata of air in contact with plains strongly
heated under every zone deserts and sandy shores appear like an
agitated sea from the effect of mirage

the coasts seen at a distance are like clouds in which each
observer meets the form of the objects that occupy his imagination
our bearings and our chronometer being at variance with the charts
which we had to consult we were lost in vain conjectures some
took mounds of sand for indian huts and pointed out the place
where they alleged the fort of pampatar was situated others saw
herds of goats which are so common in the dry valley of st john
or descried the lofty mountains of macanao which seemed to them
partly hidden by the clouds the captain resolved to send a pilot
on shore and the men were preparing to get out the long-boat when
we perceived two canoes sailing along the coast we fired a gun as
a signal for them and though we had hoisted spanish colours they
drew near with distrust these canoes like all those in use among
the natives were constructed of the single trunk of a tree in
each canoe there were eighteen guayqueria indians naked to the
waist and of very tall stature they had the appearance of great
muscular strength and the colour of their skin was something
between brown and copper-colour seen at a distance standing
motionless and projected on the horizon they might have been
taken for statues of bronze we were the more struck with their
appearance as it did not correspond with the accounts given by
some travellers respecting the characteristic features and extreme
feebleness of the natives we afterwards learned without passing
the limits of the province of cumana the great contrast existing
between the physiognomy of the guayquerias and that of the chaymas
and the caribs

when we were near enough to hail them in spanish the indians threw
aside their mistrust and came straight on board they informed us
that the low islet near which we were at anchor was coche which
had never been inhabited and that spanish vessels coming from
europe were accustomed to sail farther north between this island
and that of margareta to take a coasting pilot at the port of
pampatar our inexperience had led us into the channel to the south
of coche and as at that period the english cruisers frequented
this passage the indians had at first taken us for an enemy's
ship the southern passage is in fact highly advantageous for
vessels going to cumana and barcelona the water is less deep than
in the northern passage which is much narrower but there is no
risk of touching the ground if vessels keep very close to the
island of lobos and the moros del tunal the channel between coche
and margareta is narrowed by the shoals off the north-west cape of
coche and by the bank that surrounds la punta de los mangles

the guayquerias belong to that tribe of civilized indians who
inhabit the coasts of margareta and the suburbs of the city of
cumana next to the caribs of spanish guiana they are the finest
race of men in terra firma they enjoy several privileges because
from the earliest times of the conquest they remained faithful
friends to the castilians the king of spain styles them in his
public acts "his dear noble and loyal guayquerias" the indians
of the two canoes we had met had left the port of cumana during the
night they were going in search of timber to the forests of cedar
(cedrela odorata linn) which extend from cape san jose to beyond
the mouth of rio carupano they gave us some fresh cocoa-nuts and
very beautifully coloured fish of the chaetodon genus what riches
to our eyes were contained in the canoes of these poor indians
broad spreading leaves of vijao* (* heliconia bihai) covered
bunches of plantains the scaly cuirass of an armadillo (dasypus)
the fruit of the calabash tree (crescentia cujete) used as a cup
by the natives productions common in the cabinets of europe had a
peculiar charm for us because they reminded us that having
reached the torrid zone we had attained the end to which our
wishes had been so long directed

the master of one of the canoes offered to remain on board the
pizarro as coasting pilot (practico) he was a guayqueria of an
excellent disposition sagacious in his observations and he had
been led by intelligent curiosity to notice the productions of the
sea as well as the plants of the country by a fortunate chance
the first indian we met on our arrival was the man whose
acquaintance became the most useful to us in the course of our
researches i feel a pleasure in recording in this itinerary the
name of carlos del pino who during the space of sixteen months
attended us in our course along the coasts and into the inland
country

the captain of the corvette weighed anchor towards evening before
we left the shoal or placer of coche i ascertained the longitude
of the east cape of the island which i found to be 66 degrees 11
minutes 53 seconds as we steered westward we soon came in sight
of the little island of cubagua now entirely deserted but formerly
celebrated for its fishery of pearls there the spaniards
immediately after the voyages of columbus and ojeda founded under
the name of new cadiz a town of which there now remains no
vestige at the beginning of the sixteenth century the pearls of
cubagua were known at seville at toledo and at the great fairs of
augsburg and bruges new cadiz having no water that of the rio
manzanares was conveyed thither from the neighbouring coast though
for some reason i know not what it was thought to be the cause of
diseases of the eyes the writers of that period all speak of the
riches of the first planters and the luxury they displayed at
present downs of shifting sand cover this uninhabited land and
the name of cubagua is scarcely found in our charts

having reached these latitudes we saw the high mountains of cape
macanao on the western side of the island of margareta which rose
majestically on the horizon if we might judge from the angles of
altitude of the tops taken at eighteen miles' distance they
appeared to be about 500 or 600 toises high according to
berthoud's time-keeper the longitude of cape macanao is 66 degrees
47 minutes 5 seconds i speak of the rocks at the extremity of the
cape and not that strip of very low land which stretches to the
west and loses itself in a shoal the position of macanao and that
which i have assigned to the east point of the island of coche
differ only four seconds in time from the results obtained by
m fidalgo

there being little wind the captain preferred standing off and on
till daybreak we passed a part of the night on deck the
guayqueria pilot conversed with us respecting the animals and
plants of his country we learned with great satisfaction that
there was a few leagues from the coast a mountainous region
inhabited by the spaniards in which the cold was sensibly felt
and that in the plains there were two species of crocodiles very
different from each other besides boas electric eels and
several kinds of tigers though the words bava cachicamo and
temblador were entirely unknown to us we easily guessed from the
pilot's simple description of their manners and forms the species
which the creoles distinguished by these denominations


chapter 14

first abode at cumana
banks of the manzanares

on the 16th of july 1799 at break of day we beheld a verdant
coast of picturesque aspect the mountains of new andalusia
half-veiled by mists bounded the horizon to the south the city of
cumana and its castle appeared between groups of cocoa-trees we
anchored in the port about nine in the morning forty-one days
after our departure from corunna the sick dragged themselves on
deck to enjoy the sight of a land which was to put an end to their
sufferings our eyes were fixed on the groups of cocoa-trees which
border the river their trunks more than sixty feet high towered
over every object in the landscape the plain was covered with the
tufts of cassia caper and those arborescent mimosas which like
the pine of italy spread their branches in the form of an
umbrella the pinnated leaves of the palms were conspicuous on the
azure sky the clearness of which was unsullied by any trace of
vapour the sun was ascending rapidly toward the zenith a dazzling
light was spread through the air along the whitish hills strewed
with cylindric cactuses and over a sea ever calm the shores of
which were peopled with alcatras* (* a brown pelican of the size
of a swan (pelicanus fuscus linn)) egrets and flamingoes the
splendour of the day the vivid colouring of the vegetable world
the forms of the plants the varied plumage of the birds
everything was stamped with the grand character of nature in the
equinoctial regions

the city of cumana the capital of new andalusia is a mile distant
from the embarcadero or the battery of the boca where we landed
after having passed the bar of the manzanares we had to cross a
vast plain called el salado which divides the suburb of the
guayquerias from the sea-coast the excessive heat of the
atmosphere was augmented by the reverberation of the soil partly
destitute of vegetation the centigrade thermometer plunged into
the white sand rose to 377 degrees in the small pools of salt
water it kept at 305 degrees while the heat of the ocean at its
surface is generally in the port of cumana from 252 to 263
degrees the first plant we gathered on the continent of america
was the avicennia tomentosa8 (* mangle prieto) which in this
place scarcely reaches two feet in height this shrub together
with the sesuvium the yellow gomphrena and the cactus cover soil
impregnated with muriate of soda they belong to that small number
of plants which live in society like the heath of europe and which
in the torrid zone are found only on the seashore and on the
elevated plains of the andes* (* on the extreme rarity of the
social plants in the tropics see my essay on the geog of plants
page 19 and a paper by mr brown on the proteacea transactions of
the lin soc volume 10 page 1 page 23 in which that great
botanist has extended and confirmed by numerous facts my ideas on
the association of plants of the same species) the avicennia of
cumana is distinguished by another peculiarity not less remarkable
it furnishes an instance of a plant common to the shores of south
america and the coasts of malabar

the indian pilot led us across his garden which rather resembled a
copse than a piece of cultivated ground he showed us as a proof
of the fertility of this climate a silk-cotton tree (bombax
heptaphyllum) the trunk of which in its fourth year had reached
nearly two feet and a half in diameter we have observed on the
banks of the orinoco and the river magdalena that the bombax the
carolinea the ochroma and other trees of the family of the
malvaceae are of extremely rapid growth i nevertheless think that
there was some exaggeration in the report of the indian respecting
the age of his bombax for under the temperate zone in the hot and
damp lands of north america between the mississippi and the
alleghany mountains the trees do not exceed a foot in diameter in
ten years vegetation in those parts is in general but a fifth more
speedy than in europe even taking as an example the platanus
occidentalis the tulip tree and the cupressus disticha which
reach from nine to fifteen feet in diameter on the strand of
cumana in the garden of the guayqueria pilot we saw for the first
time a guama* loaded with flowers and remarkable for the extreme
length and silvery splendour of its numerous stamina (* inga
spuria which we must not confound with the common inga inga vera
willd (mimosa inga linn) the white stamina which to the
number of sixty or seventy are attached to a greenish corolla
have a silky lustre and are terminated by a yellow anther the
flower of the guama is eighteen lines long the common height of
this fine tree which prefers a moist soil is from eight to ten
toises) we crossed the suburb of the guayqueria indians the
streets of which are very regular and formed of small houses
quite new and of a pleasing appearance this part of the town had
just been rebuilt for the earthquake had laid cumana in ruins
eighteen months before our arrival by a wooden bridge we crossed
the river manzanares which contains a few bavas or crocodiles of
the smaller species

we were conducted by the captain of the pizarro to the governor of
the province don vincente emparan to present to him the passports
furnished to us by the first secretary of state at madrid he
received us with that frankness and unaffected dignity which have
at all times characterized the natives of biscay before he was
appointed governor of portobello and cumana don vincente emparan
had distinguished himself as captain of a vessel in the navy his
name recalls to mind one of the most extraordinary and distressing
events recorded in the history of maritime warfare at the time of
the last rupture between spain and england two brothers of senor
emperan both of whom commanded ships in the spanish navy engaged
with each other before the port of cadiz each supposing that he
was attacking an enemy a fierce battle was kept up during a whole
night and both the vessels were sunk almost simultaneously a very
small part of the crew was saved and the two brothers had the
misfortune to recognize each other a little before they expired

the governor of cumana expressed his great satisfaction at the
resolution we had taken to remain for some time in new andalusia a
province which at that period was but little known even by name in
europe and which in its mountains and on the banks of its
numerous rivers contains a great number of objects worthy of
fixing the attention of naturalists senor emperan showed us
cottons dyed with native plants and fine furniture made
exclusively of the wood of the country he was much interested in
everything that related to natural philosophy and asked to our
great astonishment whether we thought that under the beautiful
sky of the tropics the atmosphere contained less azote (azotico)
than in spain or whether the rapidity with which iron oxidates in
those climates were only the effect of greater humidity as
indicated by the air hygrometer the name of his native country
pronounced on a distant shore would not have been more agreeable to
the ear of a traveller than those words azote oxide of iron and
hygrometer were to ours senor emparan was a lover of science and
the public marks of consideration which he gave us during a long
abode in his government contributed greatly to procure us a
favourable welcome in every part of south america

we hired a spacious house the situation of which was favourable
for astronomical observations we enjoyed an agreeable coolness
when the breeze arose the windows were without glass and even
without those paper panes which are often substituted for glass at
cumana the whole of the passengers of the pizarro left the vessel
but the recovery of those who had been attacked by the fever was
very slow we saw some who a month after notwithstanding the care
bestowed on them by their countrymen were still extremely weak and
reduced hospitality in the spanish colonies is such that a
european who arrives without recommendation or pecuniary means is
almost sure of finding assistance if he land in any port on
account of sickness the catalonians the galicians and the
biscayans have the most frequent intercourse with america they
there form as it were three distinct corporations which exercise a
remarkable influence over the morals the industry and commerce of
the colonies the poorest inhabitant of siges or vigo is sure of
being received into the house of a catalonian or galician pulpero*
(* a retail dealer) whether he land in chile or the philippine
islands

among the sick who landed at cumana was a negro who fell into a
state of insanity a few days after our arrival he died in that
deplorable condition though his master almost seventy years old
who had left europe to settle at san blas at the entrance of the
gulf of california had attended him with the greatest care i
relate this fact as affording evidence that men born under the
torrid zone after having dwelt in temperate climates sometimes
feel the pernicious effects of the heat of the tropics the negro
was a young man eighteen years of age very robust and born on
the coast of guinea an abode of some years on the high plain of
castile had imparted to his organization that kind of irritability
which renders the miasma of the torrid zone so dangerous to the
inhabitants of the countries of the north

the site on which cumana is built is part of a tract of ground
very remarkable in a geological point of view the chain of the
calcareous alps of the brigantine and the tataraqual stretches east
and west from the summit of the imposible to the port of mochima
and to campanario the sea in times far remote appears to have
divided this chain from the rocky coasts of araya and maniquarez
the vast gulf of cariaco has been caused by an irruption of the
sea and no doubt can be entertained but that the waters once
covered on the southern bank the whole tract of land impregnated
with muriate of soda through which flows the manzanares the slow
retreat of the waters has turned into dry ground this extensive
plain in which rises a group of small hills composed of gypsum
and calcareous breccias of very recent formation the city of
cumana is backed by this group which was formerly an island of the
gulf of cariaco that part of the plain which is north of the city
is called plaga chica or the little plain and extends eastwards
as far as punta delgada where a narrow valley covered with yellow
gomphrena still marks the point of the ancient outlet of the
waters

the hill of calcareous breccias which we have just mentioned as
having once been an island in the ancient gulf is covered with a
thick forest of cylindric cactus and opuntia some of these trees
thirty or forty feet high are covered with lichens and are
divided into several branches in the form of candelabra near
maniquarez at punta araya we measured a cactus* the trunk of
which was four feet nine inches in circumference (* tuna macho we
distinguish in the wood of the cactus the medullary prolongations
as m desfontaines has already observed) a european acquainted
only with the opuntia in our hot-houses is surprised to see the
wood of this plant become so hard from age that it resists for
centuries both air and moisture the indians of cumana therefore
employ it in preference to any other for oars and door-posts
cumana coro the island of margareta and curassao are the parts
of south america that abound most in plants of the nopal family
there only a botanist after a long residence could compose a
monography of the genus cactus the species of which vary not only
in their flowers and fruits but also in the form of their
articulated stems the number of costae and the disposition of the
thorns we shall see hereafter how these plants which characterize
a warm and singularly dry climate like that of egypt and
california gradually disappear in proportion as we remove from the
coasts and penetrate into the inland country

the groups of columnar cactus and opuntia produce the same effect
in the arid lands of equinoctial america as the junceae and the
hydrocharides in the marshes of our northern climes places in
which the larger species of the strong cactus are collected in
groups are considered as almost impenetrable these places are
called tunales and they are impervious not only to the native who
goes naked to the waist but are formidable even to those who are
fully clothed in our solitary rambles we sometimes endeavoured to
penetrate into the tunal that crowns the summit of the castle hill
a part of which is crossed by a pathway where we could have
studied amidst thousands of specimens the organization of this
singular plant sometimes night suddenly overtook us for there is
scarcely any twilight in this climate and we then found ourselves
dangerously situated as the cascabel or rattle-snake the coral
and other vipers armed with poisonous fangs frequent these
scorched and arid haunts to deposit their eggs in the sand

the castle of san antonio is built at the western extremity of the
hill but not on the most elevated point being commanded on the
east by an unfortified summit the tunal is considered both here
and everywhere in the spanish colonies as a very important means of
military defence and when earthen works are raised the engineers
are eager to propagate the thorny opuntia and promote its growth
as they are careful to keep crocodiles in the ditches of fortified
places in regions where organized nature is so powerful and
active man summons as auxiliaries in his defence the carnivorous
reptile and the plant with its formidable armour of thorns

the castle is only thirty toises above the level of the water in
the gulf of cariaco standing on a naked and calcareous hill it
commands the town and has a very picturesque effect when viewed
from a vessel entering the port it forms a bright object against
the dark curtains of those mountains which raise their summits to
the clouds and of which the vaporous and bluish tint blends with
the azure sky on descending from fort san antonio to the
south-west we find on the slope of the same rock the ruins of the
old castle of santa maria this site is delightful to those who
wish to enjoy at the approach of sunset the freshness of the breeze
and the view of the gulf the lofty summits of the island of
margareta are seen above the rocky coast of the isthmus of araya
and towards the west the small islands of caracas picuita and
boracha recall to mind the catastrophes that have overwhelmed the
coasts of terra firma these islets resemble fortifications and
from the effect of the mirage (while the inferior strata of the
air the ocean and the soil are unequally heated by the sun)
their points appear raised like the extremity of the great
promontories of the coast it is pleasing during the day to
observe these inconstant phenomena we see as night approaches
these stony masses which had been suspended in the air settle down
on their bases and the luminary whose presence vivifies organic
nature seems by the variable inflection of its rays to impress
motion on the stable rock and give an undulating movement to
plains covered with arid sands* (* the real cause of the mirage
or the extraordinary refraction which the rays undergo when strata
of air of different densities lie over each other was guessed at
by hooke see his posthumous works page 472)

the town of cumana properly so called occupies the ground lying
between the castle of san antonio and the small rivers of
manzanares and santa catalina the delta formed by the bifurcation
of the first of these rivers is a fertile plain covered with
mammees sapotas (achras) plantains and other plants cultivated
in the gardens or charas of the indians the town has no remarkable
edifice and the frequency of earthquakes forbids such
embellishments it is true that strong shocks occur less
frequently in a given time at cumana than at quito where we
nevertheless find sumptuous and very lofty churches but the
earthquakes of quito are violent only in appearance and from the
peculiar nature of the motion and of the ground no edifice there
is overthrown at cumana as well as at lima and in several cities
situated far from the mouths of burning volcanoes it happens that
the series of slight shocks is interrupted after a long course of
years by great catastrophes resembling the effects of the
explosion of a mine we shall have occasion to return to this
phenomenon for the explanation of which so many vain theories have
been imagined and which have been classified according to
perpendicular and horizontal movements shock and oscillation* (*
this classification dates from the time of posidonius it is the
successio and inclinatio of seneca but the ancients had already
judiciously remarked that the nature of these shocks is too
variable to permit any subjection to these imaginary laws)

the suburbs of cumana are almost as populous as the ancient town
they are three in number serritos on the road to the plaga
chicha where we meet with some fine tamarind trees st francis
towards the south-east and the great suburb of the guayquerias or
guayguerias the name of this tribe of indians was quite unknown
before the conquest the natives who bear that name formerly
belonged to the nation of the guaraounos of which we find remains
only in the swampy lands of the branches of the orinoco old men
have assured me that the language of their ancestors was a dialect
of the guaraouno but that for a century past no native of that
tribe at cumana or in the island of margareta has spoken any
other language than castilian

the denomination guayqueria like the words peru and peruvian owes
its origin to a mere mistake the companions of christopher
columbus coasting along the island of margareta the northern
coast of which is still inhabited by the noblest portion of the
guayqueria nation* (* the guayquerias of la banda del norte
consider themselves as the most noble race because they think they
are less mixed with the chayma indian and other copper-coloured
races they are distinguished from the guayquerias of the continent
by their manner of pronouncing the spanish language which they
speak almost without separating their teeth they show with pride
to europeans the punta de la galera or galley's point (so called
on account of the vessel of columbus having anchored there) and
the port of manzanillo where they first swore to the whites in
1498 that friendship which they have never betrayed and which has
obtained for them in court phraseology the title of fieles
loyal see above) encountered a few natives who were harpooning
fish by throwing a pole tied to a cord and terminating in an
extremely sharp point they asked them in the haiti language their
name and the indians thinking that the question of the strangers
related to their harpoons which were formed of the hard and heavy
wood of the macana palm answered guaike guaike which signifies
pointed pole a striking difference at present exists between the
guayquerias a civilized tribe of skilled fishermen and those
savage guaraounos of the orinoco who suspend their habitations on
the trunks of the moriche palm the population of cumana has been
singularly exaggerated but according to the most authentic
registers it does not exceed 16000 souls

probably the indian suburb will by degrees extend as far as the
embarcadero the plain which is not yet covered with houses or
huts being more than 340 toises in length the heat is somewhat
less oppressive on the side near the seashore than in the old
town where the reverberation of the calcareous soil and the
proximity of the mountain of san antonio raise the temperature to
an excessive degree in the suburb of the guayquerias the sea
breezes have free access the soil is clayey and for that reason
it is thought to be less exposed to violent shocks of earthquake
than the houses at the foot of the rocks and hills on the right
bank of the manzanares

the shore near the mouth of the small river santa catalina is
bordered with mangrove trees* but these mangroves are not
sufficiently spread to diminish the salubrity of the air of cumana
(* rhizophora mangle m bonpland found on the plaga chica the
allionia incarnata in the same place where the unfortunate
loefling had discovered this new genus of nyctagineae) the soil of
the plain is in part destitute of vegetation in part covered with
tufts of sesuvium portulacastrum gomphrena flava g myrtifolia
talinum cuspidatum t cumanense and portulaca lanuginosa among
these herbaceous plants we find at intervals the avicennia
tomentosa the scoparia dulcis a frutescent mimosa with very
irritable leaves* and particularly cassias the number of which is
so great in south america that we collected in our travels more
than thirty new species (* the spaniards designate by the name of
dormideras (sleeping plants) the small number of mimosas with
irritable leaves we have increased this number by three species
previously unknown to botanists namely the mimosa humilis of
cumana the m pellita of the savannahs of calabozo and the m
dormiens of the banks of the apure)

on leaving the indian suburb and ascending the river southward we
found a grove of cactus a delightful spot shaded by tamarinds
brazilettos bombax and other plants remarkable for their leaves
and flowers the soil here is rich in pasturage and dairy-houses
built with reeds are separated from each other by clumps of trees
the milk remains fresh when kept not in the calabashes* of very
thick ligneous fibres (* these calabashes are made from the fruit
of the crescentia cujete) but in porous earthen vessels from
maniquarez a prejudice prevalent in northern countries had long
led me to believe that cows under the torrid zone did not yield
rich milk but my abode at cumana and especially an excursion
through the vast plains of calabozo covered with grasses and
herbaceous sensitive plants convinced me that the ruminating
animals of europe become perfectly habituated to the hottest
climates provided they find water and good nourishment milk is
excellent in the provinces of new andalusia barcelona and
venezuela and butter is better in the plains of the equinoctial
zone than on the ridge of the andes where the alpine plants
enjoying in no season a sufficiently high temperature are less
aromatic than on the pyrenees on the mountains of estremadura or
of greece as the inhabitants of cumana prefer the coolness of the
sea breeze to the sight of vegetation their favourite walk is the
open shore the spaniards who in general have no great
predilection for trees or for the warbling of birds have
transported their tastes and their habits into the colonies in
terra firma mexico and peru it is rare to see a native plant a
tree merely with the view of procuring shade and if we except the
environs of the great capitals walks bordered with trees are
almost unknown in those countries the arid plain of cumana
exhibits after violent showers an extraordinary phenomenon the
earth when drenched with rain and heated again by the rays of the
sun emits that musky odour which in the torrid zone is common to
animals of very different classes namely to the jaguar the small
species of tiger cat the cabiai or thick-nosed tapir* (* cavia
capybara linn chiguire) the galinazo vulture* (* vultur aura
linn zamuro or galinazo the brazilian vulture of buffon i
cannot reconcile myself to the adoption of names which designate
as belonging to a single country animals common to a whole
continent) the crocodile the viper and the rattlesnake the
gaseous emanations which are the vehicles of this aroma seem to
be evolved in proportion only as the mould containing the spoils
of an innumerable quantity of reptiles worms and insects begins
to be impregnated with water i have seen indian children of the
tribe of the chaymas draw out from the earth and eat millipedes or
scolopendras* eighteen inches long and seven lines broad (*
scolopendras are very common behind the castle of san antonio on
the summit of the hill) whenever the soil is turned up we are
struck with the mass of organic substances which by turns are
developed transformed and decomposed nature in these climates
appears more active more fruitful we may even say more prodigal
of life

on this shore and near the dairies just mentioned we enjoy
especially at sunrise a very beautiful prospect over an elevated
group of calcareous mountains as this group subtends an angle of
three degrees only at the house where we dwelt it long served me
to compare the variations of the terrestrial refraction with the
meteorological phenomena storms are formed in the centre of this
cordillera and we see from afar thick clouds resolve into abundant
rains while during seven or eight months not a drop of water falls
at cumana the brigantine which is the highest part of this chain
raises itself in a very picturesque manner behind brito and
tataraqual it takes its name from the form of a very deep valley
on the northern declivity which resembles the interior of a ship
the summit of this mountain is almost bare of vegetation and is
flat like that of mowna roa in the sandwich islands it is a
perpendicular wall or to use a more expressive term of the
spanish navigators a table (mesa) this peculiar form and the
symmetrical arrangement of a few cones which surround the
brigantine made me at first think that this group which is wholly
calcareous contained rocks of basaltic or trappean formation

the governor of cumana sent in 1797 a band of determined men to
explore this entirely desert country and to open a direct road to
new barcelona by the summit of the mesa it was reasonably
expected that this way would be shorter and less dangerous to the
health of travellers than the route taken by the couriers along
the coasts but every attempt to cross the chain of the mountains
of the brigantine was fruitless in this part of america as in
australia* to the west of sydney it is not so much the height of
the mountain chains as the form of the rocks that presents
obstacles difficult to surmount (* the blue mountains of
australia and those of carmarthen and lansdowne are not visible
in clear weather beyond fifty miles peron voyage aux terres
australes page 389 supposing the angle of altitude half a degree
the absolute height of these mountains would be about 620 toises)

the longitudinal valley formed by the lofty mountains of the
interior and the southern declivity of the cerro de san antonio is
intersected by the rio manzanares this plain the only thoroughly
wooded part in the environs of cumana is called the plain of the
charas* on account of the numerous plantations which the
inhabitants have begun for some years past along the river (*
chacra by corruption chara signifies a hut or cottage surrounded
by a garden the word ipure has the same signification) a narrow
path leads from the hill of san francisco across the forest to the
hospital of the capuchins a very agreeable country-house which
the aragonese monks have built as a retreat for old infirm
missionaries who can no longer fulfil the duties of their
ministry as we advance to the west the trees of the forest become
more vigorous and we meet with a few monkeys* (* the common
machi or weeping monkey) which however are very rare in the
environs of cumana at the foot of the capparis the bauhinia and
the zygophyllum with flowers of a golden yellow there extends a
carpet of bromelia* (* chihuchihue of the family of the ananas)
akin to the b karatas which from the odour and coolness of its
foliage attracts the rattlesnake

the waters of the manzanares are very limpid in quality and this
river has no resemblance to the manzanares of madrid which appears
the more magnificent in contrast with the fine bridge by which it
is crossed it takes its source like all the rivers of new
andalusia in the savannahs (llanos) known by the names of the
plateaux of jonoro amana and guanipa* (* these three eminences
bear the names of mesas tables an immense plain has an almost
imperceptible rise from both sides to the middle without any
appearance of mountains or hills) and it receives near the indian
village of san fernando the waters of the rio juanillo it has
been several times proposed to the government but without success
to construct a dyke at the first ipure in order to form artificial
irrigations in the plain of charas for notwithstanding its
apparent sterility the soil is extremely productive wherever
humidity is combined with the heat of the climate the cultivators
were gradually to refund the money advanced for the construction of
the sluices meanwhile pumps worked by mules and other hydraulic
but imperfect machines have been erected to serve till this
project is carried into execution

the banks of the manzanares are very pleasant and are shaded by
mimosas erythrinas ceibas and other trees of gigantic growth a
river the temperature of which in the season of the floods
descends as low as twenty-two degrees when the air is at thirty
and thirty-three degrees is an inestimable benefit in a country
where the heat is excessive during the whole year and where it is
so agreeable to bathe several times in the day the children pass a
considerable part of their lives in the water all the inhabitants
even the women of the most opulent families know how to swim and
in a country where man is so near the state of nature one of the
first questions asked on meeting in the morning is whether the
water is cooler than it was on the preceding evening one of the
modes of bathing is curious we every evening visited a family in
the suburb of the guayquerias in a fine moonlight night chairs
were placed in the water the men and women were lightly clothed
as in some baths of the north of europe and the family and
strangers assembled in the river passed some hours in smoking
cigars and in talking according to the custom of the country of
the extreme dryness of the season of the abundant rains in the
neighbouring districts and particularly of the extravagancies of
which the ladies of cumana accuse those of caracas and the
havannah the company were under no apprehensions from the bavas
or small crocodiles which are now extremely scarce and which
approach men without attacking them these animals are three or
four feet long we never met with them in the manzanares but with
a great number of dolphins (toninas) which sometimes ascend the
river in the night and frighten the bathers by spouting water

the port of cumana is a roadstead capable of receiving the fleets
of europe the whole of the gulf of cariaco which is about 35
miles long and 48 broad affords excellent anchorage the pacific
is not more calm on the shores of peru than the caribbean sea from
porto-cabello and especially from cape codera to the point of
paria the hurricanes of the west indies are never felt in these
regions the only danger in the port of cumana is a shoal called
morro roxo there are from one to three fathoms water on this
shoal while just beyond its edges there are eighteen thirty and
even thirty-eight the remains of an old battery situated
north-north-east of the castle of san antonio and very near it
serve as a mark to avoid the bank of morro roxo

the city lies at the foot of a hill destitute of verdure and is
commanded by a castle no steeple or dome attracts from afar the
eye of the traveller but only a few trunks of tamarind cocoa and
date trees which rise above the houses the roofs of which are
flat the surrounding plains especially those on the coasts wear
a melancholy dusty and arid appearance while a fresh and
luxuriant vegetation marks from afar the windings of the river
which separates the city from the suburbs the population of
european and mixed race from the copper-coloured natives the hill
of fort san antonio solitary white and bare reflects a great
mass of light and of radiant heat it is composed of breccia the
strata of which contain numerous fossils in the distance towards
the south stretches a vast and gloomy curtain of mountains these
are the high calcareous alps of new andalusia surmounted by
sandstone and other more recent formations majestic forests cover
this cordillera of the interior and they are joined by a woody
vale to the open clayey lands and salt marshes of the environs of
cumana a few birds of considerable size contribute to give a
peculiar character to these countries on the seashore and in the
gulf we find flocks of fishing herons and alcatras of a very
unwieldy form which swim like the swan raising their wings
nearer the habitation of man thousands of galinazo vultures the
jackals of the winged tribe are ever busy in disinterring the
carcases of animals* (* buffon hist nat des oiseaux tome 1 page
114) a gulf containing hot and submarine springs divides the
secondary from the primary and schistose rocks of the peninsula of
araya each of these coasts is washed by a tranquil sea of azure
tint and always gently agitated by a breeze from one quarter a
bright clear sky with a few light clouds at sunset reposes on the
ocean on the treeless peninsula and on the plains of cumana
while we see the storms accumulate and descend in fertile showers
among the inland mountains thus on these coasts as well as at the
foot of the andes the earth and the sky present the extremes of
clear weather and fogs of drought and torrents of rain of
absolute nudity and never-ceasing verdure

the analogies which we have just indicated between the sea-coasts
of new andalusia and those of peru extend also to the recurrence
of earthquakes and the limits which nature seems to have
prescribed to these phenomena we have ourselves felt very violent
shocks at cumana and we learned on the spot the most minute
circumstances that accompanied the great catastrophe of the 14th
december 1797

it is a very generally received opinion on the coasts of cumana
and in the island of margareta that the gulf of cariaco owes its
existence to a rent of the continent attended by an irruption of
the sea the remembrance of that great event was preserved among
the indians to the end of the fifteenth century and it is related
that at the time of the third voyage of christopher columbus the
natives mentioned it as of very recent date in 1530 the
inhabitants were alarmed by new shocks on the coasts of paria and
cumana the land was inundated by the sea and the small fort
built by james castellon at new toledo* was entirely destroyed (*
this was the first name given to the city of cumana girolamo
benzoni hist del mondo nuovo pages 3 31 and 33 james castellon
arrived at st domingo in 1521 after the appearance of the
celebrated bartholomew de las casas in these countries on
attentively reading the narratives of benzoni and caulin we find
that the fort of castellon was built near the mouth of the
manzanares (alla ripa del fiume de cumana) and not as some modern
travellers have asserted on the mountain where now stands the
castle of san antonio) at the same time an enormous opening was
formed in the mountains of cariaco on the shores of the gulf
bearing that name when a great body of salt-water mixed with
asphaltum issued from the micaceous schist earthquakes were very
frequent about the end of the sixteenth century and according to
the traditions preserved at cumana the sea often inundated the
shores rising from fifteen to twenty fathoms

as no record exists at cumana and its archives owing to the
continual devastations of the termites or white ants contain no
document that goes back farther than a hundred and fifty years we
are unacquainted with the precise dates of the ancient earthquakes
we only know that in times nearer our own the year 1776 was at
once the most fatal to the colonists and the most remarkable for
the physical history of the country the city of cumana was
entirely destroyed the houses were overturned in the space of a
few minutes and the shocks were hourly repeated during fourteen
months in several parts of the province the earth opened and
threw out sulphureous waters these irruptions were very frequent
in a plain extending towards casanay two leagues east of the town
of cariaco and known by the name of the hollow ground (tierra
hueca) because it appears entirely undermined by thermal springs
during the years 1766 and 1767 the inhabitants of cumana encamped
in their streets and they began to rebuild their houses only when
the earthquakes recurred once a month what was felt at quito
immediately after the great catastrophe of february 1797 took
place on these coasts while the ground was in a state of continual
oscillation the atmosphere seemed to dissolve itself into water

tradition states that in the earthquake of 1766 as well as in
another remarkable one in 1794 the shocks were mere horizontal
oscillations it was only on the disastrous 14th of december 1797
that for the first time at cumana the motion was felt by an
upheaving of the ground more than four-fifths of the city were
then entirely destroyed and the shock attended by a very loud
subterraneous noise resembled as at riobamba the explosion of a
mine at a great depth happily the most violent shock was preceded
by a slight undulating motion so that most of the inhabitants were
enabled to escape into the streets and a small number only
perished of those who had assembled in the churches it is a
generally received opinion at cumana that the most destructive
earthquakes are announced by very feeble oscillations and by a
hollow sound which does not escape the observation of persons
habituated to this kind of phenomenon in those fatal moments the
cries of 'misericordia tembla tembla'* are everywhere heard (*
"mercy the earthquake the earthquake" see tschudi's travels in
peru page 170) and it rarely happens that a false alarm is given
by a native those who are most apprehensive attentively observe
the motions of dogs goats and swine the last-mentioned animals
endowed with delicate olfactory nerves and accustomed to turn up
the earth give warning of approaching danger by their restlessness
and their cries we shall not attempt to decide whether being
nearer the surface of the ground they are the first to hear the
subterraneous noise or whether their organs receive the impression
of some gaseous emanation which issues from the earth we cannot
deny the possibility of this latter cause during my abode at peru
a fact was observed in the inland country which has an analogy
with this kind of phenomenon and which is not unfrequent at the
end of violent earthquakes the herbs that cover the savannahs of
tucuman acquired noxious properties an epidemic disorder broke out
among the cattle and a great number of them appeared stupified or
suffocated by the deleterious vapours exhaled from the ground

at cumana half an hour before the catastrophe of the 14th of
december 1797 a strong smell of sulphur was perceived near the
hill of the convent of san francisco and on the same spot the
subterraneous noise which seemed to proceed from south-east to
north-west was loudest at the same time flames appeared on the
banks of the manzanares near the hospital of the capuchins and in
the gulf of cariaco near mariguitar this last phenomenon so
extraordinary in a country not volcanic is pretty frequent in the
alpine calcareous mountains near cumanacoa in the valley of
bordones in the island of margareta and amidst the llanos or
savannahs of new andalusia in these savannahs flakes of fire
rising to a considerable height are seen for hours together in the
dryest places and it is asserted that on examining the ground no
crevice is perceptible this fire which resembles the springs of
hydrogen or salse of modena or what is called the
will-o'-the-wisp of our marshes does not burn the grass because
no doubt the column of gas which develops itself is mixed with
azote and carbonic acid and does not burn at its basis the
people although less superstitious here than in spain call these
reddish flames by the singular name of 'the soul of the tyrant
aguirre' imagining that the spectre of lopez aguirre harassed by
remorse wanders over these countries sullied by his crimes* (*
when at cumana or in the island of margareta the people pronounce
the words el tirano (the tyrant) it is always to denote the hated
lopez d'aguirre who after having taken part in 1560 in the
revolt of fernando de guzman against pedro de ursua governor of
the omeguas and dorado voluntarily took the title of traidor or
traitor he descended the river amazon with his band and reached
by a communication of the rivers of guyana the island of margareta
the port of paraguache still bears in this island the name of the
tyrant's port)

the great earthquake of 1797 produced some changes in the
configuration of the shoal of morro roxo towards the mouth of the
rio bordones similar swellings were observed at the time of the
total destruction of cumana in 1766 at that period the punta
delgado on the southern coast of the gulf of cariaco became
perceptibly enlarged and in the rio guarapiche near the village
of maturin a shoal was formed no doubt by the action of the
elastic fluids which displaced and raised up the bed of the river

in order to follow a plan conformable to the end we proposed in
this work we shall endeavour to generalize our ideas and to
comprehend in one point of view everything that relates to these
phenomena so terrific and so difficult to explain if it be the
duty of the men of science who visit the alps of switzerland or
the coasts of lapland to extend our knowledge respecting the
glaciers and the aurora borealis it may be expected that a
traveller who has journeyed through spanish america should have
chiefly fixed his attention on volcanoes and earthquakes each part
of the globe is an object of particular study and when we cannot
hope to penetrate the causes of natural phenomena we ought at
least to endeavour to discover their laws and distinguish by the
comparison of numerous facts that which is permanent and uniform
from that which is variable and accidental

the great earthquakes which interrupt the long series of slight
shocks appear to have no regular periods at cumana they have
taken place at intervals of eighty a hundred and sometimes less
than thirty years while on the coasts of peru for instance at
lima a certain regularity has marked the periods of the total
destruction of the city the belief of the inhabitants in the
existence of this uniformity has a happy influence on public
tranquillity and the encouragement of industry it is generally
admitted that it requires a sufficiently long space of time for
the same causes to act with the same energy but this reasoning is
just only inasmuch as the shocks are considered as a local
phenomenon and a particular focus under each point of the globe
exposed to those great catastrophes is admitted whenever new
edifices are raised on the ruins of the old we hear from those who
refuse to build that the destruction of lisbon on the first day of
november 1755 was soon followed by a second and not less fatal
convulsion on the 31st of march 1761

it is a very ancient opinion* (* aristotle de meteor lib 2 (ed
duval tome 1 page 798) seneca nat quaest lib 6 c 12) and one
that is commonly received at cumana acapulco and lima that a
perceptible connection exists between earthquakes and the state of
the atmosphere that precedes those phenomena but from the great
number of earthquakes which i have witnessed to the north and south
of the equator on the continent and on the seas on the coasts
and at 2500 toises height it appears to me that the oscillations
are generally very independent of the previous state of the
atmosphere this opinion is entertained by a number of intelligent
residents of the spanish colonies whose experience extends if not
over a greater space of the globe at least over a greater number
of years than mine on the contrary in parts of europe where
earthquakes are rare compared to america scientific observers are
inclined to admit an intimate connection between the undulations of
the ground and certain meteors which appear simultaneously with
them in italy for instance the sirocco and earthquakes are
suspected to have some connection and in london the frequency of
falling-stars and those southern lights which have since been
often observed by mr dalton were considered as the forerunners of
those shocks which were felt from 1748 to 1756

on days when the earth is shaken by violent shocks the regularity
of the horary variations of the barometer is not disturbed within
the tropics i had opportunities of verifying this observation at
cumana at lima and at riobamba and it is the more worthy of
attention as at st domingo (in the town of cape francois) it is
asserted that a water-barometer sank two inches and a half
immediately before the earthquake of 1770 it is also related
that at the time of the destruction of oran a druggist fled with
his family because observing accidentally a few minutes before
the earthquake the height of the mercury in his barometer he
perceived that the column sank in an extraordinary manner i know
not whether we can give credit to this story but as it is nearly
impossible to examine the variations of the weight of the
atmosphere during the shocks we must be satisfied with observing
the barometer before or after these phenomena have taken place

we can scarcely doubt that the earth when opened and agitated by
shocks spreads occasionally gaseous emanations through the
atmosphere in places remote from the mouths of volcanoes not
extinct at cumana it has already been observed that flames and
vapours mixed with sulphurous acid spring up from the most arid
soil in other parts of the same province the earth ejects water
and petroleum at riobamba a muddy and inflammable mass called
moya issues from crevices that close again and accumulates into
elevated hills at about seven leagues from lisbon near colares
during the terrible earthquake of the 1st of november 1755 flames
and a column of thick smoke were seen to issue from the flanks of
the rocks of alvidras and according to some witnesses from the
bosom of the sea

elastic fluids thrown into the atmosphere may act locally on the
barometer not by their mass which is very small compared to the
mass of the atmosphere but because at the moment of great
explosions an ascending current is probably formed which
diminishes the pressure of the air i am inclined to think that in
the majority of earthquakes nothing escapes from the agitated
earth and that when gaseous emanations and vapours are observed
they oftener accompany or follow than precede the shocks this
circumstance would seem to explain the mysterious influence of
earthquakes in equinoctial america on the climate and on the
order of the dry and rainy seasons if the earth generally act on
the air only at the moment of the shocks we can conceive why a
sensible meteorological change so rarely precedes those great
revolutions of nature

the hypothesis according to which in the earthquakes of cumana
elastic fluids tend to escape from the surface of the soil seems
confirmed by the great noise which is heard during the shocks at
the borders of the wells in the plain of charas water and sand are
sometimes thrown out twenty feet high similar phenomena were
observed in ancient times by the inhabitants of those parts of
greece and asia minor abounding with caverns crevices and
subterraneous rivers nature in her uniform progress everywhere
suggests the same ideas of the causes of earthquakes and the means
by which man forgetting the measure of his strength pretends to
diminish the effect of the subterraneous explosions what a great
roman naturalist has said of the utility of wells and caverns* is
repeated in the new world by the most ignorant indians of quito
when they show travellers the guaicos or crevices of pichincha (*
"in puteis est remedium quale et crebri specus praebent conceptum
enim spiritum exhalant quod in certis notatur oppidis quae minus
quatiuntur crebris ad eluviem cuniculis cavata" pliny lib 2 c
82 (ed par 1723 t 1 page 112) even at present in the capital
of st domingo wells are considered as diminishing the violence of
the shocks i may observe on this occasion that the theory of
earthquakes given by seneca (nat quaest lib 6 c 4-31)
contains the germ of everything that has been said in our times on
the action of the elastic vapours confined in the interior of the
globe)

the subterranean noise so frequent during earthquakes is
generally not in the ratio of the force of the shocks at cumana it
constantly precedes them while at quito and recently at caracas
and in the west india islands a noise like the discharge of a
battery was heard a long time after the shocks had ceased a third
kind of phenomenon the most remarkable of the whole is the
rolling of those subterranean thunders which last several months
without being accompanied by the least oscillatory motion of the
ground* (* the subterranean thunders (bramidos y truenos
subterraneos) of guanaxuato the phenomenon of a noise without
shocks was observed by the ancients aristot meteor lib 2 (ed
duval page 802) pliny lib 2 c 80)

in every country subject to earthquakes the point at which
probably owing to a particular disposition of the stony strata the
effects are most sensibly felt is considered as the cause and the
focus of the shocks thus at cumana the hill of the castle of san
antonio and particularly the eminence on which stands the convent
of st francis are believed to contain an enormous quantity of
sulphur and other inflammable matter we forget that the rapidity
with which the undulations are propagated to great distances even
across the basin of the ocean proves that the centre of action is
very remote from the surface of the globe from this same cause no
doubt earthquakes are not confined to certain species of rocks as
some naturalists suppose but all are fitted to propagate the
movement keeping within the limits of my own experience i may here
cite the granites of lima and acapulco the gneiss of caracas the
mica-slate of the peninsula of araya the primitive thonschiefer of
tepecuacuilco in mexico the secondary limestones of the
apennines spain and new andalusia and finally the trappean
porphyries of the provinces of quito and popayan* (* i might add
to the list of secondary rocks the gypsum of the newest formation
for instance that of montmartre situated on a marine calcareous
rock which is posterior to the chalk see the memoires de
l'academie tome 1 page 341 on the earthquake felt at paris and its
environs in 1681) in these different places the ground is
frequently agitated by the most violent shocks but sometimes in
the same rock the superior strata form invincible obstacles to the
propagation of the motion thus in the mines of saxony we have
seen workmen hasten up alarmed by oscillations which were not felt
at the surface of the ground

if in regions the most remote from each other primitive
secondary and volcanic rocks share equally in the convulsive
movements of the globe we cannot but admit also that within a
space of little extent certain classes of rocks oppose themselves
to the propagation of the shocks at cumana for instance before
the great catastrophe of 1797 the earthquakes were felt only along
the southern and calcareous coast of the gulf of cariaco as far as
the town of that name while in the peninsula of araya and at the
village of maniquarez the ground did not share the same agitation
but since december 1797 new communications appear to have been
opened in the interior of the globe the peninsula of araya is now
not merely subject to the same agitations as the soil of cumana
but the promontory of mica-slate previously free from earthquakes
has become in its turn a central point of commotion the earth is
sometimes strongly shaken at the village of maniquarez when on the
coast of cumana the inhabitants enjoy the most perfect
tranquillity the gulf of cariaco nevertheless is only sixty or
eighty fathoms deep

it has been thought from observations made both on the continent
and in the islands that the western and southern coasts are most
exposed to shocks this observation is connected with opinions
which geologists have long formed respecting the position of the
high chains of mountains and the direction of their steepest
declivities but the existence of the cordillera of caracas and
the frequency of the oscillations on the eastern and northern coast
of terra firma in the gulf of paria at carupano at cariaco and
at cumana render the accuracy of that opinion doubtful

in new andalusia as well as in chile and peru the shocks follow
the course of the shore and extend but little inland this
circumstance as we shall soon find indicates an intimate
connection between the causes which produce earthquakes and
volcanic eruptions if the earth was most agitated on the coasts
because they are the lowest part of the land why should not the
oscillations be equally strong and frequent on those vast savannahs
or prairies* which are scarcely eight or ten toises above the
level of the ocean? (* the llanos of cumana of new barcelona of
calabozo of apure and of meta)

the earthquakes of cumana are connected with those of the west
india islands and it has even been suspected that they have some
connection with the volcanic phenomena of the cordilleras of the
andes on the 4th of february 1797 the soil of the province of
quito suffered such a destructive commotion that near 40000
natives perished at the same period the inhabitants of the eastern
antilles were alarmed by shocks which continued during eight
months when the volcano of guadaloupe threw out pumice-stones
ashes and gusts of sulphureous vapours the eruption of the 27th
of september during which very long-continued subterranean noises
were heard was followed on the 14th of december by the great
earthquake of cumana another volcano of the west india islands
that of st vincent affords an example of these extraordinary
connections this volcano had not emitted flames since 1718 when
they burst forth anew in 1812 the total ruin of the city of
caracas preceded this explosion thirty-five days and violent
oscillations of the ground were felt both in the islands and on the
coasts of terra firma

it has long been remarked that the effects of great earthquakes
extend much farther than the phenomena arising from burning
volcanoes in studying the physical revolutions of italy in
carefully examining the series of the eruptions of vesuvius and
etna we can scarcely recognise notwithstanding the proximity of
these mountains any traces of a simultaneous action it is on the
contrary beyond a doubt that at the period of the last and
preceding destruction of lisbon* the sea was violently agitated
even as far as the new world for instance at the island of
barbados more than twelve hundred leagues distant from the coasts
of portugal

(* destruction of lisbon the 1st of november 1755 and 31st of
march 1761 during the first of these earthquakes the sea
inundated in europe the coasts of sweden england and spain in
america the islands of antigua barbados and martinique at
barbados where the ordinary tides rise only from twenty-four to
twenty-eight inches the water rose twenty feet in carlisle bay it
became at the same time as black as ink being without doubt
mixed with the petroleum or asphaltum which abounds at the bottom
of the sea as well on the coasts of the gulf of cariaco as near
the island of trinidad in the west indies and in several lakes of
switzerland this extraordinary motion of the waters was observed
six hours after the first shock that was felt at
lisbon philosophical transactions volume 49 pages 403 410 544

feet high was seen eight miles distant at sea this mass threw
itself impetuously on the coasts and beat down a great number of
houses like the wave eighty-four feet high which on the 9th of
june 1586 at the time of the great earthquake of lima covered
the port of callao acosta hist natural de las indias edition de
1591 page 123 in north america on lake ontario violent
agitations of the water were observed from the month of october
1755 these phenomena are proofs of subterraneous communications at
enormous distances on comparing the periods of the great
catastrophes of lima and guatimala which generally succeed each
other at long intervals it has sometimes been thought that the
effect of an action slowly propagating along the cordilleras
sometimes from north to south at other times from south to north
may be perceived cosmo bueno descripcion del peru ed de lima

when the shocks are not simultaneous or do not follow each other
at short intervals great doubts may be entertained with respect to
the supposed communication of the movement)

several facts tend to prove that the causes which produce
earthquakes have a near connection with those which act in volcanic
eruptions the connection of these causes was known to the
ancients and it excited fresh attention at the period of the
discovery of america the discovery of the new world not only
offered new productions to the curiosity of man it also extended
the then existing stock of knowledge respecting physical geography
the varieties of the human species and the migrations of nations
it is impossible to read the narratives of early spanish
travellers especially that of the jesuit acosta without
perceiving the influence which the aspect of a great continent the
study of extraordinary appearances of nature and intercourse with
men of different races must have exercised on the progress of
knowledge in europe the germ of a great number of physical truths
is found in the works of the sixteenth century and that germ would
have fructified had it not been crushed by fanaticism and
superstition we learned at pasto that the column of black and
thick smoke which in 1797 issued for several months from the
volcano near that shore disappeared at the very hour when sixty
leagues to the south the towns of riobamba hambato and tacunga
were destroyed by an enormous shock in the interior of a burning
crater near those hillocks formed by ejections of scoriae and
ashes the motion of the ground is felt several seconds before each
partial eruption takes place we observed this phenomenon at
vesuvius in 1805 while the mountain threw out incandescent
scoriae we were witnesses of it in 1802 on the brink of the
immense crater of pichincha from which nevertheless at that
time clouds of sulphureous acid vapours only issued

everything in earthquakes seems to indicate the action of elastic
fluids seeking an outlet to diffuse themselves in the atmosphere
often on the coasts of the pacific the action is almost
instantaneously communicated from chile to the gulf of guayaquil a
distance of six hundred leagues and what is very remarkable the
shocks appear to be the stronger in proportion as the country is
distant from burning volcanoes the granitic mountains of calabria
covered with very recent breccias the calcareous chain of the
apennines the country of pignerol the coasts of portugal and
greece those of peru and terra firma afford striking proofs of
this fact the globe it may be said is agitated with the greater
force in proportion as the surface has a smaller number of funnels
communicating with the caverns of the interior at naples and at
messina at the foot of cotopaxi and of tunguragua earthquakes are
dreaded only when vapours and flames do not issue from the craters
in the kingdom of quito the great catastrophe of riobamba led
several well-informed persons to think that that country would be
less frequently disturbed if the subterranean fire should break
the porphyritic dome of chimborazo and if that colossal mountain
should become a burning volcano at all times analogous facts have
led to the same hypotheses the greeks who like ourselves
attributed the oscillations of the ground to the tension of elastic
fluids cited in favour of their opinion the total cessation of
the shocks at the island of euboea by the opening of a crevice in
the lelantine plain* (* "the shocks ceased only when a crevice
which ejected a river of fiery mud opened in the plain of
lelantum near chalcis" strabo)

the phenomena of volcanoes and those of earthquakes have been
considered of late as the effects of voltaic electricity developed
by a particular disposition of heterogeneous strata it cannot be
denied that often when violent shocks succeed each other within
the space of a few hours the electricity of the air sensibly
increases at the instant the ground is most agitated but to
explain this phenomenon it is unnecessary to recur to an
hypothesis which is in direct contradiction to everything hitherto
observed respecting the structure of our planet and the
disposition of its strata

peninsula of araya

ruins of the castle of santiago

the first weeks of our abode at cumana were employed in testing our
instruments in herborizing in the neighbouring plains and in
examining the traces of the earthquake of the 14th of december
1797 overpowered at once by a great number of objects we were
somewhat embarrassed how to lay down a regular plan of study and
observation whilst every surrounding object was fitted to inspire
in us the most lively interest our physical and astronomical
instruments in their turns excited strongly the curiosity of the
inhabitants we had numerous visitors and in our desire to satisfy
persons who appeared so happy to see the spots of the moon through
dollond's telescope the absorption of two gases in a eudiometrical
tube or the effects of galvanism on the motions of a frog we were
obliged to answer questions often obscure and to repeat for whole
hours the same experiments these scenes were renewed for the space
of five years whenever we took up our abode in a place where it
was understood that we were in possession of microscopes
telescopes and electrical apparatus

i could not begin a regular course of astronomical observations
before the 28th of july though it was highly important for me to
know the longitude given by berthoud's time-keeper but it
happened that in a country where the sky is constantly clear and
serene no stars appeared for several nights the whole series of
the observations i made in 1799 and 1800 give for their results
that the latitude of the great square at cumana is 10 degrees 27
minutes 52 seconds and its longitude 66 degrees 30 minutes 2
seconds this longitude is founded on the difference of time on
lunar distances on the eclipse of the sun (on the 28th of october
1799) and on ten immersions of jupiter's satellites compared with
observations made in europe the oldest chart we have of the
continent that of don diego ribeiro geographer to the emperor
charles the fifth places cumana in latitude 9 degrees 30 minutes
which differs fifty-eight minutes from the real latitude and half
a degree from that marked by jefferies in his american pilot
published in 1794 during three centuries the whole of the coast
of terra firma has been laid down too far to the south this has
been owing to the current near the island of trinidad which sets
toward the north and mariners are led by their dead-reckoning to
think themselves farther south than they really are

on the 17th of august a halo round the moon fixed the attention of
the inhabitants of cumana who considered it as the presage of some
violent earthquake for according to popular notions all
extraordinary phenomena are immediately connected with each other
coloured circles around the moon are much more rare in northern
countries than in provence italy and spain they are seen
particularly (and this fact is singular enough) when the sky is
clear and the weather seems to be most fair and settled under the
torrid zone beautiful prismatic colours appear almost every night
and even at the time of the greatest droughts often in the space
of a few minutes they disappear several times because doubtless
the superior currents change the state of the floating vapours by
which the light is refracted i sometimes even observed between
the fifteenth degree of latitude and the equator small halos
around the planet venus the purple orange and violet were
distinctly perceived but i never saw any colours around sirius
canopus or acherner

while the halo was visible at cumana the hygrometer denoted great
humidity nevertheless the vapours appeared so perfectly in
solution or rather so elastic and uniformly disseminated that
they did not alter the transparency of the atmosphere the moon
arose after a storm of rain behind the castle of san antonio as
soon as she appeared on the horizon we distinguished two circles
one large and whitish forty-four degrees in diameter the other a
small circle of 1 degree 43 minutes displaying all the colours of
the rainbow the space between the two circles was of the deepest
azure at four degrees height they disappeared while the
meteorological instruments indicated not the slightest change in
the lower regions of the air this phenomenon had nothing
extraordinary except the great brilliancy of the colours added to
the circumstance that according to the measures taken with
ramsden's sextant the lunar disk was not exactly in the centre of
the haloes without this actual measurement we might have thought
that the excentricity was the effect of the projection of the
circles on the apparent concavity of the sky

if the situation of our house at cumana was highly favourable for
the observation of the stars and meteorological phenomena it
obliged us to be sometimes the witnesses of painful scenes during
the day a part of the great square is surrounded with arcades
above which is one of those long wooden galleries common in warm
countries this was the place where slaves brought from the coast
of africa were sold of all the european governments denmark was
the first and for a long time the only power which abolished the
traffic yet notwithstanding that fact the first negroes we saw
exposed for sale had been landed from a danish slave-ship what are
the duties of humanity national honour or the laws of their
country to men stimulated by the speculations of sordid interest?

the slaves exposed to sale were young men from fifteen to twenty
years of age every morning cocoa-nut oil was distributed among
them with which they rubbed their bodies to give their skin a
black polish the persons who came to purchase examined the teeth
of these slaves to judge of their age and health forcing open
their mouths as we do those of horses in a market this odious
custom dates from africa as is proved by the faithful pictures
drawn by the inimitable cervantes* who after his long captivity
among the moors described the sale of christian slaves at algiers
(* el trato de argel jorn 2 viage al parnasso 1784 page 316) it
is distressing to think that even at this day there exist european
colonists in the west indies who mark their slaves with a hot iron
to know them again if they escape this is the treatment bestowed
on those "who save other men the labour of sowing tilling and
reaping"* (* la bruyere caracteres edition 1765 chapter 11 page
300 i will here cite a passage strongly characteristic of la
bruyere's benevolent feeling for his fellow-creatures "we find
(under the torrid zone) certain wild animals male and female
scattered through the country black livid and all over scorched
by the sun bent to the earth which they dig and turn up with
invincible perseverance they have something like articulate
utterance and when they stand up on their feet they exhibit a
human face and in fact these creatures are men")

in 1800 the number of slaves did not exceed six thousand in the two
provinces of cumana and barcelona when at the same period the
whole population was estimated at one hundred and ten thousand
inhabitants the trade in african slaves which the laws of the
spaniards have never favoured is almost as nothing on these coasts
where the trade in american slaves was carried on in the sixteenth
century with desolating activity macarapan anciently called
amaracapana cumana araya and particularly new cadiz built on
the islet of cubagua might then be considered as commercial
establishments for facilitating the slave trade girolamo benzoni
of milan who at the age of twenty-two visited terra firma took
part in some expeditions in 1542 to the coasts of bordones
cariaco and paria to carry off the unfortunate natives he
relates with simplicity and often with a sensibility not common in
the historians of that time the examples of cruelty of which he
was a witness he saw the slaves dragged to new cadiz to be marked
on the forehead and on the arms and for the payment of the quint
to the officers of the crown from this port the indians were sent
to the island of haiti or st domingo after having often changed
masters not by way of sale but because the soldiers played for
them at dice

the first excursion we made was to the peninsula of araya and
those countries formerly celebrated for the slave-trade and the
pearl-fishery we embarked on the rio manzanares near the indian
suburb on the 19th of august about two in the morning the
principal objects of this excursion were to see the ruins of the
castle of araya to examine the salt-works and to make a few
geological observations on the mountains forming the narrow
peninsula of maniquarez the night was delightfully cool swarms of
phosphorescent insects* glistened in the air (* elater noctilucus
) and over a soil covered with sesuvium and groves of mimosa
which bordered the river we know how common the glow-worm* (*
lampyris italica l noctiluca) is in italy and in all the south
of europe but the picturesque effect it produces cannot be
compared to those innumerable scattered and moving lights which
embellish the nights of the torrid zone and seem to repeat on the
earth along the vast extent of the savannahs the brilliancy of
the starry vault of heaven

when on descending the river we drew near plantations or charas
we saw bonfires kindled by the negroes a light and undulating
smoke rose to the tops of the palm-trees and imparted a reddish
hue to the disk of the moon it was on a sunday night and the
slaves were dancing to the music of the guitar the people of
africa of negro race are endowed with an inexhaustible store of
activity and gaiety after having ended the labours of the week
the slaves on festival days prefer to listless sleep the
recreations of music and dancing

the bark in which we passed the gulf of cariaco was very spacious
large skins of the jaguar or american tiger were spread for our
repose during the night though we had yet scarcely been two months
in the torrid zone we had already become so sensible to the
smallest variation of temperature that the cold prevented us from
sleeping while to our surprise we saw that the centigrade
thermometer was as high as 218 degrees this fact is familiar to
those who have lived long in the indies and is worthy the
attention of physiologists bouguer relates that when he reached
the summit of montagne pelee in the island of martinique he and
his companions shivered with cold though the heat was above 215
degrees in reading the interesting narrative of captain bligh
who in consequence of a mutiny on board the bounty was forced to
make a voyage of twelve hundred leagues in an open boat we find
that that navigator in the tenth and twelfth degrees of south
latitude suffered much more from cold than from hunger during our
abode at guayaquil in the month of january 1803 we observed that
the natives covered themselves and complained of the cold when
the thermometer sank to 238 degrees whilst they felt the heat
suffocating at 305 degrees six or seven degrees were sufficient
to cause the opposite sensations of cold and heat because on
these coasts of south america the ordinary temperature of the
atmosphere is twenty-eight degrees the humidity which modifies
the conducting power of the air for heat contributes greatly to
these impressions in the port of guayaquil as everywhere else in
the low regions of the torrid zone the weather grows cool only
after storms of rain and i have observed that when the thermometer
sinks to 238 degrees de luc's hygrometer keeps up to fifty and
fifty-two degrees it is on the contrary at thirty-seven degrees
in a temperature of 305 degrees at cumana during very heavy
showers people in the streets are heard exclaiming que hielo
estoy emparamado* though the thermometer exposed to the rain sinks
only to 215 degrees (* "what an icy cold i shiver as if i was on
the top of the mountains" the provincial word emparamarse can be
translated only by a very long periphrasis paramo in peruvian
puna is a denomination found on all the maps of spanish america
in the colonies it signifies neither a desert nor a heath but a
mountainous place covered with stunted trees exposed to the winds
and in which a damp cold perpetually reigns in the torrid zone
the paramos are generally from one thousand six hundred to two
thousand toises high snow often falls on them but it remains only
a few hours for we must not confound as geographers often do the
words paramo and puna with that of nevado in peruvian ritticapa a
mountain which enters into the limits of perpetual snow these
notions are highly interesting to geology and the geography of
plants because in countries where no height has been measured we
may form an exact idea of the lowest height to which the
cordilleras rise on looking into the map for the words paramo and
nevado as the paramos are almost continually enveloped in a cold
and thick fog the people say at santa fe and at mexico cae un
paramito when a thick small rain falls and the temperature of the
air sinks considerably from paramo has been made emparamarse
which signifies to be as cold as if we were on the ridge of the
andes) from these observations it follows that between the
tropics in plains where the temperature of the air is in the
day-time almost invariably above twenty-seven degrees warmer
clothing during the night is requisite whenever in a damp air the
thermometer sinks four or five degrees

we landed about eight in the morning at the point of araya near
the new salt-works a solitary house near a battery of three guns
the only defence of this coast since the destruction of the fort
of santiago is the abode of the inspector it is surprising that
these salt-works which formerly excited the jealousy of the
english dutch and other maritime powers have not created a
village or even a farm a few huts only of poor indian fishermen
are found at the extremity of the point of araya

this spot commands a view of the islet of cubagua the lofty hills
of margareta the ruins of the castle of santiago the cerro de la
vela and the calcareous chain of the brigantine which bounds the
horizon towards the south i availed myself of this view to take
the angles between these different points from a basis of four
hundred toises which i measured between the battery and the hill
called the pena as the cerro de la vela the brigantine and the
castle of san antonio at cumana are equally visible from the punta
arenas situated to the west of the village of maniquarez the same
objects were available for an approximate determination of the
respective positions of several points which are laid down in the
mineralogical chart of the peninsula of araya

the abundance of salt contained in the peninsula of araya was known
to alonzo nino when following the tracks of columbus ojeda and
amerigo vespucci he visited these countries in 1499 though of all
the people on the globe the natives of south america consume the
least salt because they scarcely eat anything but vegetables it
nevertheless appears that at an early period the guayquerias dug
into the clayey and muriatiferous soil of punta arenas even the
brine-pits now called new (la salina nueva) situated at the
extremity of cape araya were worked in very remote times the
spaniards who settled at first at cubagua and soon after on the
coasts of cumana worked from the beginning of the sixteenth
century the salt marshes which stretch away like a lagoon to the
north of cerro de la vela as at that period the peninsula of araya
had no settled population the dutch availed themselves of the
natural riches of a soil which appeared to be property common to
all nations in our days each colony has its own salt-works and
navigation is so much improved that the merchants of cadiz can
send at a small expense salt from spain and portugal to the
southern hemisphere a distance of 1900 leagues to cure meat at
monte video and buenos ayres these advantages were unknown at the
time of the conquest colonial industry had then made so little
progress that the salt of araya was carried at great expense to
the west india islands carthagena and portobello in 1605 the
court of madrid sent armed ships to punta araya with orders to
expel the dutch by force of arms the dutch however continued to
carry on a contraband trade in salt till in 1622 there was built
near the salt-works a fort which afterwards became celebrated
under the name of the castillo de santiago or the real fuerza de
araya the great salt-marshes are laid down on the oldest spanish
maps sometimes as a bay and at other times as a lagoon laet who
wrote his orbis novus in 1633 and who had some excellent notions
respecting these coasts expressly states that the lagoon was
separated from the sea by an isthmus above the level of high water
in 1726 an impetuous hurricane destroyed the salt-works of araya
and rendered the fort the construction of which had cost more than
a million of piastres useless this hurricane was a very rare
phenomenon in these regions where the sea is in general as calm as
the water in our large rivers the waves overflowed the land to a
great extent and by the effect of this eruption of the ocean the
salt lake was converted into a gulf several miles in length since
that period artificial reservoirs or pits (vasets) have been
formed to the north of the range of hills which separates the
castle from the north coast of the peninsula

the consumption of salt amounted in 1799 and 1800 in the two
provinces of cumana* and barcelona to nine or ten thousand
fanegas each sixteen arrobas or four hundredweight this
consumption is very considerable and gives if we deduct from the
total population fifty thousand indians who eat very little salt
sixty pounds for each person salt beef called tasajo is the most
important article of export from barcelona of nine or ten thousand
fanegas furnished by the two provinces conjointly three thousand
only are produced by the salt-works of araya the rest is extracted
from the sea-water at the morro of barcelona at pozuelos at
piritu and in the golfo triste in mexico the salt lake of penon
blanco alone furnishes yearly more than two hundred and fifty
thousand fanegas of unpurified salt (* at the period of my visit
to that country the government of cumana comprehended the two
provinces of new andalusia and new barcelona the words province
and govierno or government of cumana are consequently not
synonymous a catalonian juan de urpin who had been by turns a
canon a doctor of laws a counsellor in st domingo and a private
soldier in the castle of araya founded in 1636 the city of new
barcelona and attempted to give the name of new catalonia (nueva
cathaluna) to the province of which this newly constructed city
became the capital this attempt was fruitless and it is from the
capital that the whole province took its name since my departure
from america it has been raised to the rank of a govierno in new
andalusia the indian name of cumana has superseded the names nueva
toledo and nueva cordoba which we find on the maps of the
seventeenth century)

the province of caracas possesses fine salt-works at los roques
those which formerly existed at the small island of tortuga where
the soil is strongly impregnated with muriate of soda were
destroyed by order of the spanish government a canal was made by
which the sea has free access to the salt-marshes foreign nations
who have colonies in the west indies frequented this uninhabited
island and the court of madrid from views of suspicious policy
was apprehensive that the salt-works of tortuga would give rise to
settlements by means of which an illicit trade would be carried on
with terra firma

the royal administration of the salt-works of araya dates only from
the year 1792 before that period they were in the hands of indian
fishermen who manufactured salt at their pleasure and sold it
paying the government the moderate sum of three hundred piastres
the price of the fanega was then four reals* (* in this narrative
as well as in the political essay on new spain all the prices are
reckoned in piastres and silver reals (reales de plata) eight of
these reals are equivalent to a piastre or one hundred and five
sous french money (4 shillings 4 1/2 pence english) nouv esp
volume 2 pages 519 616 and 866) but the salt was extremely
impure grey mixed with earthy particles and surcharged with
muriate and sulphate of magnesia since the province of cumana has
become dependent on the intendancia of caracas the sale of salt is
under the control of the excise and the fanega which the
guayquerias sold at half a piastre costs a piastre and a half* (*
the fanega of salt is sold to those indians and fishermen who do
not pay the duties (derechos reales) at punta araya for six at
cumana for eight reals the prices to the other tribes are at
araya ten at cumana twelve reals) this augmentation of price is
slightly compensated by greater purity of the salt and by the
facility with which the fishermen and farmers can procure it in
abundance during the whole year the salt-works of araya yielded to
the treasury in 1799 a clear income of eight thousand piastres

considered as a branch of industry the salt produced here is not of
any great importance but the nature of the soil which contains the
salt-marshes is well worthy of attention in order to obtain a
clear idea of the geological connection existing between this
muriatiferous soil and the rocks of more ancient formation we
shall take a general view of the neighbouring mountains of cumana
and those of the peninsula of araya and the island of margareta

three great parallel chains extend from east to west the two most
northerly chains are primitive and contain the mica-slates of
macanao and the san juan valley of maniquarez and of
chuparipari these we shall distinguish by the names of cordillera
of the island of margareta and cordillera of araya the third
chain the most southerly of the whole the cordillera of the
brigantine and of the cocollar contains rocks only of secondary
formation and what is remarkable enough though analogous to the
geological constitution of the alps westward of st gothard the
primitive chain is much less elevated than that which was composed
of secondary rocks* (* in new andalusia the cordillera of the
cocollar nowhere contains primitive rocks if these rocks form the
nucleus of this chain and rise above the level of the neighbouring
plains which is scarcely probable we must suppose that they are
all covered with limestone and sandstone in the swiss alps on the
contrary the chain which is designated under the too vague
denomination of lateral and calcareous contains primitive rocks
which according to the observations of escher and leopold von
buch are often visible to the height of eight hundred or a
thousand toises) the sea has separated the two northern
cordilleras those of the island of margareta and the peninsula of
araya and the small islands of coche and of cubagua are remnants
of the land that was submerged farther to the south the vast gulf
cariaco stretches away like a longitudinal valley formed by the
irruption of the sea between the two small chains of araya and the
cocollar between the mica-slate and the alpine limestone we shall
soon see that the direction of the strata very regular in the
first of these rocks is not quite parallel with the general
direction of the gulf in the high alps of europe the great
longitudinal valley of the rhone also sometimes cuts at an oblique
angle the calcareous banks in which it has been excavated

the two parallel chains of araya and the cocollar were connected
to the east of the town of cariaco between the lakes of campoma
and putaquao by a kind of transverse dyke which bears the name of
cerro de meapire and which in distant times by resisting the
impulse of the waves has hindered the waters of the gulf of
cariaco from uniting with those of the gulf of paria thus in
switzerland the central chain that which passes by the col de
ferrex the simplon st gothard and the splugen is connected on
the north and the south with two lateral chains by the mountains
of furca and maloya it is interesting to recall to mind those
striking analogies exhibited in both continents by the external
structure of the globe

the primitive chain of araya ends abruptly in the meridian of the
village of maniquarez and the western slope of the peninsula as
well as the plains in the midst of which stands the castle of san
antonio is covered with very recent formations of sandstone and
clay mixed with gypsum near maniquarez breccia or sandstone with
calcareous cement which might easily be confounded with real
limestone lies immediately over the mica-slate while on the
opposite side near punta delgada this sandstone covers a compact
bluish grey limestone almost destitute of petrifactions and
traversed by small veins of calcareous spar this last rock is
analogous to the limestone of the high alps* (* alpenkalkstein)

the very recent sandstone formation of the peninsula of araya
contains first near punta arenas a stratified sandstone
composed of very fine grains united by a calcareous cement in
small quantity secondly at the cerro de la vela a schistose
sandstone* (* sandsteinschiefer) without mica and passing into
slate-clay* (* thonschiefer) which accompanies coal thirdly on
the western side between punta gorda and the ruins of the castle
of santiago breccia composed of petrified sea-shells united by a
calcareous cement in which are mingled grains of quartz fourthly
near the point of barigon whence the stone employed
for building at cumana is obtained banks of yellowish white shelly
limestone in which are found some scattered grains of
quartz fifthly at penas negras at the top of the cerro de la vela a
bluish grey compact limestone very tender almost without
petrifactions and covering the schistose sandstone however
extraordinary this mixture of sandstone and compact limestone* (*
dichter kalkstein) may appear we cannot doubt that these strata
belong to one and the same formation the very recent secondary
rocks everywhere present analogous phenomena the molasse of the
pays de vaud contains a fetid shelly limestone and the cerite
limestone of the banks of the seine is sometimes mixed with
sandstone

the strata of calcareous breccia are composed of an infinite number
of sea-shells from four to six inches in diameter and in part
well preserved we find they contain not ammonites but
ampullaires solens and terebratulae the greater part of these
shells are mixed the oysters and pectinites being sometimes
arranged in families the whole are easily detached and their
interior is filled with fossil madrepores and cellepores we have
now to speak of a fourth formation which probably rests* on the
calcareous sandstone of araya i mean the muriatiferous clay (* it
were to be wished that mineralogical travellers would examine more
particularly the cerro de la vela the limestone of the penas
negras rests on a slate-clay mixed with quartzose sand but there
is no proof of the muriatiferous clay of the salt-works being of
more ancient formation than this slate-clay or of its alternating
with banks of sandstone no well having been dug in these
countries we can have no information respecting the superposition
of the strata the banks of calcareous sandstone which are found
at the mouth of the salt lake and near the fishermen's huts on the
coast opposite cape macano appeared to me to lie beneath the
muriatiferous clay) this clay hardened impregnated with
petroleum and mixed with lamellar and lenticular gypsum is
analogous to the salzthon which in europe accompanies the sal-gem
of berchtesgaden and in south america that of zipaquira it is
generally of a smoke-grey colour earthy and friable but it
encloses more solid masses of a blackish brown of a schistose and
sometimes conchoidal fracture these fragments from six to eight
inches long have an angular form when they are very small they
give the clay a porphyroidal appearance we find disseminated in
it as we have already observed either in nests or in small veins
selenite and sometimes though seldom fibrous gypsum it is
remarkable enough that this stratum of clay as well as the banks
of pure sal-gem and the salzthon in europe scarcely ever contains
shells while the rocks adjacent exhibit them in great abundance

although the muriate of soda is not found visible to the eye in the
clay of araya we cannot doubt of its existence it shows itself in
large crystals if we sprinkle the mass with rain-water and expose
it to the sun the lagoon to the east of the castle of santiago
exhibits all the phenomena which have been observed in the salt
lakes of siberia described by lepechin gmelin and pallas this
lagoon receives however only the rain-waters which filter
through the banks of clay and unite at the lowest point of the
peninsula while the lagoon served as a salt-work to the spaniards
and the dutch it did not communicate with the sea at present this
communication has been interrupted anew by faggots placed at the
place where the waters of the ocean made an irruption in 1726
after great droughts crystallized and very pure muriate of soda
in masses of three or four cubic feet is still drawn from time to
time from the bottom of the lagoon the salt waters of the lake
exposed to the heat of the sun evaporate at their surface crusts
of salt formed in a saturated solution fall to the bottom and by
the attraction between crystals of a similar nature and form the
crystallized masses daily augment it is generally observed that
the water is brackish wherever lagoons are formed in clayey ground
it is true that for the new salt-work near the battery of araya
the seawater is received into pits as in the salt marshes of the
south of france but in the island of margareta near pampatar
salt is manufactured by employing only fresh water with which the
muriatiferous clay has first been lixiviated

we must not confound the salt disseminated in these clayey soils
with that contained in the sands of the seashore on the coasts of
normandy these phenomena considered in a geognostical point of
view have scarcely any properties in common i have seen
muriatiferous clay at the level of the ocean at punta araya and at
two thousand toises' height in the cordilleras of new grenada if
in the former of these places it lies on very recent shelly
breccia it forms on the contrary in austria near ischel a
considerable stratum in the alpine limestone which though equally
posterior to the existence of organic life on the globe is
nevertheless of high antiquity as is proved by the great number of
rocks with which it is covered we shall not question that
sal-gem either pure or mixed with muriatiferous clay may have
been deposited by an ancient sea but everything evinces that it
was formed during an order of things bearing no resemblance to that
in which the sea at present by a slower operation deposits a few
particles of muriate of soda on the sands of our shores in the
same manner as sulphur and coal belong to periods of formation very
remote from each other the sal-gem is also found sometimes in
transition gypsum* (* uebergangsgyps in the transition slate of
white alley (l'allee blanche) and between the grauwacke and black
transition limestone near bex below the dent de chamossaire
according to m von buch) sometimes in the alpine limestone* (*
at halle in the tyrol) sometimes in a muriatiferous clay lying on
a very recent sandstone* (* at punta araya) and lastly sometimes
in a gypsum* posterior to the chalk (* gypsum of the third
formation among the secondary gypsums the first formation contains
the gypsum in which are found the brine-springs of thuringia and
which is placed either in the alpine limestone or zechstein to
which it essentially belongs (freiesleben geognost arbeiten tome 2
page 131) or between the zechstein and the limestone of the jura
or between the zechstein and the new sandstone it is the ancient
gypsum of secondary formation of werner's school (alterer
flozgyps) which we almost preferably call muriatiferous gypsum
the second formation is composed of fibrous gypsum placed either
in the molasse or new sandstone or between this and the upper
limestone it abounds in common clay which differs essentially
from the salzthon or muriatiferous clay the third formation of
gypsum is more recent than chalk to this belongs the bony gypsum
of paris and as appears from the researches of mr steffens
(geogn aufsatsze 1810 page 142) the gypsum of segeberg in
holstein in which sal-gem is sometimes disseminated in very small
nests (jenaische litteratur-zeitung 1813 page 100) the gypsum of
paris lying between a cerite limestone which covers chalk and a
sandstone without shells is distinguished by fossil bones of
quadrupeds while the segeberg and lunebourg gypsums the position
of which is more uncertain are characterized by the boracits which
they contain two other formations far anterior to the three we
have just mentioned are the transition gypsum (ubergangsgyps) of
aigle and the primitive gypsum (urgyps) of the valley of canaria
near airolo i flatter myself that i may render some service to
those geologists who prefer the knowledge of positive facts to
speculation on the origin of things by furnishing them with
materials from which they may generalize their ideas on the
formation of rocks in both hemispheres the relative antiquity of
the formations is the principal object of a science which is to
render us acquainted with the structure of the globe that is to
say the nature of the strata which constitute the crust of our
planet)

the new salt-works of araya have five reservoirs or pits the
largest of which have two thousand three hundred square toises
surface their mean depth is eight inches use is made both of the
rain-water which by filtration collects at the lowest part of the
plain and of the water of the sea which enters by canals or
martellieres when the flood-tide is favoured by the winds the
situation of these new salt-works is less advantageous than that of
the lagoon the waters which fall into the latter pass over steeper
slopes washing a greater extent of ground

the earth already lixiviated is never carried away here as it is
from time to time in the island of margareta nor have wells been
dug in the muriatiferous clay with the view of finding strata
richer in muriate of soda the salineros or salt-workers generally
complain of want of rain and in the new salt-works it appears to
me difficult to determine what quantity of salt is derived solely
from the waters of the sea the natives estimate it at a sixth of
the total produce the evaporation is extremely strong and
favoured by the constant motion of the air so that the salt is
collected in eighteen or twenty days after the pits are filled

though the muriate of soda is manufactured with less care in the
peninsula of araya than at the salt-works of europe it is
nevertheless purer and contains less of earthy muriates and
sulphates we know not whether this purity may be attributed to
that portion of the salt which is furnished by the sea for though
it is extremely probable that the quantity of salt dissolved in
the waters of the ocean is nearly the same under every zone it is
not less uncertain whether the proportion between the muriate of
soda the muriate and sulphate of magnesia and the sulphate and
carbonate of lime be equally invariable

having examined the salt-works and terminated our geodesical
operations we departed at the decline of day to sleep at an indian
hut some miles distant near the ruins of the castle of araya
directing our course southward we traversed first the plain
covered with muriatiferous clay and stripped of vegetation then
two chains of hills of sandstone between which the lagoon is
situated night overtook us while we were in a narrow path
bordered on one side by the sea and on the other by a range of
perpendicular rocks the tide was rising rapidly and narrowed the
road at every step we at length arrived at the foot of the old
castle of araya where we enjoyed a prospect that had in it
something lugubrious and romantic the ruins stand on a bare and
arid mountain crowned with agave columnar cactus and thorny
mimosas they bear less resemblance to the works of man than to
those masses of rock which were ruptured at the early revolutions
of the globe

we were desirous of stopping to admire this majestic spectacle and
to observe the setting of venus whose disk appeared at intervals
between the yawning crannies of the castle but the muleteer who
served as our guide was parched with thirst and pressed us
earnestly to return he had long perceived that we had lost our
way and as he hoped to work on our fears he continually warned us
of the danger of tigers and rattlesnakes venomous reptiles are
indeed very common near the castle of araya and two jaguars had
been lately killed at the entrance of the village of maniquarez if
we might judge from their skins which were preserved their size
was not less than that of the indian tiger we vainly represented
to our guide that those animals did not attack men where the goats
furnished them with abundant prey we were obliged to yield and
return after having proceeded three quarters of an hour along a
shore covered by the tide we were joined by the negro who carried
our provision uneasy at not seeing us arrive he had come to meet
us and he led us through a wood of nopals to a hut inhabited by an
indian family we were received with the cordial hospitality
observed in this country among people of every tribe the hut in
which we slung our hammocks was very clean and there we found
fish plantains and what in the torrid zone is preferable to the
most sumptuous food excellent water

the next day at sunrise we found that the hut in which we had
passed the night formed part of a group of small dwellings on the
borders of the salt lake the remains of a considerable village
which had formerly stood near the castle the ruins of a church
were seen partly buried in the sand and covered with brushwood
when in 1762 to save the expense of the garrison the castle of
araya was totally dismantled the indians and mulattoes who were
settled in the neighbourhood emigrated by degrees to maniquarez to
cariaco and in the suburb of the guayquerias at cumana a small
number bound from affection to their native soil remained in this
wild and barren spot these poor people live by catching fish
which are extremely abundant on the coast and the neighbouring
shoals they appear satisfied with their condition and think it
strange when they are asked why they have no gardens or culinary
vegetables our gardens they reply are beyond the gulf when we
carry our fish to cumana we bring back plantains cocoa-nuts and
cassava this system of economy which favours idleness is
followed at maniquarez and throughout the whole peninsula of
araya the chief wealth of the inhabitants consists in goats which
are of a very large and very fine breed and rove in the fields
like those at the peak of teneriffe they have become entirely
wild and are marked like the mules because it would be difficult
to recognize them from their colour or the arrangement of their
spots these wild goats are of a brownish yellow and are not
varied in colour like domestic animals if in hunting a colonist
kills a goat which he does not consider as his own property he
carries it immediately to the neighbour to whom it belongs during
two days we heard it everywhere spoken of as a very extraordinary
circumstance that an inhabitant of maniquarez had lost a goat on
which it was probable that a neighbouring family had regaled
themselves

among the mulattoes whose huts surround the salt lake we found it
shoemaker of castilian descent he received us with the air of
gravity and self-sufficiency which in those countries characterize
almost all persons who are conscious of possessing some peculiar
talent he was employed in stretching the string of his bow and
sharpening his arrows to shoot birds his trade of a shoemaker
could not be very lucrative in a country where the greater part of
the inhabitants go barefooted and he only complained that on
account of the dearness of european gunpowder a man of his quality
was reduced to employ the same weapons as the indians he was the
sage of the plain he understood the formation of the salt by the
influence of the sun and full moon the symptoms of earthquakes
the marks by which mines of gold and silver are discovered and the
medicinal plants which like all the other colonists from chile to
california he classified into hot and cold* (* exciting or
debilitating the sthenic and asthenic of brown's system) having
collected the traditions of the country he gave us some curious
accounts of the pearls of cubagua objects of luxury which he
treated with the utmost contempt to show us how familiar to him
were the sacred writings he took a pride in reminding us that job
preferred wisdom to all the pearls of the indies his philosophy
was circumscribed to the narrow circle of the wants of life the
possession of a very strong ass able to carry a heavy load of
plantains to the embarcadero was the consummation of all his
wishes

after a long discourse on the emptiness of human greatness he drew
from a leathern pouch a few very small opaque pearls which he
forced us to accept enjoining us at the same time to note on our
tablets that a poor shoemaker of araya but a white man and of
noble castilian race had been enabled to give us something which
on the other side of the sea* was sought for as very precious (*
'por alla' or 'del otro lado del charco' (properly 'beyond' or
'on the other side of the great lake') a figurative expression by
which the people in the spanish colonies denote europe) i here
acquit myself of the promise i made to this worthy man who
disinterestedly refused to accept of the slightest retribution the
pearl coast presents the same aspect of misery as the countries of
gold and diamonds choco and brazil but misery is not there
attended with that immoderate desire of gain which is excited by
mineral wealth

the pearl-breeding oyster (avicula margaritifera cuvier) abounds
on the shoals which extend from cape paria to cape la vela the
islands of margareta cubagua coche punta araya and the mouth of
the rio la hacha were in the sixteenth century as celebrated as
were the persian gulf and the island of taprobana among the
ancients it is incorrectly alleged by some historians that the
natives of america were unacquainted with the luxury of pearls the
first spaniards who landed in terra firma found the savages decked
with pearl necklaces and bracelets and among the civilized people
of mexico and peru pearls of a beautiful form were extremely
sought after i have published a dissertation on the statue of a
mexican priestess in basalt whose head-dress resembling the
calantica of the heads of isis is ornamented with pearls las
casas and benzoni have described but not without some
exaggeration the cruelties which were exercised on the unhappy
indian slaves and negroes employed in the pearl fishery at the
beginning of the conquest the island of coche alone furnished
pearls amounting in value to fifteen hundred marks per month

the quint which the king's officers drew from the produce of
pearls amounted to fifteen thousand ducats which according to
the value of the precious metals in those times and the
extensiveness of contraband trade may be regarded as a very
considerable sum it appears that till 1530 the value of the pearls
sent to europe amounted yearly on an average to more than eight
hundred thousand piastres in order to judge of the importance of
this branch of commerce to seville toledo antwerp and genoa we
should recollect that at the same period the whole of the mines of
america did not furnish two millions of piastres and that the
fleet of ovando was thought to contain immense wealth because it
had on board nearly two thousand six hundred marks of silver
pearls were the more sought after as the luxury of asia had been
introduced into europe by two ways diametrically opposite that of
constantinople where the palaeologi wore garments covered with
strings of pearls and that of grenada the residence of the
moorish kings who displayed at their court all the luxury of the
east the pearls of the east were preferred to those of the west
but the number of the latter which circulated in commerce was
nevertheless considerable at the period immediately following the
discovery of america in italy as well as in spain the islet of
cubagua became the object of numerous mercantile speculations

benzoni* relates the adventure of one luigi lampagnano to whom
charles the fifth granted the privilege of proceeding with five
caravels to the coasts of cumana to fish for pearls (* la hist
del mondo nuovo page 34 luigi lampagnano a relation of the
assassin of the duke of milan galeazzo maria sforza could not pay
the merchants of seville who had advanced the money for his voyage
he remained five years at cubagua and died in a fit of insanity)
the colonists sent him back with this bold message "that the
emperor was too liberal of what was not his own and that he had no
right to dispose of the oysters which live at the bottom of the
sea"

the pearl fishery diminished rapidly about the end of the sixteenth
century and according to laet it had long ceased in 1633* (*
"insularum cubaguae et coches quondam magna fuit dignitas quum
unionum captura floreret nunc illa deficiente obscura admodum
fama" laet nova orbis page 669 this accurate compiler speaking
of punta araya adds this country is so forgotten "ut vix ulla
americae meridionalis pars hodie obscurior sit") the industry of
the venetians who imitated fine pearls with great exactness and
the frequent use of cut diamonds* rendered the fisheries of
cubagua less lucrative (* the cutting of diamonds was invented by
lewis de berquen in 1456 but the art became common only in the
following century) at the same time the oysters which yielded the
pearls became scarcer not because according to a popular
tradition they were frightened by the sound of the oars and
removed elsewhere but because their propagation had been impeded
by the imprudent destruction of the shells by thousands the
pearl-bearing oyster is of a more delicate nature than most of the
other acephalous mollusca at the island of ceylon where in the
bay of condeatchy the fishery employs six hundred divers and
where the annual produce is more than half a million of piastres
it has vainly been attempted to transplant the oysters to other
parts of the coast the government permits fishing there only
during a single month while at cubagua the bank of shells was
fished at all seasons to form an idea of the destruction of the
species caused by the divers we must remember that a boat
sometimes collects in two or three weeks more than thirty-five
thousand oysters the animal lives but nine or ten years and it is
only in its fourth year that the pearls begin to show themselves
in ten thousand shells there is often not a single pearl of value
tradition records that on the bank of margareta the fishermen
opened the shells one by one in the island of ceylon the animals
are thrown into heaps to rot in the air and to separate the pearls
which are not attached to the shell the animal pulp is washed as
miners wash the sand which contains grains of gold tin or
diamonds

at present spanish america furnishes no other pearls for trade than
those of the gulf of panama and the mouth of the rio de la hacha
on the shoals which surround cubagua coche and the island of
margareta the fishery is as much neglected as on the coasts of
california* (* i am astonished at never having heard in the
course of my travels of pearls found in the fresh-water shells of
south america though several species of the unio genus abound in
the rivers of peru) it is believed at cumana that the
pearl-oyster has greatly multiplied after two centuries of repose
and in 1812 some new attempts were made at margareta for the
fishing of pearls it has been asked why the pearls found at
present in shells which become entangled in the fishermen's nets
are so small and have so little brilliancy* whilst on the
spaniards' arrival they were extremely beautiful though the
indians doubtless had not taken the trouble of diving to collect
them (* the inhabitants of araya sometimes sell these small pearls
to the retail dealers of cumana the ordinary price is one piastre
per dozen) the problem is so much the more difficult to solve as
we know not whether earthquakes may have altered the nature of the
bottom of the sea or whether the changes of the submarine currents
may have had an influence either on the temperature of the water
or on the abundance of certain mollusca on which the aronde feeds

on the morning of the 20th our host's son a young and very robust
indian conducted us by the way of barigon and caney to the village
of maniquarez which was four hours' walk from the effect of the
reverberation of the sands the thermometer kept up to 313
degrees the cylindric cactus which bordered the road gave the
landscape an appearance of verdure without affording either
coolness or shade before our guide had walked a league he began
to sit down every moment and at length he wished to repose under
the shade of a fine tamarind tree near casas de la vela to await
the approach of night this characteristic trait which we observed
every time we travelled with indians has given rise to very
erroneous ideas of the physical constitutions of the different
races of men the copper-coloured native more accustomed to the
burning heat of the climate than the european traveller complains
more because he is stimulated by no interest money is without
attraction for him and if he permits himself to be tempted by gain
for a moment he repents of his resolution as soon as he is on the
road the same indian who would complain when in herborizing we
loaded him with a box filled with plants would row his canoe
fourteen or fifteen hours together against the strongest current
because he wished to return to his family in order to form a true
judgment of the muscular strength of the people we should observe
them in circumstances where their actions are determined by a
necessity and a will equally energetic

we examined the ruins of santiago* the structure of which is
remarkable for its extreme solidity (* on the map accompanying
robertson's history of america we find the name of this castle
confounded with that of nueva cordoba this latter denomination was
formerly synonymous with cumana herrera page 14) the walls of
freestone five feet thick have been blown up by mines but we
still found masses of seven or eight hundred feet square which
have scarcely a crack in them our guide showed us a cistern
(aljibe) thirty feet deep which though much damaged furnishes
water to the inhabitants of the peninsula of araya this cistern
was finished in 1681 by the governor don juan de padilla
guardiola the same who built at cumana the small fort of santa
maria as the basin is covered with an arched vault the water
which is of excellent quality keeps very cool the confervae
while they decompose the carburetted hydrogen also shelter worms
which hinder the propagation of small insects it had been believed
for ages that the peninsula of araya was entirely destitute of
springs of fresh water but in 1797 after many useless researches
the inhabitants of maniquarez succeeded in discovering some

in crossing the arid hills of cape cirial we perceived a strong
smell of petroleum the wind blew from the direction in which the
springs of this substance are found and which were mentioned by
the first historians of these countries* (* oviedo terms it "a
resinous aromatic and medicinal liquor") near the village of
maniquarez the mica-slate* (* the piedra pelada of the creoles)
comes out from below the secondary rock forming a chain of
mountains from one hundred and fifty to one hundred and eighty
toises in height the direction of the primitive rock near cape
sotto is from north-east to south-west its strata incline fifty
degrees to the north-west the mica-slate is silvery white of
lamellar and undulated texture and contains garnets strata of
quartz the thickness of which varies from three to four toises
traverse the mica-slate as we may observe in several ravines
hollowed out by the waters we detached with difficulty a fragment
of cyanite from a block of splintered and milky quartz which was
isolated on the shore this was the only time we found this
substance in south america* (* in new spain the cyanite has been
discovered only in the province of guatimala at estancia
grande del rio tablas min 1804 page 27)

the potteries of maniquarez celebrated from time immemorial form
a branch of industry which is exclusively in the hands of the
indian women the manufacture is still carried on according to the
method used before the conquest it indicates both the infancy of
the art and that unchangeability of manners which is
characteristic of all the natives of america three centuries have
been insufficient to introduce the potter's-wheel on a coast which
is not above thirty or forty days' sail from spain the natives
have some confused notions with respect to the existence of this
machine and they would no doubt make use of it if it were
introduced among them the quarries whence they obtain the clay are
half a league to the east of maniquarez this clay is produced by
natural decomposition of a mica-slate reddened by oxide of iron
the indian women prefer the part most abounding in mica and with
great skill fashion vessels two or three feet in diameter giving
them a very regular curve as they are not acquainted with the use
of ovens they place twigs of desmanthus cassia and the
arborescent capparis around the pots and bake them in the open
air to the east of the quarry which furnishes the clay is the
ravine of la mina it is asserted that a short time after the
conquest some venetians extracted gold from the mica-slate it
appears that this metal was not collected in veins of quartz but
was found disseminated in the rock as it is sometimes in granite
and gneiss

at maniquarez we met with some creoles who had been hunting at
cubagua deer of a small breed are so common in this uninhabited
islet that a single individual may kill three or four in a day i
know not by what accident these animals have got thither for laet
and other chroniclers of these countries speaking of the
foundation of new cadiz mention only the great abundance of
rabbits the venado of cubagua belongs to one of those numerous
species of small american deer which zoologists have long
confounded under the vague name of cervus mexicanus it does not
appear to be the same as the hind of the savannahs of cayenne or
the guazuti of paraguay which live also in herds its colour is a
brownish red on the back and white under the belly and it is
spotted like the axis in the plains of cari we were shown as a
thing very rare in these hot climates a variety quite white it
was a female of the size of the roebuck of europe and of a very
elegant shape white varieties are found in the new continent even
among the tigers azara saw a jaguar the skin of which was wholly
white with merely the shadow as it might be termed of a few
circular spots

of all the productions on the coasts of araya that which the
people consider as the most extraordinary or we may say the most
marvellous is 'the stone of the eyes' (piedra de los ojos) this
calcareous substance is a frequent subject of conversation being
according to the natural philosophy of the natives both a stone
and an animal it is found in the sand where it is motionless but
if placed on a polished surface for instance on a pewter or
earthen plate it moves when excited by lemon juice if placed in
the eye the supposed animal turns on itself and expels every
other foreign substance that has been accidentally introduced at
the new salt-works and at the village of maniquarez these stones
of the eyes* were offered to us by hundreds and the natives were
anxious to show us the experiment of the lemon juice (* they are
found in the greatest abundance near the battery at the point of
cape araya) they even wished to put sand into our eyes in order
that we might ourselves try the efficacy of the remedy it was easy
to see that the stones are thin and porous opercula which have
formed part of small univalve shells their diameter varies from
one to four lines one of their two surfaces is plane and the
other convex these calcareous opercula effervesce with lemon
juice and put themselves in motion in proportion as the carbonic
acid is disengaged by the effect of a similar reaction loaves
placed in an oven move sometimes on a horizontal plane a
phenomenon that has given occasion in europe to the popular
prejudice of enchanted ovens the piedras de los ojos introduced
into the eye act like the small pearls and different round grains
employed by the american savages to increase the flowing of tears
these explanations were little to the taste of the inhabitants of
araya nature has the appearance of greatness to man in proportion
as she is veiled in mystery and the ignorant are prone to put
faith in everything that borders on the marvellous

proceeding along the southern coast to the east of maniquarez we
find running out into the sea very near each other three strips of
land bearing the names of punta de soto punta de la brea and
punta guaratarito in these parts the bottom of the sea is
evidently formed of mica-slate and from it near cape de la brea
but at eighty feet distant from the shore there issues a spring of
naphtha the smell of which penetrates into the interior of the
peninsula it is necessary to wade into the sea up to the waist to
examine this interesting phenomenon the waters are covered with
zostera and in the midst of a very extensive bank of weeds we
distinguish a free and circular spot of three feet in diameter on
which float a few scattered masses of ulva lactuca here the
springs are found the bottom of the gulf is covered with sand and
the petroleum which from its transparency and its yellow colour
resembles naphtha rises in jets accompanied by air bubbles on
treading down the bottom with the foot we perceive that these
little springs change their place the naphtha covers the surface
of the sea to more than a thousand feet distant if we suppose the
dip of the strata to be regular the mica-slate must be but a few
toises below the sand

we have already observed that the muriatiferous clay of araya
contains solid and friable petroleum this geological connection
between the muriate of soda and the bitumens is evident wherever
there are mines of sal-gem or salt springs but a very remarkable
fact is the existence of a fountain of naphtha in a primitive
formation all those hitherto known belong to secondary mountains*
(* as at pietra mala fanano mont zibio and amiano (in these
places are found the springs that furnish the naphtha burned in
lamps in genoa) and also at baikal) a circumstance which has been
supposed to favour the idea that all mineral bitumens are owing to
the destruction of vegetables and animals or to the burning of
coal in the peninsula of araya the naphtha flows from the
primitive rock itself and this phenomenon acquires new importance
when we recollect that the same primitive rocks contain the
subterranean fires that on the brink of burning craters the smell
of petroleum is perceived from time to time and that the greater
part of the hot springs of america rise from gneiss and micaceous
schist

after having examined the environs of maniquarez we embarked at
night in a fishing-boat for cumana the small crazy boats employed
by the natives here bear testimony to the extreme calmness of the
sea in these regions our boat though the best we could procure
was so leaky that the pilot's son was constantly employed in
baling out the water with a tutuma or shell of the crescentia
cujete (calabash) it often happens in the gulf of cariaco and
especially to the north of the peninsula of araya that canoes
laden with cocoa-nuts are upset in sailing too near the wind and
against the tide

the inhabitants of araya whom we visited a second time on
returning from the orinoco have not forgotten that their peninsula
was one of the points first peopled by the spaniards they love to
talk of the pearl fishery of the ruins of the castle of santiago
which they hope to see some day rebuilt and of everything that
recalls to mind the ancient splendour of those countries in china
and japan those inventions are considered as recent which have not
been known above two thousand years in the european colonies an
event appears extremely old if it dates back three centuries or
about the period of the discovery of america

mountains of new andalucia
valley of the cumanacoa
summit of the cocollar
missions of the chayma indians

our first visit to the peninsula of araya was soon succeeded by an
excursion to the mountains of the missions of the chayma indians
where a variety of interesting objects claimed our attention we
entered on a country studded with forests and visited a convent
surrounded by palm-trees and arborescent ferns it was situated in
a narrow valley where we felt the enjoyment of a cool and
delicious climate in the centre of the torrid zone the
surrounding mountains contain caverns haunted by thousands of
nocturnal birds and what affects the imagination more than all
the wonders of the physical world we find beyond these mountains a
people lately nomad and still nearly in a state of nature wild
without being barbarous it was in the promontory of paria that
columbus first descried the continent there terminate these
valleys laid waste alternately by the warlike anthropophagic carib
and by the commercial and polished nations of europe at the
beginning of the sixteenth century the ill-fated indians of the
coasts of carupano of macarapan and of caracas were treated in
the same manner as the inhabitants of the coast of guinea in our
days the soil of the islands was cultivated the vegetable produce
of the old world was transplanted thither but a regular system of
colonization remained long unknown on the new continent if the
spaniards visited its shores it was only to procure either by
violence or exchange slaves pearls grains of gold and
dye-woods and endeavours were made to ennoble the motives of this
insatiable avarice by the pretence of enthusiastic zeal in the
cause of religion

the trade in the copper-coloured indians was accompanied by the
same acts of inhumanity as that which characterizes the traffic in
african negroes it was attended also by the same result that of
rendering both the conquerors and the conquered more ferocious
thence wars became more frequent among the natives prisoners were
dragged from the inland countries to the coast to be sold to the
whites who loaded them with chains in their ships yet the
spaniards were at that period and long after one of the most
polished nations of europe the light which art and literature then
shed over italy was reflected on every nation whose language
emanated from the same source as that of dante and petrarch it
might have been expected that a general improvement of manners
would be the natural consequence of this noble awakening of the
mind this sublime soaring of the imagination but in distant
regions wherever the thirst of wealth has introduced the abuse of
power the nations of europe at every period of their history
have displayed the same character the illustrious era of leo x was
signalized in the new world by acts of cruelty that seemed to
belong to the most barbarous ages we are less surprised however
at the horrible picture presented by the conquest of america when
we think of the acts that are still perpetrated on the western
coast of africa notwithstanding the benefits of a more humane
legislation

the principles adopted by charles v had abolished the slave trade
on the new continent but the conquistadores by the continuation
of their incursions prolonged the system of petty warfare which
diminished the american population perpetuated national
animosities and during a long period crushed the seeds of rising
civilization at length the missionaries under the protection of
the secular arm spoke words of peace it was the privilege of
religion to console humanity for a part of the evils committed in
its name to plead the cause of the natives before kings to resist
the violence of the commendatories and to assemble wandering
tribes into small communities called missions

but these institutions useful at first in stopping the effusion of
blood and in laying the first basis of society have become in
their result hostile to its progress the effects of this insulated
system have been such that the indians have remained in a state
little different from that in which they existed whilst yet their
scattered dwellings were not collected round the habitation of a
missionary their number has considerably augmented but the sphere
of their ideas is not enlarged they have progressively lost that
vigour of character and that natural vivacity which in every state
of society are the noble fruits of independence by subjecting to
invariable rules even the slightest actions of their domestic life
they have been rendered stupid by the effort to render them
obedient their subsistence is in general more certain and their
habits more pacific but subject to the constraint and the dull
monotony of the government of the missions they show by their
gloomy and reserved looks that they have not sacrificed their
liberty to their repose without regret

on the 4th of september at five in the morning we began our
journey to the missions of the chayma indians and the group of
lofty mountains which traverse new andalusia on account of the
extreme difficulties of the road we had been advised to reduce our
baggage to a very small bulk two beasts of burden were sufficient
to carry our provision our instruments and the paper necessary to
dry our plants one chest contained a sextant a dipping-needle an
apparatus to determine the magnetic variation a few thermometers
and saussure's hygrometer the greatest changes in the pressure of
the air in these climates on the coasts amount only to 1 to 13
of a line and if at any given hour or place the height of the
mercury be once marked the variations which that height
experiences throughout the whole year at every hour of the day or
night may with some accuracy be determined

the morning was deliciously cool the road or rather path which
leads to cumanacoa runs along the right bank of the manzanares
passing by the hospital of the capuchins situated in a small wood
of lignum-vitae and arborescent capparis* (* these caper-trees are
called in the country by the names pachaca olivo and ajito they
are the capparis tenuisiliqua jacq c ferruginea c emarginata
c elliptica c reticulata c racemosa) on leaving cumana we
enjoyed during the short duration of the twilight from the top of
the hill of san francisco an extensive view over the sea the
plain covered with bera* and its golden flowers (* palo sano
zygophyllum arboreum jacq the flowers have the smell of vanilla
it is cultivated in the gardens of the havannah under the strange
name of the dictanno real (royal dittany)) and the mountains of
the brigantine we were struck by the great proximity in which the
cordillera appeared before the disk of the rising sun had reached
the horizon the tint of the summits is of a deeper blue their
outline is more strongly marked and their masses are more
detached as long as the transparency of the air is undisturbed by
the vapours which after accumulating during the night in the
valleys rise in proportion as the atmosphere acquires warmth

at the hospital of the divina pastora the path turns to north-east
and stretches for two leagues over a soil without trees and
formerly levelled by the waters we there found not only cactuses
tufts of cistus-leaved tribulus and the beautiful purple
euphorbia* (* euphorbia tithymaloides) but also the avicennia
the allionia the sesuvium the thalinum and most of the
portulaceous plants which grow on the banks of the gulf of cariaco
this geographical distribution of plants appears to designate the
limits of the ancient coast and to prove that the hills along the
southern side of which we were passing formed heretofore a small
island separated from the continent by an arm of the sea

after walking two hours we arrived at the foot of the high chain
of the interior mountains which stretches from east to west from
the brigantine to the cerro de san lorenzo there new rocks
appear and with them another aspect of vegetation every object
assumes a more majestic and picturesque character the soil
watered by springs is furrowed in every direction trees of
gigantic height covered with lianas rise from the ravines their
bark black and burnt by the double action of the light and the
oxygen of the atmosphere contrasts with the fresh verdure of the
pothos and dracontium the tough and shining leaves of which are
sometimes several feet long the parasite monocotyledons take
between the tropics the place of the moss and lichens of our
northern zone as we advanced the forms and grouping of the rocks
reminded us of switzerland and the tyrol the heliconia costus
maranta and other plants of the family of the balisiers (canna
indica) which near the coasts vegetate only in damp and low
places flourish in the american alps at considerable height thus
by a singular similitude in the torrid zone under the influence
of an atmosphere continually loaded with vapours the mountain
vegetation presents the same features as the vegetation of the
marshes in the north of europe on soil moistened by melting snow*
(* wahlenberg de vegetatione helvetiae et summi septentrionis
pages 47 59)

before we leave the plains of cumana and the breccia or
calcareous sandstone which constitutes the soil of the seaside we
will describe the different strata of which this very recent
formation is composed as we observed it on the back of the hills
that surround the castle of san antonio

this breccia or calcareous sandstone is a local and partial
formation peculiar to the peninsula of araya the coasts of
cumana and caracas we again found it at cabo blanco to the west
of the port of guayra where it contains besides broken shells and
madrepores fragments often angular of quartz and gneiss this
circumstance assimilates the breccia to that recent sandstone
called by the german mineralogists nagelfluhe which covers so
great a part of switzerland to the height of a thousand toises
without presenting any trace of marine productions near cumana the
formation of the calcareous breccia contains first a compact
whitish grey limestone the strata of which sometimes horizontal
sometimes irregularly inclined are from five to six inches thick
some beds are almost unmixed with petrifactions but in the
greatest part the cardites the turbinites the ostracites and
shells of small dimension are found so closely connected that the
calcareous matter forms only a cement by which the grains of
quartz and the organized bodies are united second a calcareous
sandstone in which the grains of sand are much more frequent than
the petrified shells other strata form a sandstone entirely free
from organic fragments yielding but a small effervescence with
acids and enclosing not lamellae of mica but nodules of compact
brown iron-ore third beds of indurated clay containing selenite
and lamellar gypsum

the breccia or agglomerate of the sea-coast just described has a
white tint and it lies immediately on the calcareous formation of
cumanacoa which is of a bluish grey these two rocks form a
contrast no less striking than the molasse (bur-stone) of the pays
de vaud with the calcareous limestone of the jura it must be
observed that by contact of the two formations lying upon each
other the beds of the limestone of cumanacoa which i consider as
an alpine limestone are always largely mixed with clay and marl
lying like the mica-slate of araya north-east and south-west
they are inclined near punta delgada under an angle of 60
degrees to south-east

we traversed the forest by a narrow path along a rivulet which
rolls foaming over a bed of rocks we observed that the vegetation
was more brilliant wherever the alpine limestone was covered by a
quartzose sandstone without petrifactions and very different from
the breccia of the sea-coast the cause of this phenomenon depends
probably not so much on the nature of the ground as on the greater
humidity of the soil the quartzose sandstone contains thin strata
of a blackish clay-slate* (* schieferthon) which might easily be
confounded with the secondary thonschiefer and these strata hinder
the water from filtering into the crevices of which the alpine
limestone is full this last offers to view here as in saltzburg
and on the chain of the apennines broken and steep beds the
sandstone on the contrary wherever it is seated on the calcareous
rock renders the aspect of the scene less wild the hills which it
forms appear more rounded and the gentler slopes are covered with
a thicker mould

in humid places where the sandstone envelopes the alpine
limestone some trace of cultivation is constantly found we met
with huts inhabited by mestizoes in the ravine of los frailes as
well as between the cuesta de caneyes and the rio guriental each
of these huts stands in the centre of an enclosure containing
plantains papaw-trees sugar-canes and maize we might be
surprised at the small extent of these cultivated spots if we did
not recollect that an acre planted with plantains* (* musa
paradisiaca) produces nearly twenty times as much food as the same
space sown with corn in europe our wheat barley and rye cover
vast spaces of ground and in general the arable lands touch each
other wherever the inhabitants live upon corn it is different
under the torrid zone where man obtains food from plants which
yield more abundant and earlier harvests in those favoured climes
the fertility of the soil is proportioned to the heat and humidity
of the atmosphere an immense population finds abundant nourishment
within a narrow space covered with plantains cassava yams and
maize the isolated situation of the huts dispersed through the
forest indicates to the traveller the fecundity of nature where a
small spot of cultivated land suffices for the wants of several
families

these considerations on the agriculture of the torrid zone
involuntarily remind us of the intimate connexion existing between
the extent of land cleared and the progress of society the
richness of the soil and the vigour of organic life by
multiplying the means of subsistence retard the progress of
nations in the paths of civilization under so mild and uniform a
climate the only urgent want of man is that of food this want
only excites him to labour and we may easily conceive why in the
midst of abundance beneath the shade of the plantain and
bread-fruit tree the intellectual faculties unfold themselves less
rapidly than under a rigorous sky in the region of corn where our
race is engaged in a perpetual struggle with the elements in
europe we estimate the number of the inhabitants of a country by
the extent of cultivation within the tropics on the contrary in
the warmest and most humid parts of south america very populous
provinces appear almost deserted because man to find nourishment
cultivates but a small number of acres these circumstances modify
the physical appearance of the country and the character of its
inhabitants giving to both a peculiar physiognomy the wild and
uncultivated stamp which belongs to nature ere its primitive type
has been altered by art without neighbours almost unconnected
with the rest of mankind each family of settlers forms a separate
tribe this insulated state arrests or retards the progress of
civilization which advances only in proportion as society becomes
numerous and its connexions more intimate and multiplied but on
the other hand it is solitude that develops and strengthens in man
the sentiment of liberty and independence and gives birth to that
noble pride of character which has at all times distinguished the
castilian race

from these causes the land in the most populous regions of
equinoctial america still retains a wild aspect which is destroyed
in temperate climates by the cultivation of corn within the
tropics the agricultural nations occupy less ground man has there
less extended his empire he may be said to appear not as an
absolute master who changes at will the surface of the soil but
as a transient guest who quietly enjoys the gifts of nature
there in the neighbourhood of the most populous cities the land
remains studded with forests or covered with a thick mould
unfurrowed by the plough spontaneous vegetation still predominates
over cultivated plants and determines the aspect of the landscape
it is probable that this state of things will change very slowly
if in our temperate regions the cultivation of corn contributes to
throw a dull uniformity upon the land we have cleared we cannot
doubt that even with increasing population the torrid zone will
preserve that majesty of vegetable forms those marks of an
unsubdued virgin nature which render it so attractive and so
picturesque thus it is that by a remarkable concatenation of
physical and moral causes the choice and production of alimentary
plants have an influence on three important objects at once the
association or the isolated state of families the more or less
rapid progress of civilization and the individual character of the
landscape

in proportion as we penetrated into the forest the barometer
indicated the progressive elevation of the land the trunks of the
trees presented here an extraordinary phenomenon a gramineous
plant with verticillate branches* climbs like a liana eight or
ten feet high and forms festoons which cross the path and swing
about with the wind (* carice analogous to the chusque of santa
fe of the group of the nastusas this gramineous plant is
excellent pasture for mules) we halted about three o'clock in the
afternoon on a small flat known by the name of quetepe and
situated about one hundred and ninety toises above the level of the
sea a few small houses have been erected near a spring well known
by the natives for its coolness and great salubrity we found the
water delicious its temperature was only 225 degrees of the
centigrade thermometer while that of the air was 287 degrees the
springs which descend from the neighbouring mountains of a greater
height often indicate a too rapid decrement of heat if indeed we
suppose the mean temperature of the water on the coast of cumana
equal to 26 degrees we must conclude unless other local causes
modify the temperature of the springs that the spring of quetepe
acquires its great coolness at more than 350 toises of absolute
elevation with respect to the springs which gush out in the plains
of the torrid zone or at a small elevation it may be observed in
general that it is only in regions where the mean temperature of
summer essentially differs from that of the whole year that the
inhabitants have extremely cold spring water during the season of
great heat the laplanders near umea and soersele in the 65th
degree of latitude drink spring-water the temperature of which
in the month of august is scarcely two or three degrees above
freezing point while during the day the heat of the air rises in
the shade in the same northern regions to 26 or 27 degrees in
the temperate climates of france and germany the difference
between the air and the springs never exceeds 16 or 17 degrees
between the tropics it seldom rises to 5 or 6 degrees it is easy
to account for these phenomena when we recollect that the interior
of the globe and the subterraneous waters have a temperature
almost identical with the annual mean temperature of the air and
that the latter differs from the mean heat of summer in proportion
to the distance from the equator

from the top of a hill of sandstone which overlooks the spring of
quetepe we had a magnificent view of the sea of cape macanao and
the peninsula of maniquarez at our feet an immense forest extended
to the edge of the ocean the tops of the trees intertwined with
lianas and crowned with long wreaths of flowers formed a vast
carpet of verdure the dark tint of which augmented the splendour
of the aerial light this picture struck us the more forcibly as
we then first beheld those great masses of tropical vegetation on
the hill of quetepe at the foot of the malpighia cocollobaefolia
the leaves of which are extremely coriaceous we gathered among
tufts of the polygala montana the first melastomas especially
that beautiful species described under the name of the melastoma
rufescens

as we advanced toward the south-west the soil became dry and
sandy we climbed a group of mountains which separate the coast
from the vast plains or savannahs bordered by the orinoco that
part of the group over which passes the road to cumanacoa is
destitute of vegetation and has steep declivities both on the
north and the south it has received the name of the imposible
because it is believed that in the case of hostile invasion this
ridge of mountains would be inaccessible to the enemy and would
offer an asylum to the inhabitants of cumana we reached the top a
little before sunset and i had scarcely time to take a few horary
angles to determine the longitude of the place by means of the
chronometer

the view from the imposible is finer and more extensive than that
from the table-land of quetepe we distinguished clearly by the
naked eye the flattened top of the brigantine (the position of
which it would be important to fix accurately) the embarcadero or
landing-place and the roadstead of cumana the rocky coast of the
peninsula of araya was discernible in its whole length we were
particularly struck with the extraordinary configuration of a port
known by the name of laguna grande or laguna del obispo a vast
basin surrounded by high mountains communicates with the gulf of
cariaco by a narrow channel which admits only of the passage of one
ship at a time this port is capable of containing several
squadrons at once it is an uninhabited place but annually
frequented by vessels which carry mules to the west india islands
there are some pasture grounds at the farther end of the bay we
traced the sinuosities of this arm of the sea which like a river
has dug a bed between perpendicular rocks destitute of vegetation
this singular prospect reminded us of the fanciful landscape which
leonardo da vinci has made the back-ground of his famous portrait
of mona lisa the wife of francisco del giacondo

we could observe by the chronometer the moment when the disk of the
sun touched the horizon of the sea the first contact was at 6
hours 8 minutes 13 seconds the second at 6 hours 10 minutes 26
seconds mean time this observation which is not unimportant for
the theory of terrestrial refractions was made on the summit of
the mountain at the absolute height of 296 toises the setting of
the sun was attended by a very rapid cooling of the air three
minutes after the last apparent contact of the disk with the
horizon of the sea the thermometer suddenly fell from 252 to 213
degrees was this extraordinary refrigeration owing to some
descending current? the air was however calm and no horizontal
wind was felt

we passed the night in a house where there was a military post
consisting of eight men under the command of a spanish serjeant
it was an hospital built by the side of a powder magazine when
cumana after the capture of trinidad by the english in 1797 was
threatened with an attack many of the inhabitants fled to
cumanacoa and deposited whatever articles of value they possessed
in sheds hastily constructed on the top of the imposible it was
then resolved in case of any unforeseen invasion to abandon the
castle of san antonio after a short resistance and to concentrate
the whole force of the province round the mountains which may be
considered as the key of the llanos

the top of the imposible as nearly as i could perceive is covered
with a quartzose sandstone free from petrifactions here as on
the ridge of the neighbouring mountains the strata pretty
regularly take the direction from north-north-east to
south-south-west this direction is also most common in the
primitive formations in the peninsula of araya and along the
coasts of venezuela on the northern declivity of the imposible
near the penas negras an abundant spring issues from sandstone
which alternates with a schistose clay we remarked on this point
fractured strata which lie from north-west to south-east and the
dip of which is almost perpendicular

the llaneros or inhabitants of the plains send their produce
especially maize leather and cattle to the port of cumana by the
road over the imposible we continually saw mules arrive driven by
indians or mulattoes several parts of the vast forests which
surround the mountain had taken fire reddish flames half
enveloped in clouds of smoke presented a very grand spectacle the
inhabitants set fire to the forests to improve the pasturage and
to destroy the shrubs that choke the grass enormous
conflagrations too are often caused by the carelessness of the
indians who neglect when they travel to extinguish the fires by
which they have dressed their food these accidents contribute to
diminish the number of old trees in the road from cumana to
cumanacoa and the inhabitants observe justly that in several
parts of their province the dryness has increased not only
because every year the frequency of earthquakes causes more
crevices in the soil but also because it is now less thickly
wooded than it was at the time of the conquest

i arose during the night to determine the latitude of the place by
the passage of fomalhaut over the meridian but the observation was
lost owing to the time i employed in taking the level of the
artificial horizon it was midnight and i was benumbed with cold
as were also our guides yet the thermometer kept at 197 degrees
at cumana i have never seen it sink below 21 degrees but then the
house in which we dwelt on the imposible was 258 toises above the
level of the sea at the casa de la polvora i determined the dip of
the magnetic needle which was 425 degrees* (* the magnetic dip
is always measured in this work according to the centesimal
division if the contrary be not expressly mentioned) the number
of oscillations correspondent to 10 minutes of time was 233 the
intensity of the magnetic forces had consequently augmented from
the coast to the mountain perhaps from the influence of some
ferruginous matter hidden in the strata of sandstone which cover
the alpine limestone

we left the imposible on the 5th of september before sunrise the
descent is very dangerous for beasts of burden the path being in
general but fifteen inches broad and bordered by precipices in
descending the mountain we observed the rock of alpine limestone
reappearing under the sandstone the strata being generally
inclined to the south and south-east a great number of springs
gush out on the southern side of the mountain in the rainy season
of the year these springs form torrents which descend in
cascades shaded by the hura the cuspa and the silver-leaved
cecropia or trumpet-tree

the cuspa a very common tree in the environs of cumana and of
bordones is yet unknown to the botanists of europe it was long
used only for the building of houses and has become celebrated
since 1797 under the name of the cascarilla or bark-tree
(cinchona) of new andalusia its trunk rises scarcely above fifteen
or twenty feet its alternate leaves are smooth entire and oval*
(* at the summit of the boughs the leaves are sometimes opposite
to each other but invariably without stipules) its bark very
thin and of a pale yellow is a powerful febrifuge it is even
more bitter than the bark of the real cinchona but is less
disagreeable the cuspa is administered with the greatest success
in a spirituous tincture and in aqueous infusion both in
intermittent and in malignant fevers

on the coasts of new andalusia the cuspa is considered as a kind
of cinchona and we were assured that some aragonese monks who
had long resided in the kingdom of new grenada recognised this
tree from the resemblance of its leaves to those of the real
peruvian bark-tree this however is unfounded since it is
precisely by the disposition of the leaves and the absence of
stipules that the cuspa differs totally from the trees of the
rubiaceous family it may be said to resemble the family of the
honeysuckle or caprifoliaceous plants one section of which has
alternate leaves and among which we find several cornel-trees
remarkable for their febrifuge properties* (* cornus florida and
c sericea of the united states walker on the virtues of the
cornus and the cinchona compared philadelphia 1803)

the taste at once bitter and astringent and the yellow colour of
the bark led to the discovery of the febrifugal virtue of the
cuspa as it blossoms at the end of november we did not see it in
flower and we know not to what genus it belongs and i have in
vain for several years past applied to our friends at cumana for
specimens of the flower and fruit i hope that the botanical
determination of the bark-tree of new andalusia will one day fix
the attention of travellers who visit this region after us and
that they will not confound notwithstanding the analogy of the
names the cuspa with the cuspare the latter not only vegetates in
the missions of the rio carony but also to the west of cumana in
the gulf of santa fe it furnishes the druggists of europe with the
famous cortex angosturae and forms the genus bonplandia described
by m willdenouw in the memoirs of the academy of berlin from
notes communicated to him by us

it is singular that during our long abode on the coast of cumana
and the caracas on the banks of the apure the orinoco and the
rio negro in an extent of country comprising forty thousand square
leagues we never met with one of those numerous species of
cinchona or exostema which are peculiar to the low and warm
regions of the tropics especially to the archipelago of the west
india islands yet we are far from affirming that throughout the
whole of the eastern part of south america from porto bello to
cayenne or from the equator to the 10th degree of north latitude
between the meridians of 54 and 71 degrees the cinchona absolutely
does not exist how can we be expected to know completely the flora
of so vast an extent of country? but when we recollect that even
in mexico no species of the genera cinchona and exostema has been
discovered either in the central table-land or in the plains we
are led to believe that the mountainous islands of the west indies
and the cordillera of the andes have peculiar floras and that they
possess particular species of vegetation which have neither passed
from the islands to the continent nor from south america to the
coasts of new spain

it may be observed farther that when we reflect on the numerous
analogies which exist between the properties of plants and their
external forms we are surprised to find qualities eminently
febrifuge in the bark of trees belonging to different genera and
even different families* (* it may be somewhat interesting to
chemistry physiology and descriptive botany to consider under
the same point of view the plants which have been employed in
intermittent fevers with different degrees of success we find
among rubiaceous plants besides the cinchonas and exostemas the
coutarea speciosa or cayenne bark the portlandia grandiflora of
the west indies another portlandia discovered by m sesse at
mexico the pinkneia pubescens of the united states the berry of
the coffee-tree and perhaps the macrocnemum corymbosum and the
guettarda coccinea among magnoliaceous plants the tulip-tree and
the magnolia glauca among zanthoxylaceous plants the cuspare of
angostura known in america under the name of orinoco bark and the
zanthoxylon caribaeum among leguminous plants the geoffraeas the
swietenia febrifuga the aeschynomene grandiflora the caesalpina
bonducella among caprifoliaceous plants the cornus florida and
the cuspa of cumana among rosaceous plants the cerasus virginiana
and the geum urbanum among amentaceous plants the willows oaks
and birch-trees of which the alcoholic tincture is used in russia
by the common people the populus tremuloides etc among
anonaceous plants the uvaria febrifuga the fruit of which we saw
administered with success in the missions of spanish guiana among
simarubaceous plants the quassia amara celebrated in the feverish
plains of surinam among terebinthaceous plants the rhus glabrum
among euphorbiaceous plants the croton cascarilla among composite
plants the eupatorium perfoliatum the febrifuge qualities of
which are known to the savages of north america of the tulip-tree
and the quassia it is the bark of the roots that is used eminent
febrifuge virtues have also been found in the cortical part of the
roots of the cinchona condaminea at loxa but it is fortunate for
the preservation of the species that the roots of the real
cinchona are not employed in pharmacy chemical researches are yet
wanting upon the very powerful bitters contained in the roots of
the zanthoriza apiifolia and the actaea racemosa the latter have
sometimes been employed with success as a remedy against the
epidemic yellow fever in new york) some of these barks so much
resemble each other that it is not easy to distinguish them at
first sight but before we examine the question whether we shall
one day discover in the real cinchona in the cuspa of cumana the
cortex angosturae the indian swietenia the willows of europe the
berries of the coffee-tree and uvaria a matter uniformly diffused
and exhibiting (like starch caoutchouc and camphor) the same
chemical properties in different plants we may ask whether in the
present state of physiology and medicine a febrifuge principle
ought to be admitted is it not probable that the particular
derangement in the organization known under the vague name of the
febrile state and in which both the vascular and the nervous
systems are at the same time attacked yields to remedies which do
not operate by the same principle by the same mode of action on
the same organs by the same play of chemical and electrical
attractions? we shall here confine ourselves to this observation
that in the species of the genus cinchona the antifebrile virtues
do not appear to belong to the tannin (which is only accidentally
mingled in them) or to the cinchonate of lime but in a resiniform
matter soluble both by alcohol and by water and which it is
believed is composed of two principles the cinchonic bitter and
the cinchonic red* (* in french l'amer et le rouge cinchoniques)
may it then be admitted that this resiniform matter which
possesses different degrees of energy according to the combinations
by which it is modified is found in all febrifuge substances?
those by which the sulphate of iron is precipitated of a green
colour like the real cinchona the bark of the white willow and
the horned perisperm of the coffee-tree do not on this account
denote identity of chemical composition* and that identity might
even exist without our concluding that the medical virtues were
analogous (* the cuspare bark (cort angosturae) yields with iron
a yellow precipitate yet it is employed on the banks of the
orinoco and particularly at the town of st thomas of angostura
as an excellent cinchona and on the other hand the bark of the
common cherry tree which has scarcely any febrifuge quality
yields a green precipitate like the real cinchonas notwithstanding
the extreme imperfection of vegetable chemistry the experiments
already made on cinchonas sufficiently show that to judge of the
febrifuge virtues of a bark we must not attach too much importance
either to the principle which turns to green the oxides of iron or
to the tannin or to the matter which precipitates infusions of
tan) we see that specimens of sugar and tannin extracted from
plants not of the same family present numerous differences while
the comparative analysis of sugar gum and starch the discovery
of the radical of the prussic acid (the effects of which are so
powerful on the organization) and many other phenomena of
vegetable chemistry clearly prove that substances composed of
identical elements few in number and proportional in quantity
exhibit the most heterogeneous properties on account of that
particular mode of combination which corpuscular chemistry calls
the arrangement of the particles

leaving the ravine which descends from the imposible we entered a
thick forest traversed by many small rivers which are easily
forded we observed that the cecropia which in the disposition of
its branches and its slender trunk resembles the palm-tree is
covered with leaves more or less silvery in proportion as the soil
is dry or moist we saw some small plants of the cecropia the
leaves of which were on both sides entirely green* (* is not the
cecropia concolor of willdenouw a variety of the cecropia peltata?)
the roots of these trees are hid under tufts of dorstenia which
flourishes only in humid and shady places in the midst of the
forest on the banks of the rio cedeno as well as on the southern
declivity of the cocollar we find in their wild state papaw and
orange-trees bearing large and sweet fruit these are probably the
remains of some conucos or indian plantations for in those
countries the orange-tree cannot be counted among the indigenous
plants any more than the banana-tree the papaw-tree maize
cassava and many other useful plants with the true country of
which we are unacquainted though they have accompanied man in his
migrations from the remotest times

when a traveller newly arrived from europe penetrates for the first
time into the forests of south america he beholds nature under an
unexpected aspect he feels at every step that he is not on the
confines but in the centre of the torrid zone not in one of the
west india islands but on a vast continent where everything is
gigantic mountains rivers and the mass of vegetation if he
feel strongly the beauty of picturesque scenery he can scarcely
define the various emotions which crowd upon his mind he can
scarcely distinguish what most excites his admiration the deep
silence of those solitudes the individual beauty and contrast of
forms or that vigour and freshness of vegetable life which
characterize the climate of the tropics it might be said that the
earth overloaded with plants does not allow them space enough to
unfold themselves the trunks of the trees are everywhere concealed
under a thick carpet of verdure and if we carefully transplanted
the orchideae the pipers and the pothoses nourished by a single
courbaril or american fig-tree* (* ficus nymphaeifolia) we
should cover a vast extent of ground by this singular assemblage
the forests as well as the flanks of the rocks and mountains
enlarge the domains of organic nature the same lianas which creep
on the ground reach the tops of the trees and pass from one to
another at the height of more than a hundred feet thus by the
continual interlacing of parasite plants the botanist is often led
to confound one with another the flowers the fruits and leaves
which belong to different species

we walked for some hours under the shade of these arcades which
scarcely admit a glimpse of the sky the latter appeared to me of
an indigo blue the deeper in shade because the green of the
equinoctial plants is generally of a stronger hue with somewhat of
a brownish tint a great fern tree* (* possibly our aspidium
caducum) very different from the polypodium arboreum of the west
indies rose above masses of scattered rocks in this place we were
struck for the first time with the sight of those nests in the
shape of bottles or small bags which are suspended from the
branches of the lowest trees and which attest the wonderful
industry of the orioles which mingle their warbling with the
hoarse cries of the parrots and the macaws these last so well
known for their vivid colours fly only in pairs while the real
parrots wander about in flocks of several hundreds a man must have
lived in those regions particularly in the hot valleys of the
andes to conceive how these birds sometimes drown with their
voices the noise of the torrents which dash down from rock to
rock

we left the forests at the distance of somewhat more than a league
from the village of san fernando a narrow path led after many
windings into an open but extremely humid country in such a site
in the temperate zone the cyperaceous and gramineous plants would
have formed vast meadows here the soil abounded in aquatic plants
with sagittate leaves and especially in basil plants among which
we noticed the fine flowers of the costus the thalia and the
heliconia these succulent plants are from eight to ten feet high
and in europe one of their groups would be considered as a little
wood

near san fernando the evaporation caused by the action of the sun
was so great that being very lightly clothed we felt ourselves as
wet as in a vapour bath the road was bordered with a kind of
bamboo* (* bambusa guadua) which the indians call iagua or
guadua and which is more than forty feet in height nothing can
exceed the elegance of this arborescent gramen the form and
disposition of its leaves give it a character of lightness which
contrasts agreeably with its height the smooth and glossy trunk of
the iagua generally bends towards the banks of rivulets and it
waves with the slightest breath of air the highest reeds* in the
south of europe (* arundo donax) can give no idea of the aspect
of the arborescent gramina the bamboo and fern-tree are of all
the vegetable forms between the tropics those which make the most
powerful impression on the imagination of the traveller bamboos
are less common in south america than is usually believed they are
almost wanting in the marshes and in the vast inundated plains of
the lower orinoco the apure and the atabapo while they form
thick woods several leagues in length in the north-west in new
grenada and in the kingdom of quito it might be said that the
western declivity of the andes is their true country and what is
remarkable enough we found them not only in the low regions at the
level of the ocean but also in the lofty valleys of the
cordilleras at the height of 860 toises

the road skirted with the bamboos above mentioned led us to the
small village of san fernando situated in a narrow plain
surrounded by very steep calcareous rocks this was the first
mission* we saw in america (* a certain number of habitations
collected round a church with a missionary monk performing the
ministerial duties is called in the spanish colonies mision or
pueblo de mision indian villages governed by a priest are called
pueblos de doctrina a distinction is made between the cura
doctrinero who is the priest of an indian parish and the cura
rector priest of a village inhabited by whites and men of mixed
race) the houses or rather the huts of the chayma indians though
separate from each other are not surrounded by gardens the
streets which are wide and very straight cross each other at
right angles the walls of the huts are made of clay strengthened
by lianas the uniformity of these huts the grave and taciturn air
of their inhabitants and the extreme neatness of the dwellings
reminded us of the establishments of the moravian brethren besides
their own gardens every indian family helps to cultivate the
garden of the community or as it is called the conuco de la
comunidad which is situated at some distance from the village in
this conuco the adults of each sex work one hour in the morning and
one in the evening in the missions nearest the coast the garden of
the community is generally a sugar or indigo plantation under the
direction of the missionary and its produce if the law were
strictly observed could be employed only for the support of the
church and the purchase of sacerdotal ornaments the great square
of san fernando in the centre of the village contains the church
the dwelling of the missionary and a very humble-looking edifice
pompously called the king's house (casa del rey) this is a
caravanserai destined for lodging travellers and as we often
experienced infinitely valuable in a country where the name of an
inn is still unknown the casas del rey are to be found in all the
spanish colonies and may be deemed an imitation of the tambos of
peru which were established in conformity with the laws of manco
capac

we had been recommended to the friars who govern the missions of
the chayma indians by their syndic who resides at cumana this
recommendation was the more useful to us as the missionaries
either from zeal for the purity of the morals of their
parishioners or to conceal the monastic system from the indiscreet
curiosity of strangers often adhere with rigour to an old
regulation by which a white man of the secular state is not
permitted to sojourn more than one night in an indian village the
missions form (i will not say according to their primitive and
canonical institutions but in reality) a distinct and nearly
independent hierarchy the views of which seldom accord with those
of the secular clergy

the missionary of san fernando was a capuchin a native of aragon
far advanced in years but strong and healthy his extreme
corpulency his hilarity the interest he took in battles and
sieges ill accorded with the ideas we form in northern countries
of the melancholy reveries and the contemplative life of
missionaries though extremely busy about a cow which was to be
killed next day the old monk received us with kindness and
permitted us to hang up our hammocks in a gallery of his house
seated without doing anything the greater part of the day in an
armchair of red wood he bitterly complained of what he called the
indolence and ignorance of his countrymen our missionary however
seemed well satisfied with his situation

he treated the indians with mildness he beheld his mission
prosper and he praised with enthusiasm the waters the bananas
and the dairy-produce of the district the sight of our
instruments our books and our dried plants drew from him a
sarcastic smile and he acknowledged with the naivete peculiar to
the inhabitants of those countries that of all the enjoyments of
life without excepting sleep none was comparable to the pleasure
of eating good beef (carne de vaca) thus does sensuality obtain an
ascendancy where there is no occupation for the mind

the mission of san fernando was founded about the end of the 17th
century near the junction of the small rivers of the manzanares
and lucasperez a fire which consumed the church and the huts of
the indians induced the capuchins to build the village in its
present fine situation the number of families is increased to one
hundred and the missionary observed to us that the custom of
marrying at thirteen or fourteen years of age contributes greatly
to this rapid increase of population he denied that old age was so
premature among the chaymas as is commonly believed in europe the
government of these indian parishes is very complicated they have
their governor their major-alguazils and their
militia-commanders all copper-coloured natives the company of
archers have their colours and perform their exercise with the bow
and arrow in shooting at a mark this is the national guard
(militia) of the country this military establishment under a
purely monastic system seemed to us very singular

on the night of the 5th of september and the following morning
there was a thick fog yet we were not more than a hundred toises
above the level of the sea i determined geometrically at the
moment of our departure the height of the great calcareous
mountain which rises at 800 toises distance to the south of san
fernando and forms a perpendicular cliff on the north side it is
only 215 toises higher than the great square but naked masses of
rock which here exhibit themselves in the midst of a thick
vegetation give it a very majestic aspect

the road from san fernando to cumana passes amidst small
plantations through an open and humid valley we forded a number
of rivulets in the shade the thermometer did not rise above 30
degrees but we were exposed to the direct rays of the sun because
the bamboos which skirted the road afforded but small shelter
and we suffered greatly from the heat we passed through the
village of arenas inhabited by indians of the same race as those
at san fernando but arenas is no longer a mission and the
natives governed by a regular priest* (* the four villages of
arenas macarapana mariguitar and aricagua founded by aragonese
capuchins are called doctrinas de encomienda) are better clothed
and more civilized their church is also distinguished in the
country by some rude paintings which adorn its walls a narrow
border encloses figures of armadilloes caymans jaguars and other
animals peculiar to the new world

in this village lives a labourer francisco lozano who presented a
highly curious physiological phenomenon this man has suckled a
child with his own milk the mother having fallen sick the father
to quiet the infant took it into his bed and pressed it to his
bosom lozano then thirty-two years of age had never before
remarked that he had milk but the irritation of the nipple sucked
by the child caused the accumulation of that liquid the milk was
thick and very sweet the father astonished at the increased size
of his breast suckled his child two or three times a day during
five months he drew on himself the attention of his neighbours
but he never thought as he probably would have done in europe of
deriving any advantage from the curiosity he excited we saw the
certificate which had been drawn up on the spot to attest this
remarkable fact eye-witnesses of which are still living they
assured us that during this suckling the child had no other
nourishment than the milk of his father lozano who was not at
arenas during our journey in the missions came to us at cumana he
was accompanied by his son then thirteen or fourteen years of age
m bonpland examined with attention the father's breasts and found
them wrinkled like those of a woman who has given suck he observed
that the left breast in particular was much enlarged which lozano
explained to us from the circumstance that the two breasts did not
furnish milk in the same abundance don vicente emparan governor
of the province sent a circumstantial account of this phenomenon
to cadiz

it is not a very uncommon circumstance to find among animals
males whose breasts contain milk and climate does not appear to
exercise any marked influence on the greater or less abundance of
this secretion the ancients cite the milk of the he-goats of
lemnos and corsica in our own time we have seen in hanover a
he-goat which for a great number of years was milked every other
day and yielded more milk than a female goat among the signs of
the alleged weakness of the americans travellers have mentioned
the milk contained in the breasts of men it is however
improbable that it has ever been observed in a whole tribe in
some part of america unknown to modern travellers and i can affirm
that at present it is not more common in the new continent than in
the old the labourer of arenas whose case has just been
mentioned was not of the copper-coloured race of chayma indians
but was a white man descended from europeans moreover the
anatomists of st petersburgh have observed that among the lower
orders of the people in russia milk in the breasts of men is much
more frequent than among the more southern nations yet the
russians have never been deemed weak and effeminate there is among
the varieties of the human species a race of men whose breasts at
the age of puberty acquire a considerable bulk lozano did not
belong to that race and he often repeated to us his conviction
that it was only the irritation of the nipple in consequence of
the suction which caused the flow of milk

when we reflect on the whole of the vital phenomena we find that
no one of them is entirely isolated in every age examples are
cited of very young girls and women in extreme old age who have
suckled children among men these examples are more rare and after
numerous researches i have not found above two or three one is
cited by the anatomist of verona alexander benedictus who lived
about the end of the fifteenth century he relates the history of
an inhabitant of syria who to calm the fretfulness of his child
after the death of the mother pressed it to his bosom the milk
soon became so abundant that the father could take on himself the
nourishment of his child without assistance other examples are
related by santorellus faria and robert bishop of cork the
greater part of these phenomena having been noticed in times very
remote it is not uninteresting to physiology that we can confirm
them in our own days

on approaching the town of cumanacoa we found a more level soil
and a valley enlarging itself progressively this small town is
situated in a naked plain almost circular and surrounded by lofty
mountains it was founded in 1717 by domingo arias on the return
of an expedition to the mouth of the guarapiche undertaken with
the view of destroying an establishment which some french
freebooters had attempted to found the new town was first called
san baltazar de las arias but the indian name cumanacoa prevailed
in like manner the name of santiago de leon still to be found in
our maps is forgotten in that of caracas

on opening the barometer we were struck at seeing the column of
mercury scarcely 73 lines shorter than on the coasts the plain
or rather the table-land on which the town of cumanacoa is
situated is not more than 104 toises above the level of the sea
which is three or four times less than is supposed by the
inhabitants of cumana on account of their exaggerated ideas of the
cold of cumanacoa but the difference of climate observable between
places so near each other is perhaps less owing to comparative
height than to local circumstances among these causes we may cite
the proximity of the forests the frequency of descending currents
so common in these valleys closed on every side the abundance of
rain and those thick fogs which diminish during a great part of
the year the direct action of the solar rays the decrement of the
heat being nearly the same within the tropics and during the
summer under the temperate zone the small difference of level of
one hundred toises should produce only a change in the mean
temperature of 1 or 15 degrees but we shall soon find that at
cumanacoa the difference rises to more than four degrees this
coolness of the climate is sometimes the more surprising as very
great heat is felt at carthago (in the province of popayan) at
tomependa on the bank of the river amazon and in the valleys of
aragua to the west of caracas though the absolute height of these
different places is between 200 and 480 toises in plains as well
as on mountains the isothermal lines (lines of similar heat) are
not constantly parallel to the equator or the surface of the
globe it is the grand problem of meteorology to determine the
inflections of these lines and to discover amid modifications
produced by local causes the constant laws of the distribution of
heat

the port of cumana is only seven nautical leagues from cumanacoa
it scarcely ever rains in the first-mentioned place while in the
latter there are seven months of wintry weather at cumanacoa the
dry season begins at the winter solstice and lasts till the vernal
equinox light showers are frequent in the months of april may
and june the dry weather then returns again and lasts from the
summer solstice to the end of august then come the real winter
rains which cease only in the month of november and during which
torrents of water pour down from the skies

it was during the winter season that we took up our first abode in
the missions every night a thick fog covered the sky and it was
only at intervals that i succeeded in taking some observations of
the stars the thermometer kept from 185 to 20 degrees which
under this zone and to the sensations of a traveller coming from
the coasts appears a great degree of coolness i never perceived
the temperature in the night at cumana below 21 degrees the
greatest heat is felt from noon to 3 o'clock the thermometer
keeping between 26 and 27 degrees the maximum of the heat about
two hours after the passage of the sun over the meridian was very
regularly marked by a storm which murmured near large black and
low clouds dissolved in rain which came down in torrents these
rains lasted two or three hours and lowered the thermometer five
or six degrees about five o'clock the rain entirely ceased the
sun reappeared a little before it set and the hygrometer moved
towards the point of dryness but at eight or nine we were again
enveloped in a thick stratum of vapour these different changes
follow successively we were assured during whole months and yet
not a breath of wind is felt comparative experiments led us to
believe that in general the nights at cumanacoa are from two to
three and the days from four to five centesimal degrees cooler
than at the port of cumana these differences are great and if
instead of meteorological instruments we consulted only our own
feelings we should suppose they were still more considerable

the vegetation of the plain which surrounds the town is monotonous
but owing to the extreme humidity of the air remarkable for its
freshness it is chiefly characterized by an arborescent solanum
forty feet in height the urtica baccifera and a new species of
the genus guettarda* (* these trees are surrounded by galega
pilosa stellaria rotundifolia aegiphila elata of swartz
sauvagesia erecta martinia perennis and a great number of
rivinas we find among the gramineous plants in the savannah of
cumanacoa the paspalus lenticularis panicum ascendens pennisetum
uniflorum gynerium saccharoides eleusine indica etc) the ground
is very fertile and might be easily watered if trenches were cut
from a great number of rivulets the springs of which never dry up
during the whole year the most valuable production of the district
is tobacco since the introduction of the farm* (* estanco real de
tabaco royal monopoly of tobacco) in 1779 the cultivation of
tobacco in the province of cumana is nearly confined to the valley
of cumanacoa as in mexico it is permitted only in the two
districts of orizaba and cordova the farm system is a monopoly
odious to the people all the tobacco that is gathered must be sold
to government and to prevent or rather to diminish fraud it has
been found most easy to concentrate the cultivation in one point
guards scour the country to destroy any plantations without the
boundaries of the privileged districts and to inform against those
inhabitants who smoke cigars prepared by their own hands

next to the tobacco of the island of cuba and of the rio negro
that of cumana is the most aromatic it excels all the tobacco of
new spain and of the province of varinas we shall give some
particulars of its culture which essentially differs from the
method practised in virginia the prodigious expansion which is
remarked in the solaneous plants of the valley of cumanacoa
especially in the abundant species of the solanum arborescens of
aquartia and of cestrum seems to indicate the favourable nature
of this spot for plantations of tobacco the seed is sown in the
open ground at the beginning of september though sometimes not
till the month of december which period is however less favourable
for the harvest the cotyledons appear on the eighth day and the
young plants are covered with large leaves of heliconia and
plantain and shelter them from the direct action of the sun great
care also is taken to destroy weeds which between the tropics
spring up with astonishing rapidity the tobacco is transplanted
into a rich and well-prepared soil a month or two after it has
risen from the seed the plants are disposed in regular rows three
or four feet distant from each other care is taken to weed them
often and the principal stalk is several times topped till
greenish blue spots indicate to the cultivator the maturity of the
leaves they begin to gather them in the fourth month and this
first gathering generally terminates in the space of a few days it
would be better if the leaves were plucked only as they dry in
good years the cultivators cut the plant when it is only four feet
high and the shoot which springs from the root throws out new
leaves with such rapidity that they may be gathered on the
thirteenth or fourteenth day these last have the cellular tissue
very much extended and they contain more water more albumen and
less of that acrid volatile principle which is but little soluble
in water and in which the stimulant property of tobacco seems to
reside

at cumanacoa the tobacco after being gathered undergoes a
preparation which the spaniards call cura seca the leaves are
suspended by threads of cocuiza* (* agave americana) their ribs
are taken out and they are twisted into cords the prepared
tobacco should be carried to the king's warehouses in the month of
june but the indolence of the inhabitants and the preference they
give to the cultivation of maize and cassava usually prevent them
from finishing the preparation before the month of august it is
easy to conceive that the leaves so long exposed to very moist
air must lose some of their flavour the administrator of the farm
keeps the tobacco deposited in the king's warehouses sixty days
without touching it when this time is expired the manoques are
opened to examine the quality if the administrator find the
tobacco well prepared he pays the cultivator three piastres for
the aroba of twenty-five pounds weight the same quantity is resold
for the king's profit at twelve piastres and a half the tobacco
that is rotten (podrido) that is again gone into a state of
fermentation is publicly burnt and the cultivator who has
received money in advance from the royal farm loses irrevocably
the fruits of his long labour we saw heaps amounting to five
hundred arobas burnt in the great square which in europe might
have served for making snuff

the soil of cumanacoa is so favourable to this branch of culture
that tobacco grows wild wherever the seed finds any moisture it
grows thus spontaneously at cerro del cuchivano and around the
cavern of caripe the only kind of tobacco cultivated at cumanacoa
as well as in the neighbouring districts of aricagua and san
lorenzo is that with large sessile leaves* (* nicotiana tabacum)
called virginia tobacco the tobacco with petiolate leaves* (*
nicotiana rustica) which is the yetl of the ancient mexicans is
unknown

in studying the history of our cultivated plants we are surprised
to find that before the conquest the use of tobacco was spread
through the greater part of america while the potato was unknown
both in mexico and the west india islands where it grows well in
the mountainous regions tobacco has also been cultivated in
portugal since the year 1559 though the potato did not become an
object of european agriculture till the end of the seventeenth and
beginning of the eighteenth century this latter plant which has
had so powerful an influence on the well-being of society has
spread in both continents more slowly than tobacco which can be
considered only as an article of luxury

next to tobacco the most important culture of the valley of
cumanacoa is that of indigo the manufacturers of cumanacoa of san
fernando and of arenas produce indigo of greater commercial value
than that of caracas and often nearly equalling in splendour and
richness of colour the indigo of guatimala it was from that
province that the coasts of cumana received the first seeds of the
indigofera anil* which is cultivated jointly with the indigofera
tinctoria (* the indigo known in commerce is produced by four
species of plants the indigofera tinctoria i anil i argentea
and i disperma at the rio negro near the frontiers of brazil we
found the i argentea growing wild but only in places anciently
inhabited by indians) the rains being very frequent in the valley
of cumanacoa a plant of four feet high yields no more colouring
matter than one of a third part that size in the arid valleys of
aragua to the west of the town of caracas

the manufactories we examined are all built on uniform principles
two steeping vessels or vats which receive the plants intended to
be brought into a state of fermentation are joined together each
vat is fifteen feet square and two and a half deep from these
upper vats the liquor runs into beaters between which is placed
the water-mill the axletree of the great wheel crosses the two
beaters it is furnished with ladles fixed to long handles
adapted for the beating from a spacious settling-vat the
colouring fecula is carried to the drying place and spread on
planks of brasiletto which having small wheels can be sheltered
under a roof in case of sudden rains sloping and very low roofs
give the drying place the appearance of hot-houses at some
distance in the valley of cumanacoa the fermentation of the plant
is produced with astonishing rapidity it lasts in general but four
or five hours this short duration can be attributed only to the
humidity of the climate and the absence of the sun during the
development of the plant i think i have observed in the course of
my travels that the drier the climate the slower the vat works
and the greater the quantity of indigo at the minimum of
oxidation contained in the stalks in the province of caracas
where 562 cubic feet of the plant slightly piled up yield
thirty-five or forty pounds of dry indigo the liquid does not pass
into the beater till after twenty thirty or thirty-five hours it
is probable that the inhabitants of cumanacoa would extract more
colouring matter if they left the plants longer steeping in the
first vat* (* the planters are pretty generally of opinion that
the fermentation should never continue less than ten hours
beauvais-raseau art de l'indigotier page 81) during my abode at
cumana i made solutions of the indigo of cumanacoa which is
somewhat heavy and coppery and that of caracas in sulphuric acid
in order to compare them and the solution of the former appeared
to me to be of a much more intense blue

the plain of cumanacoa spotted with farms and small plantations of
indigo and tobacco is surrounded with mountains which towards the
south rise to considerable height everything indicates that the
valley is the bottom of an ancient lake the mountains which in
ancient times formed its shores all rise perpendicularly in the
direction of the plain the only outlet for the waters of the lake
was on the side of arenas in digging foundations beds of round
pebbles mixed with small bivalve shells are found and according
to the report of persons worthy of credit there were discovered
thirty years ago at the bottom of the ravine of san juanillo two
enormous femoral bones four feet long and weighing more than
thirty pounds the indians imagined that these were giants' bones
whilst the half-learned sages of the country who assume the right
of explaining everything gravely asserted that they were mere
sports of nature and little worthy of attention an opinion
founded on the circumstance that human bones decay rapidly in the
soil of cumanacoa in order to decorate their churches on the
festival of the dead they take skulls from the cemeteries on the
coast where the earth is impregnated with saline substances these
pretended thigh-bones of giants were carried to the port of cumana
where i sought for them in vain but from the analogy of some
fossil bones which i brought from other parts of south america and
which have been carefully examined by m cuvier it is probable
that the gigantic femoral bones of cumanacoa belonged to elephants
of a species now extinct it may appear surprising that they were
found in a place so little elevated above the present level of the
waters since it is a remarkable fact that the fragments of the
mastodons and fossil elephants which i brought from the equinoctial
regions of mexico new grenada quito and peru were not found in
low regions (as were the megatherium of rio luxan* (* one league
south-east from the town of buenos ayres) and virginia* (* the
megatherium of virginia is the megalonyx of mr jefferson all the
enormous remains found in the plains of the new continent either
north or south of the equator belong not to the torrid but to
the temperate zone on the other hand pallas observes that in
siberia consequently also northward of the tropics fossil bones
are never found in mountainous parts these facts intimately
connected together seem calculated to lead to the discovery of a
great geological law) the great mastodons of the ohio and the
fossil elephants of the susquehanna in the temperate zone) but on
table-lands having from six to fourteen hundred toises of
elevation

as we approached the southern bank of the basin of cumanacoa we
enjoyed the view of the turimiquiri* (* some of the inhabitants
pronounce this name tumuriquiri others turumiquiri or
tumiriquiri during the whole time of our stay at cumanacoa the
summit of this mountain was covered with clouds it appeared
uncovered on the evening of the 11th of september but only for a
few minutes the angle of elevation taken from the great square of
cumanacoa was 8 degrees 2 minutes this determination and the
barometrical measurement which i made on the 13th may enable us to
fix within a certain approximation the distance of the mountain
at six miles and a third or 6050 toises admitting that the part
uncovered by clouds was 850 toises above the plain of cumanacoa)
an enormous wall of rocks the remains of an ancient cliff rises
in the midst of the forests farther to the west at cerro del
cuchivano the chain of mountains seems as if broken by the effects
of an earthquake the crevice is more than a hundred and fifty
toises wide is surrounded by perpendicular rocks and is filled
with trees the interwoven branches of which find no room to
spread this cleft appears like a mine opened by the falling in of
the earth it is intersected by a torrent the rio juagua and its
appearance is highly picturesque it is called risco del cuchivano
the river rises at the distance of seven leagues south-west at the
foot of the mountain of the brigantine and it forms some beautiful
cascades before it spreads through the plain of cumanacoa

we visited several times a small farm the conuco of bermudez
opposite the risco del cuchivano where tobacco plantains and
several species of cotton-trees* are cultivated in the moist soil
(* gossypium uniglandulosum improperly called herbaceum and g
barbadense) especially that tree the cotton of which is of a
nankeen colour and which is so common in the island of margareta*
(* g religiosum) the proprietor of the farm told us that the
risco or crevice was inhabited by jaguar tigers these animals pass
the day in caverns and roam around human habitations at night
being well fed they grow to the length of six feet one of them
had devoured in the preceding year a horse belonging to the farm
he dragged his prey on a fine moonlight night across the savannah
to the foot of a ceiba* of an enormous size (* bombax ceiba
five-leaved silk-cotton tree) the groans of the dying horse awoke
the slaves of the farm who went out armed with lances and
machetes* (* great knives with very long blades like a couteau
de chasse no one enters the woods in the torrid zone without being
armed with a machete not only to cut his way through the woods
but as a defence against wild beasts) the tiger crouching over
his prey awaited their approach with tranquillity and fell only
after a long and obstinate resistance this fact and many others
verified on the spot prove that the great jaguar* of terra firma
(* felis onca linn which buffon called panthere oillee and
which he believed came from africa) like the jaguarete of
paraguay and the real tiger of asia does not flee from man when
it is dared to close combat and when not intimidated by the number
of its assailants naturalists at present admit that buffon was
entirely mistaken with respect to the greatest of the feline race
of america what buffon says of the cowardice of tigers of the new
continent relates to the small ocelots* (* felis pardalis linn
or the chibiguazu of azara different from the tlateo-ocelotl or
tiger-cat of the aztecs) at the orinoco the real jaguar of
america sometimes leaps into the water to attack the indians in
their canoes

opposite the farm of bermudez two spacious caverns open into the
crevice of cuchivano whence at times there issue flames which may
be seen at a great distance in the night and judging by the
elevation of the rocks above which these fiery exhalations ascend
we should be led to think that they rise several hundred feet this
phenomenon was accompanied by a subterranean dull and long
continued noise at the time of the last great earthquake of
cumana it is observed chiefly during the rainy season and the
owners of the farms opposite the mountain of cuchivano allege that
the flames have become more frequent since december 1797

in a herborizing excursion we made at rinconada we attempted to
penetrate into the crevice wishing to examine the rocks which
seemed to contain in their bosom the cause of these extraordinary
conflagrations but the strength of the vegetation the
interweaving of the lianas and thorny plants hindered our
progress happily the inhabitants of the valley themselves felt a
warm interest in our researches less from the fear of a volcanic
explosion than because their minds were impressed with the idea
that the risco del cuchivano contained a gold mine and although we
expressed our doubts of the existence of gold in a secondary
limestone they insisted on knowing "what the german miner thought
of the richness of the vein" ever since the time of charles v and
the government of the welsers the alfingers and the sailers at
coro and caracas the people of terra firma have entertained a
great confidence in the germans with respect to all that relates to
the working of mines wherever i went in south america when the
place of my birth was known i was shown samples of ore in these
colonies every frenchman is supposed to be a physician and every
german a miner

the farmers with the aid of their slaves opened a path across the
woods to the first fall of the rio juagua and on the 10th of
september we made our excursion to the cuchivano on entering the
crevice we recognised the proximity of tigers by a porcupine
recently emboweled for greater security the indians returned to
the farm and brought back some dogs of a very small breed we were
assured that in the event of our meeting a jaguar in a narrow path
he would spring on the dog rather than on a man we did not proceed
along the brink of the torrent but on the slope of the rocks which
overhung the water we walked on the side of a precipice from two
to three hundred feet deep on a kind of very narrow cornice like
the road which leads from the grindelwald along the mettenberg to
the great glacier when the cornice was so narrow that we could
find no place for our feet we descended into the torrent crossed
it by fording and then climbed the opposite wall these descents
are very fatiguing and it is not safe to trust to the lianas
which hang like great cords from the tops of the trees the
creeping and parasite plants cling but feebly to the branches which
they embrace the united weight of their stalks is considerable
and you run the risk of pulling down a whole mass of verdure if
in walking on a sloping ground you support your weight by the
lianas the farther we advanced the thicker the vegetation became
in several places the roots of the trees had burst the calcareous
rock by inserting themselves into the clefts that separate the
beds we had some trouble to carry the plants which we gathered at
every step the cannas the heliconias with fine purple flowers
the costuses and other plants of the amomum family here attain
eight or ten feet in height and their fresh tender verdure their
silky gloss and the extraordinary development of the parenchyma
form a striking contrast with the brown colour of the arborescent
ferns the foliage of which is delicately shaped the indians made
incisions with their large knives in the trunks of the trees and
fixed our attention on those beautiful red and gold-coloured woods
which will one day be sought for by our turners and cabinet-makers
they showed us a plant of the compositae order twenty feet high
(the eupatorium laevigatum of lamarck) the rose of belveria* (*
brownea racemosa) celebrated for the brilliancy of its purple
flowers and the dragon's-blood of this country which is a kind of
croton not yet described* (* plants of families entirely different
are called in the spanish colonies of both continents sangre de
draco they are dracaenas pterocarpi and crotons father caulin
descrip corografica page 25 in speaking of resins found in the
forests of cumana makes a just distinction between the draco de la
sierra de unare which has pinnate leaves (pterocarpus draco) and
the draco de la sierra de paria with entire and hairy leaves the
latter is the croton sanguifluum of cumanacoa caripe and cariaco
) the red and astringent juice of this plant is employed to
strengthen the gums the indians recognize the species by the
smell and more particularly by chewing the woody fibres two
natives to whom the same wood was given to chew pronounced
without hesitation the same name we could avail ourselves but
little of the sagacity of our guides for how could we procure
leaves flowers and fruits growing on trunks the branches of
which commence at fifty or sixty feet high? we were struck at
finding in this hollow the bark of trees and even the soil
covered with moss* and lichens (* real musci frondosi we also
found besides a small boletus stipitatus of a snow-white colour
the boletus igniarius and the lycoperdon stellatum of europe i
had found this last only in very dry places in germany and poland)
the cryptogamous plants are here as common as in northern
countries their growth is favoured by the moisture of the air and
the absence of the direct rays of the sun nevertheless the
temperature is generally at 25 degrees in the day and 19 degrees
at night

the rocks which bound the crevice of cuchivano are perpendicular
like walls and are of the same calcareous formation which we
observed the whole way from punta delgada it is here a blackish
grey of compact fracture tending sometimes towards the sandy
fracture and crossed by small veins of white carbonated lime in
these characteristic marks we thought we discovered the alpine
limestone of switzerland and the tyrol of which the colour is
always deep though in a less degree than that of the transition
limestone* (* escher in the alpina volume 4 page 340) the first
of these formations constitutes the cuchivano the nucleus of the
imposible and in general the whole group of the mountains of new
andalusia i saw no petrifactions in it but the inhabitants assert
that considerable masses of shells are found at great heights the
same phenomenon occurs in the country about salzburg* (* in
switzerland the solitary beds of shells at the height of from
1300 to 2000 toises (in the jungfrauhorn the dent de morcle and
the dent du midi) belong to transition limestone) at the
cuchivano the alpine limestone contains beds of marly clay*
(*mergelschiefer) three or four toises thick and this geological
fact proves on the one hand the identity of the alpenkalkstein with
the zechstein of thuringia and on the other the affinity of
formation existing between the alpine limestone and that of the
jura* (* the jura and the alpine limestone are kindred formations
and they are sometimes difficult to be distinguished where they
lie immediately one upon another as in the apennines the alpine
limestone and the zechstein famous among the geologists of
freyberg are identical formations this identity which i noticed
in the year 1793 (uber die grubenwetter) is a geological fact the
more interesting as it seems to unite the northern european
formations to those of the central chain it is known that the
zechstein is situated between the muriatiferous gypsum and the
conglomerate (ancient sandstone) or where there is no
muriatiferous gypsum between the slaty sandstone with roestones
(buntesandstein wern) and the conglomerate or ancient sandstone
it contains strata of schistous and coppery marl (bituminoce mergel
and kupferschiefer) which form an important object in the working
of mines at mansfeld in saxony near riegelsdorf in hesse and at
hasel and prausnitz in silesia in the southern part of bavaria
(oberbaiern) i saw the alpine limestone containing these same
strata of schistous clay and marl which though thinner whiter
and especially more frequent characterize the limestone of jura
respecting the slates of blattenberg in the canton of glaris which
some mineralogists because of their numerous impressions of fish
have long mistaken for the cupreous slates of mansfeld they
belong according to m von buch to a real transition formation
all these geological data tend to prove that strata of marl more
or less mixed with carbon are to be found in the limestone of
jura in the alpine limestone and in the transition schists the
mixture of carbon sulphuretted iron and copper appears to me to
augment with the relative antiquity of the formations) the strata
of marl effervesce with acids though silex and alumina predominate
in them they are strongly impregnated with carbon and sometimes
blacken the hands like a real vitriolic schistus the supposed
gold mine of cuchivano which was the object of our examination is
nothing but an excavation cut into one of those black strata of
marl which contain pyrites in abundance the excavation is on the
right bank of the river juagua and must be approached with
caution because the torrent there is more than eight feet deep
the sulphurous pyrites are found some massive and others
crystallized and disseminated in the rock their colour of a very
clear golden yellow does not indicate that they contain copper
they are mixed with fibrous sulphuret of iron* (* haarkies) and
nodules of swinestone or fetid carbonate of lime the marly
stratum crosses the torrent and as the water washes out metallic
grains the people imagine on account of the brilliancy of the
pyrites that the torrent bears down gold it is reported that
after the great earthquake which took place in 1766 the waters of
the juagua were so charged with gold that "men who came from a
great distance and whose country was unknown" established
washing-places on the spot they disappeared during the night
after having collected a great quantity of gold it would be
needless to show that this is a fable pyrites dispersed in
quartzose veins crossing the mica-slate are often auriferous no
doubt but no analogous fact leads to the supposition that the
sulphuretted iron which is found in the schistose marls of the
alpine limestone contains gold some direct experiments made with
acids during my abode at caracas showed that the pyrites of
cuchivano are not auriferous our guides were amazed at my
incredulity in vain i repeated that alum and sulphate of iron only
could be obtained from this supposed gold mine they continued
picking up secretly every bit of pyrites they saw sparkling in the
water in countries possessing few mines the inhabitants entertain
exaggerated ideas respecting the facility with which riches are
drawn from the bowels of the earth how much time did we not lose
during five years' travels in visiting on the pressing
invitations of our hosts ravines of which the pyritous strata
have borne for ages the imposing names of 'minas de oro' how often
have we been grieved to see men of all classes magistrates
pastors of villages grave missionaries grinding with
inexhaustible patience amphibole or yellow mica in the hope of
extracting gold from it by means of mercury this rage for the
search of mines strikes us the more in a climate where the ground
needs only to be slightly raked to produce abundant harvests

after visiting the pyritous marls of the rio juagua we continued
following the course of the crevice which stretches along like a
narrow canal overshadowed by very lofty trees we observed strata
on the left bank opposite cerro del cuchivano singularly crooked
and twisted this phenomenon i had often admired at the ochsenberg
* in passing the lake of lucerne (* this mountain of switzerland
is composed of transition limestone we find these same inflexions
in the strata near bonneville at nante d'arpenas in savoy and in
the valley of estaubee in the pyrenees another transition rock
the grauwakke of the germans (very near the english killas)
exhibits the same phenomenon in scotland) the calcareous beds of
the cuchivano and the neighbouring mountains keep pretty regularly
the direction of north-north-east and south-south-west their
inclination is sometimes north and sometimes south most commonly
they seem to take a direction towards the valley of cumanacoa and
it cannot be doubted that the valley has an influence* on the
inclination of the strata (* the same observation may apply to the
lake of gemunden in styria which i visited with m von buch and
which is one of the most picturesque situations in europe)

we had suffered great fatigue and were quite drenched by
frequently crossing the torrent when we reached the caverns of the
cuchivano a wall of rock there rises perpendicularly to the height
of eight hundred toises it is seldom that in a zone where the
force of vegetation everywhere conceals the soil and the rocks we
behold a great mountain presenting naked strata in a perpendicular
section in the middle of this section and in a position
unfortunately inaccessible to man two caverns open in the form of
crevices we were assured that they are inhabited by nocturnal
birds the same as those we were soon to become acquainted with in
the cueva del guacharo of caripe near these caverns we saw strata
of schistose marl and found with great astonishment
rock-crystals encased in beds of alpine limestone they were
hexahedral prisms terminated with pyramids fourteen lines long
and eight thick the crystals perfectly transparent were
solitary and often three or four toises distant from each other
they were enclosed in the calcareous mass as the quartz crystals
of burgtonna* (* in the duchy of gotha) and the boracite of
lunebourg are contained in gypsum there was no crevice near or
any vestige of calcareous spar* (* this phenomenon reminds us of
another equally rare the quartz crystals found by m freiesleben
in saxony near burgorner in the county of mansfeld in the middle
of a rock of porous limestone (rauchwakke) lying immediately on
the alpine limestone the rock crystals which are pretty common in
the primitive limestone of carrara line the insides of cavities in
the rocks without being enveloped by the rock itself)

we reposed at the foot of the cavern whence those flames were seen
to issue which of late years have become more frequent our guides
and the farmer an intelligent man equally acquainted with the
localities of the province discussed in the manner of the
creoles the dangers to which the town of cumanacoa would be
exposed if the cuchivano became an active volcano or as they
expressed it "se veniesse a reventar" it appeared to them
evident that since the great earthquakes of quito and cumana in
1797 new andalusia was every day more and more undermined by
subterranean fires they cited the flames which had been seen to
issue from the earth at cumana and the shocks felt in places where
heretofore the ground had never been shaken they recollected that
at macarapan sulphurous emanations had been frequently perceived
for some months past we were struck with these facts upon which
were founded predictions that have since been almost all realized
enormous convulsions of the earth took place at caracas in 1812
and proved how tumultuously nature is agitated in the north-east
part of terra firma

but what is the cause of the luminous phenomena which are observed
in the cuchivano? the column of air which rises from the mouth of a
burning volcano* is sometimes observed to shine with a splendid
light (* we must not confound this very rare phenomenon with the
glimmering commonly observed a few toises above the brink of a
crater and which (as i remarked at mount vesuvius in 1805) is only
the reflection of great masses of inflamed scoria thrown up
without sufficient force to pass the mouth of the volcano) this
light which is believed to be owing to the hydrogen gas was
observed from chillo on the summit of the cotopaxi at a time when
the mountain seemed in the greatest repose according to the
statements of the ancients the mons albanus near rome known at
present under the name of monte cavo appeared at times on fire
during the night but the mons albanus is a volcano recently
extinguished which in the time of cato threw out rapilli* (*
"albano monte biduum continenter lapidibus pluit" livy lib 25
cap 7 (heyne opuscula acad tome 3 page 261)) while the
cuchivano is a calcareous mountain remote from any trap formation
can these flames be attributed to the decomposition of water
entering into contact with the pyrites dispersed through the
schistose marl? or is it inflamed hydrogen that issues from the
cavern of cuchivano? the marls as the smell indicates are
pyritous and bituminous at the same time and the petroleum springs
at the buen pastor and in the island of trinidad proceed probably
from these same beds of alpine limestone it would be easy to
suppose some connexion between the waters filtering through this
calcareous stone and decomposed by pyrites and the earthquakes of
cumana the springs of sulphuretted hydrogen in new barcelona the
beds of native sulphur at carupano and the emanations of
sulphurous acid which are perceived at times in the savannahs it
cannot be doubted also that the decomposition of water by the
pyrites at an elevated temperature favoured by the affinity of
oxidated iron for earthy substances may have caused that
disengagement of hydrogen gas to the action of which several
modern geologists have attributed so much importance but in
general sulphurous acid is perceived more commonly than hydrogen
in the eruption of volcanoes and the odour of that acid
principally prevails while the earth is agitated by violent shocks
when we take a general view of the phenomena of volcanoes and
earthquakes when we recollect the enormous distance at which the
commotion is propagated below the basin of the sea we readily
discard explanations founded on small strata of pyrites and
bituminous marls i am of opinion that the shocks so frequently
felt in the province of cumana are as little to be attributed to
the rocks above the surface of the earth as those which agitate
the apennines are assignable to asphaltic veins or springs of
burning petroleum the whole of these phenomena depend on more
general i would almost say on deeper causes and it is not in the
secondary strata which form the exterior crust of our globe but in
the primitive rocks at an enormous distance from the soil that we
should seek the focus of volcanic action the greater progress we
make in geology the more we feel the insufficiency of theories
founded on observations merely local

on the 12th of september we continued our journey to the convent of
caripe the principal settlement of the chayma missions we chose
instead of the direct road that by the mountains of the
cocollar* (* is this name of indian origin? at cumana i heard
it derived in a manner somewhat far-fetched from the spanish word
cogollo signifying the heart of oleraceous plants the cocollar
forms the centre of the whole group of the mountains of new
andalusia) and the turimiquiri the height of which little exceeds
that of jura the road first runs eastward crossing over the length
of three leagues the table-land of cumanacoa in a soil formerly
levelled by the waters it then turns to the south we passed the
little indian village of aricagua surrounded by woody hills thence
we began to ascend and the ascent lasted more than four hours we
crossed two-and-twenty times the river of pututucuar a rapid
torrent full of blocks of calcareous rock when on the cuesta del
cocollar we reached an elevation two thousand feet above the level
of the sea we were surprised to find scarcely any forests or great
trees we passed over an immense plain covered with gramineous
plants mimosas with hemispheric tops and stems only four or five
feet high alone vary the dull uniformity of the savannahs their
branches are bent towards the ground or spread out like umbrellas
wherever there are deep declivities or masses of rocks half
covered with mould the clusia or cupey with great nymphaea
flowers displays its beautiful verdure the roots of this tree are
eight inches in diameter and they sometimes shoot out from the
trunk at the height of fifteen feet above the soil

after having climbed the mountain for a considerable time we
reached a small plain at the hato del cocollar this is a solitary
farm situated on a table-land 408 toises high we rested three
days in this retreat where we were treated with great kindness by
the proprietor don mathias yturburi a native of biscay who had
accompanied us from the port of cumana we there found milk
excellent meat from the richness of the pasture and above all a
delightful climate during the day the centigrade thermometer did
not rise above 22 or 23 degrees a little before sunset it fell to
19 and at night it scarcely kept up to 14 degrees* (* 112
degrees reaum) the nightly temperature was consequently seven
degrees colder than that of the coasts which is a fresh proof of
an extremely rapid decrement of heat the table-land of cocollar
being less elevated than the site of the town of caracas

as far as the eye could reach we perceived from this elevated
point only naked savannahs small tufts of scattered trees rise in
the ravines and notwithstanding the apparent uniformity of
vegetation great numbers of curious plants* are found here (*
cassia acuta andromeda rigida casearia hypericifolia myrtus
longifolia buettneria salicifolia glycine picta g pratensis g
gibba oxalis umbrosa malpighia caripensis cephaelis salicifolia
stylosanthes angustifolia salvia pseudococcinea eryngium
foetidum we found a second time this last plant but at a
considerable height in the great forests of bark trees surrounding
the town of loxa in the centre of the cordilleras) we shall only
speak of a superb lobelia* with purple flowers (* lobelia
spectabilis) the brownea coccinea which is upwards of a hundred
feet high and above all the pejoa celebrated in the country on
account of the delightful and aromatic perfume emitted by its
leaves when rubbed between the fingers* (* it is the gualtheria
odorata the pejoa is found round the lake of cocollar which gives
birth to the great river guarapiche we met with the same shrub at
the cuchilla de guanaguana it is a subalpine plant which forms at
the silla de caracas a zone much higher than in the province of
cumana the leaves of the pejoa have even a more agreeable smell
than those of the myrtus pimenta but they yield no perfume when
rubbed a few hours after their separation from the tree) but the
great charms of this solitary place were the beauty and serenity of
the nights the proprietor of the farm who spent his evenings with
us seemed to enjoy the astonishment produced on europeans newly
transplanted to the tropics by that vernal freshness of the air
which is felt on the mountains after sunset in those distant
regions where men yet feel the full value of the gifts of nature
a land-holder boasts of the water of his spring the absence of
noxious insects the salutary breeze that blows round his hill as
we in europe descant on the conveniences of our dwellings and the
picturesque effect of our plantations

our host had visited the new world with an expedition which was to
form establishments for felling wood for the spanish navy on the
shores of the gulf of paria in the vast forests of mahogany
cedar and brazil-wood which border the caribbean sea it was
proposed to select the trunks of the largest trees giving them in
a rough way the shape adapted to the building of ships and sending
them every year to the dockyard near cadiz white men unaccustomed
to the climate could not support the fatigue of labour the heat
and the effect of the noxious air exhaled by the forests the same
winds which are loaded with the perfume of flowers leaves and
woods infuse also as we may say the germs of dissolution into
the vital organs destructive fevers carried off not only the
ship-carpenters but the persons who had the management of the
establishment and this bay which the early spaniards named golfo
triste (melancholy bay) on account of the gloomy and wild aspect
of its coasts became the grave of european seamen our host had
the rare good fortune to escape these dangers after having
witnessed the death of a great number of his friends he withdrew
from the coast to the mountains of cocollar

nothing can be compared to the majestic tranquillity which the
aspect of the firmament presents in this solitary region when
tracing with the eye at night-fall the meadows which bounded the
horizon the plain covered with verdure and gently undulated we
thought we beheld from afar as in the deserts of the orinoco the
surface of the ocean supporting the starry vault of heaven the
tree under which we were seated the luminous insects flying in the
air the constellations which shone in the south every object
seemed to tell us how far we were from our native land if amidst
this exotic nature we heard from the depth of the valley the
tinkling of a bell or the lowing of herds the remembrance of our
country was awakened suddenly the sounds were like distant voices
resounding from beyond the ocean and with magical power
transporting us from one hemisphere to the other strange mobility
of the imagination of man eternal source of our enjoyments and our
pains

we began in the cool of the morning to climb the turimiquiri this
is the name given to the summit of the cocollar which with the
brigantine forms one single mass of mountain formerly called by
the natives the sierra de los tageres we travelled along a part of
the road on horses which roam about these savannahs but some of
them are used to the saddle though their appearance is very heavy
they pass lightly over the most slippery turf we first stopped at
a spring issuing not from the calcareous rock but from a layer of
quartzose sandstone the temperature was 21 degrees consequently
15 degrees less than the spring of quetepe and the difference of
the level is nearly 220 toises wherever the sandstone appears
above ground the soil is level and constitutes as it were small
platforms succeeding each other like steps to the height of 700
toises and even beyond this mountain like those in its vicinity
is covered only with gramineous plants* (* the most abundant
species are the paspalus the andropogon fastigiatum which forms
the genus diectomis of m palissot de beauvais and the panicum
olyroides) the absence of trees is attributed at cumana to the
great elevation of the ground but a slight reflection on the
distribution of plants in the cordilleras of the torrid zone will
lead us to conceive that the summits of new andalusia are very far
from reaching the superior limit of the trees which in this
latitude is at least 1800 toises of absolute height the smooth
turf of the cocollar begins to appear at 350 toises above the level
of the sea and the traveller may contrive to walk upon this turf
till he reaches a thousand toises in height farther on beyond
this band covered with gramineous plants we found amidst peaks
almost inaccessible to man a small forest of cedrela javillo* (*
huras crepitans of the family of the euphorbias the growth of its
trunk is so enormous that m bonpland measured vats of javillo
wood 14 feet long and 8 wide these vats made from one log of
wood are employed to keep the guarapo or juice of the sugar-cane
and the molasses the seeds of javillo are a very active poison
and the milk that issues from the petioles when broken frequently
produced inflammation in our eyes if by chance the least quantity
penetrated under the eyelids) and mahogany these local
circumstances induce me to think that the mountainous savannahs of
the cocollar and turimiquiri owe their existence only to the
destructive custom practised by the natives of setting fire to the
woods when they want to convert the soil into pasturage where
during the lapse of three centuries grasses and alpine plants have
covered the soil with a thick carpet the seeds of trees can no
longer germinate and fix themselves in the earth though birds and
winds convey them continually from the distant forests into the
savannahs

the climate of these mountains is so mild that at the farm of the
cocollar the cotton and coffee tree and even the sugar cane are
cultivated with success whatever the inhabitants of the coasts may
allege hoar-frost has never been found in the latitude of 10
degrees on heights scarcely exceeding those of the mont d'or or
the puy-de-dome the pastures of turimiquiri become less rich in
proportion to the elevation wherever scattered rocks afford shade
lichens and some european mosses are found the melastoma guacito*
(* melastoma xanthostachys called guacito at caracas) and a
shrub the large and tough leaves of which rustle like parchment*
when shaken by the winds (* palicourea rigida chaparro bovo in
the savannahs or llanos the same castilian name is given to a
tree of the family of the proteaceae) rise here and there in the
savannah but the principal ornament of the turf of these mountains
is a liliaceous plant with golden flowers the marica
martinicensis it is generally observed in the province of cumana
and caracas only at 400 or 500 toises of elevation* (* for
example in the montana de avila on the road from caracas to la
guayra and in the silla de caracas the seeds of the marica are
ripe at the end of december) the whole rocky mass of the
turimiquiri is composed of an alpine limestone like that of
cumanacoa and a pretty thin strata of marl and quartzose
sandstone the limestone contains masses of brown oxidated iron and
carbonate of iron i have observed in several places and very
distinctly that the sandstone not only reposes on the limestone
but that this last rock frequently includes and alternates with the
sandstone

we distinguished clearly the round summit of the turimiquiri and
the lofty peaks or as they are called the cucuruchos covered
with thick vegetation and infested by tigers which are hunted for
the beauty of their skin this round summit which is covered with
turf is 707 toises above the level of the ocean a ridge of steep
rocks stretches out westward and is broken at the distance of a
mile by an enormous crevice that descends toward the gulf of
cariaco at the point which might be supposed to be the
continuation of the ridge two calcareous paps or peaks arise the
most northern of which is the loftiest it is this last which is
more particularly called the cucurucho de turimiquiri and which is
considered to be higher than the mountain of the brigantine so
well known by the sailors who frequent the coasts of cumana we
measured by angles of elevation and a basis rather short traced
on the round summit the peak of cucurucho which was about 350
toises higher than our station so that its absolute height
exceeded 1050 toises

the view we enjoyed on the turimiquiri is of vast extent and
highly picturesque from the summer to the ocean we perceived
chains of mountains extended in parallel lines from east to west
and bounding longitudinal valleys these valleys are intersected at
right angles by an infinite number of small ravines scooped out by
the torrents the consequence is that the lateral ranges are
transformed into so many rows of paps some round and others
pyramidal the ground in general is a gentle slope as far as the
imposible farther on the precipices become bold and continue so
to the shore of the gulf of cariaco the form of this mass of
mountains reminded us of the chain of the jura and the only plain
that presents itself is the valley of cumanacoa we seemed to look
down into the bottom of a funnel in which we could distinguish
amidst tufts of scattered trees the indian village of aricagua
towards the north a narrow slip of land the peninsula of araya
formed a dark stripe on the sea which being illumined by the rays
of the sun reflected a strong light beyond the peninsula the
horizon was bounded by cape macanao the black rocks of which rise
amid the waters like an immense bastion

the farm of the cocollar situated at the foot of the turimiquiri
is in latitude 19 degrees 9 minutes 32 seconds i found the dip of
the needle 421 degrees the needle oscillates 229 times in ten
minutes possibly masses of brown iron-ore included in the
calcareous rock caused a slight augmentation in the intensity of
the magnetic forces

on the 14th of september we descended the cocollar toward the
mission of san antonio after crossing several savannahs strewed
with large blocks of calcareous stone we entered a thick forest
having passed two ridges of extremely steep mountains* (* these
ridges which are rather difficult to climb towards the end of the
rainy season are distinguished by the names of los yepes and
fantasma) we discovered a fine valley five or six leagues in
length pretty uniformly following the direction of east and west
in this valley are situated the missions of san antonio and
guanaguana the first is famous on account of a small church with
two towers built of brick in pretty good style and ornamented
with columns of the doric order it is the wonder of the country
the prefect of the capuchins completed the building of this church
in less than two summers though he employed only the indians of
his village the mouldings of the capitals the cornices and a
frieze decorated with suns and arabesques are executed in clay
mixed with pounded brick if we are surprised to find churches in
the purest grecian style on the confines of lapland* (* at
skelefter near torneo buch voyage en norwege) we are still
more struck with these first essays of art in a region where
everything indicates the wild state of man and where the basis of
civilization has not been laid by europeans more than forty years

i stopped at the mission of san antonio only to open the barometer
and to take a few altitudes of the sun the elevation of the great
square above cumana is 216 toises after having crossed the
village we forded the rivers colorado and guarapiche both of
which rise in the mountains of the cocollar and blend their waters
lower down towards the east the colorado has a very rapid current
and becomes at its mouth broader than the rhine the guarapiche at
its junction with the rio areo is more than twenty-five fathoms
deep its banks are ornamented by a superb gramen of which i made
a drawing two years afterward on ascending the river magdalena the
distich-leaved stalk of this gramen often reaches the height of
fifteen or twenty feet* (* lata or cana brava it is a new genus
between aira and arundo this colossal gramen looks like the donax
of italy this the arundinaria of the mississippi (ludolfia
willd miegia of persoon) and the bamboos are the highest
gramens of the new continent its seed has been carried to st
domingo where its stalk is employed to thatch the negroes' huts)

towards evening we reached the mission of guanaguana the site of
which is almost on a level with the village of san antonio the
missionary received us cordially he was an old man and he seemed
to govern his indians with great intelligence the village has
existed only thirty years on the spot it now occupies before that
time it was more to the south and was backed by a hill it is
astonishing with what facility the indians are induced to remove
their dwellings there are villages in south america which in less
than half a century have thrice changed their situation the native
finds himself attached by ties so feeble to the soil he inhabits
that he receives with indifference the order to take down his house
and to rebuild it elsewhere a village changes its situation like a
camp wherever clay reeds and the leaves of the palm or heliconia
are found a house is built in a few days these compulsory changes
have often no other motive than the caprice of a missionary who
having recently arrived from spain fancies that the situation of
the mission is feverish or that it is not sufficiently exposed to
the winds whole villages have been transported several leagues
merely because the monk did not find the prospect from his house
sufficiently beautiful or extensive

guanaguana has as yet no church the old monk who during thirty
years had lived in the forests of america observed to us that the
money of the community or the produce of the labour of the
indians was employed first in the construction of the missionary's
house next in that of the church and lastly in the clothing of
the indians he gravely assured us that this order of things could
not be changed on any pretence and that the indians who prefer a
state of nudity to the slightest clothing are in no hurry for
their turn in the destination of the funds the spacious abode of
the padre had just been finished and we had remarked with
surprise that the house the roof of which formed a terrace was
furnished with a great number of chimneys that looked like turrets
this our host told us was done to remind him of a country dear to
his recollection and to picture to his mind the winters of aragon
amid the heat of the torrid zone the indians of guanaguana
cultivate cotton for their own benefit as well as for that of the
church and the missionary the natives have machines of a very
simple construction to separate the cotton from the seeds these
are wooden cylinders of extremely small diameter within which the
cotton passes and which are made to turn by a treadle these
machines however imperfect are very useful and they begin to be
imitated in other missions the soil of guanaguana is not less
fertile than that of aricagua a small neighbouring village which
has also preserved its ancient indian name an almuda of land 1850
square toises produces in abundant years from 25 to 30 fanegas of
maize each fanega weighing 100 pounds but here as in other
places where the bounty of nature retards industry a very small
number of acres are cleared and the culture of alimentary plants
is neglected scarcity of subsistence is felt whenever the harvest
is lost by a protracted drought the indians of guanaguana related
to us as a fact not uncommon that in the preceding year they
their wives and their children had been for three months al
monte by which they meant wandering in the neighbouring forests
to live on succulent plants palm-cabbages fern roots and fruits
of wild trees they did not speak of this nomad life as of a state
of privation

the beautiful valley of guanaguana stretches towards the east
opening into the plains of punzera and terecen we wished to visit
those plains and examine the springs of petroleum lying between
the river guarapiche and the rio areo but the rainy season had
already arrived and we were in daily perplexity how to dry and
preserve the plants we had collected the road from guanaguana to
the village of punzera runs either by san felix or by caycara and
guayuta which is a farm for cattle (hato) of the missionaries in
this last place according to the report of the indians great
masses of sulphur are found not in a gypseous or calcareous rock
but at a small depth below the soil in a bed of clay this
singular phenomenon appears to me peculiar to america we found it
also in the kingdom of quito and in new spain on approaching
punzera we saw in the savannahs small bags formed of a silky
tissue suspended from the branches of the lowest trees it is the
seda silvestre or wild silk of the country which has a beautiful
lustre but is very rough to the touch the phalaena which produces
it is probably analogous with that of the provinces of gua[?]uato
and antioquia which also furnish wild silk we found in the
beautiful forest of punzera two trees known by the names of curucay
and canela the former of which we shall speak hereafter yields a
resin very much sought after by the piaches or indian sorcerers
the leaves of the latter have the smell of the real cinnamon of
ceylon* (* is this the laurus cinnamomoides of mutis? what is that
other cinnamon tree which the indians call tuorco common in the
mountains of tocayo and at the sources of the rio uchere the bark
of which is mixed with chocolate? father caulin gives the name of
curucay to the copaifera officinalis which yields the balsam of
capivi hist corograf pages 24 and 34) from punzera the road
leads by terecin and nueva palencia (a new colony of canarians)
to the port of san juan situated on the right bank of the river
areo and it is only by crossing this river in a canoe that the
traveller can arrive at the famous petroleum springs (or mineral
tar) of the buen pastor they were described to us as small wells
or funnels hollowed out by nature in a marshy soil this
phenomenon reminded us of the lake of asphaltum or of chopapote
in the island of trinidad* (* laguna de la brea south-east of the
port of naparima there is another spring of asphaltum on the
eastern coast of the island in the bay of mayaro) which is
distant from the buen pastor in a straight line only thirty-five
sea leagues

having long struggled to overcome the desire we felt to descend the
guarapiche to the golfo triste we took the direct road to the
mountains the valleys of guanaguana and caripe are separated by a
kind of dyke or calcareous ridge well known by the name of the
cuchilla* de guanaguana (* literally "blade of a knife"
throughout all spanish america the name of "cuchilla" is given to
the ridge of a mountain terminated on each side by very steep
declivities) we found this passage difficult because at that time
we had not climbed the cordilleras but it is by no means so
dangerous as the people at cumana love to represent it the path is
indeed in several parts only fourteen or fifteen inches broad and
the ridge of the mountain along which the road runs is covered
with a short slippery turf the slopes on each side are steep and
the traveller should he stumble might slide down to the depth of
seven or eight hundred feet nevertheless the flanks of the
mountain are steep declivities rather than precipices and the
mules of this country are so sure-footed that they inspire the
greatest confidence their habits are identical with those of the
beasts of burden in switzerland and the pyrenees in proportion as
a country is wild the instinct of domestic animals improves in
address and sagacity when the mules feel themselves in danger
they stop turning their heads to the right and to the left and
the motion of their ears seems to indicate that they reflect on the
decision they ought to take their resolution is slow but always
just if it be spontaneous that is to say if it be not thwarted
or hastened by the imprudence of the traveller on the frightful
roads of the andes during journeys of six or seven months across
mountains furrowed by torrents the intelligence of horses and
beasts of burden is manifested in an astonishing manner thus the
mountaineers are heard to say "i will not give you the mule whose
step is the easiest but the one which is most intelligent (la mas
racional)" this popular expression dictated by long experience
bears stronger evidence against the theory of animated machines
than all the arguments of speculative philosophy

when we had reached the highest point of the ridge or cuchilla of
guanaguana an interesting spectacle unfolded itself before us we
saw comprehended in one view the vast savannahs or meadows of
maturin and of the rio tigre* (* these natural meadows are part of
the llanos or immense steppes bordered by the orinoco) the peak of
the turimiquiri* (* el cucurucho) and an infinite number of
parallel ridges which seen at a distance looked like the waves
of the sea on the north-east opens the valley in which is situated
the convent of caripe the aspect of this valley is peculiarly
attractive for being shaded by forests it forms a strong contrast
with the nudity of the neighbouring mountains which are bare of
trees and covered with gramineous plants we found the absolute
height of the cuchilla to be 548 toises

descending from the ridge by a winding path we entered into a
completely woody country the soil is covered with moss and a new
species of drosera* (* drosera tenella) which by its form
reminded us of the drosera of the alps the thickness of the
forests and the force of vegetation augmented as we approached
the convent of caripe everything here changes its aspect even to
the rock that accompanied us from punta delgada the calcareous
strata becomes thinner forming graduated steps which stretch out
like walls cornices and turrets as in the mountains of jura
those of pappenheim in germany and near oizow in galicia the
colour of the stone is no longer of a smoky or bluish grey it
becomes white its fracture is smooth and sometimes even
imperfectly conchoidal it is no longer the calcareous formation of
the higher alps but a formation to which this serves as a basis
and which is analogous to the jura limestone in the chain of the
apennines between rome and nocera i observed this same immediate
superposition* (* in like manner near geneva the rock of the
mole belonging to the alpine limestone lies under the jura
limestone which forms mount saleve) it indicates not the
transition from one rock to another but the geological affinity
existing between two formations according to the general type of
the secondary strata recognised in a great part of europe the
alpine limestone is separated from the jura limestone by the
muriatiferous gypsum but often this latter is entirely wanting or
is contained as a subordinate layer in the alpine limestone in
this case the two great calcareous formations succeed each other
immediately or are confounded in one mass

the descent from the cuchilla is far shorter than the ascent we
found the level of the valley of caripe 200 toises higher than that
of the valley of guanaguana* (* absolute height of the convent
above the level of the sea 412 toises) a group of mountains of
little breadth separates two valleys one of which is of delicious
coolness while the other is famed for the heat of its climate
these contrasts so common in mexico new grenada and peru are
very rare in the north-east part of south america thus caripe is
the only one of the high valleys of new andalusia which is much
inhabited

convent of caripe
cavern of the guacharo
nocturnal birds

an alley of perseas led us to the hospital of the aragonese
capuchins we stopped near a cross of brazil-wood erected in the
midst of a square and surrounded with benches on which the infirm
monks seat themselves to tell their rosaries the convent is backed
by an enormous wall of perpendicular rock covered with thick
vegetation the stone which is of resplendent whiteness appears
only here and there between the foliage it is difficult to imagine
a more picturesque spot it recalled forcibly to my remembrance the
valleys of derbyshire and the cavernous mountains of muggendorf
in franconia instead of the beeches and maple trees of europe we
here find the statelier forms of the ceiba and the palm-tree the
praga and irasse numberless springs gush from the sides of the
rocks which encircle the basin of caripe and of which the abrupt
slopes present towards the south profiles of a thousand feet in
height these springs issue for the most part from a few narrow
crevices the humidity which they spread around favours the growth
of the great trees and the natives who love solitary places form
their conucos along the sides of these crevices plantains and
papaw trees are grouped together with groves of arborescent fern
and this mixture of wild and cultivated plants gives the place a
peculiar charm springs are distinguished from afar on the naked
flanks of the mountains by tufted masses of vegetation* which at
first sight seem suspended from the rocks and descending into the
valley they follow the sinuosities of the torrents* (* among the
interesting plants of the valley of caripe we found for the first
time a calidium the trunk of which was twenty feet high (c
arboreum) the mikania micrantha which may probably possess some
of the alexipharmic properties of the famous guaco of the choco
the bauhinia obtusifolia a very large tree called guarapa by the
indians the weinnannia glabra a tree psychotria the capsules of
which when rubbed between the fingers emit a very agreeable
orange smell the dorstenia houstoni (raiz de resfriado) the
martynia craniolaria the white flowers of which are six or seven
inches long a scrophularia having the aspect of the verbascum
miconi and the leaves of which all radical and hairy are marked
with silvery glands)

we were received with great hospitality by the monks of caripe the
building has an inner court surrounded by an arcade like the
convents in spain this enclosed place was highly convenient for
setting up our instruments and making observations we found a
numerous society in the convent young monks recently arrived from
spain were just about to settle in the missions while old infirm
missionaries sought for health in the fresh and salubrious air of
the mountains of caripe i was lodged in the cell of the superior
which contained a pretty good collection of books i found there
to my surprise the teatro critico of feijoo the lettres
edifiantes and the traite d'electricite by abbe nollet it seemed
as if the progress of knowledge advanced even in the forests of
america the youngest of the capuchin monks of the last mission had
brought with him a spanish translation of chaptal's treatise on
chemistry and he intended to study this work in the solitude where
he was destined to pass the remainder of his days during our long
abode in the missions of south america we never perceived any sign
of intolerance the monks of caripe were not ignorant that i was
born in the protestant part of germany furnished as i was with
orders from the court of spain i had no motives to conceal from
them this fact nevertheless no mark of distrust no indiscreet
question no attempt at controversy ever diminished the value of
the hospitality they exercised with so much liberality and
frankness

the convent is founded on a spot which was anciently called
areocuar its height above the level of the sea is nearly the same
as that of the town of caracas or of the inhabited part of the
blue mountains of jamaica thus the mean temperatures of these
three points all situated within the tropics are nearly the same
the necessity of being well clothed at night and especially at
sunrise is felt at caripe we saw the centigrade thermometer at
midnight between 16 and 175 degrees in the morning between 19
and 20 degrees about one o'clock it had risen only to 21 or 225
degrees this temperature is sufficient for the development of the
productions of the torrid zone though compared with the excessive
heat of the plains of cumana we might call it the temperature of
spring water exposed to currents of air in vessels of porous clay
cools at caripe during the night as low as 13 degrees

experience has proved that the temperate climate and rarefied air
of this spot are singularly favourable to the cultivation of the
coffee-tree which is well known to flourish on heights the
prefect of the capuchins an active and enlightened man has
introduced into the province this new branch of agricultural
industry indigo was formerly planted at caripe but the small
quantity of fecula yielded by this plant which requires great
heat caused the culture to be abandoned we found in the conuco of
the community many culinary plants maize sugar cane and five
thousand coffee-trees which promised a fine harvest the friars
were in hopes of tripling the number in a few years we cannot help
remarking the uniform efforts for the cultivation of the soil which
are manifested in the policy of the monastic hierarchy wherever
convents have not yet acquired wealth in the new continent as
formerly in gaul in syria and in the north of europe they
exercise a happy influence on the clearing of the ground and the
introduction of exotic vegetation at caripe the conuco of the
community presents the appearance of an extensive and beautiful
garden the natives are obliged to work in it every morning from
six to ten and the alcaldes and alguazils of indian race overlook
their labours these men are looked upon as great state
functionaries and they alone have the right of carrying a cane
the selection of them depends on the superior of the convent the
pedantic and silent gravity of the indian alcaldes their cold and
mysterious air their love of appearing in form at church and in
the assemblies of the people force a smile from europeans we were
not yet accustomed to these shades of the indian character which
we found the same at the orinoco in mexico and in peru among
people totally different in their manners and their language the
alcaldes came daily to the convent less to treat with the monks on
the affairs of the mission than under the pretence of inquiring
after the health of the newly-arrived travellers as we gave them
brandy their visits became more frequent than the monks desired

that which confers most celebrity on the valley of caripe besides
the extraordinary coolness of its climate is the great cueva or
cavern of the guacharo* (* the province of guacharucu which
delgado visited in 1534 in the expedition of hieronimo de ortal
appears to have been situated south or south-east of macarapana
has its name any connexion with those of the cavern and the bird?
or is this last of spanish origin? (laet nova orbis page 676)
guacharo means in castilian "one who cries and laments" now the
bird of the cavern of caripe and the guacharaca (phasianus
parraka) are very noisy birds) in a country where the people love
the marvellous a cavern which gives birth to a river and is
inhabited by thousands of nocturnal birds the fat of which is
employed in the missions to dress food is an everlasting object of
conversation and discussion the cavern which the natives call "a
mine of fat" is not in the valley of caripe itself but three short
leagues distant from the convent in the direction of
west-south-west it opens into a lateral valley which terminates
at the sierra del guacharo

we set out for the sierra on the 18th of september accompanied by
the alcaldes or indian magistrates and the greater part of the
monks of the convent a narrow path led us at first towards the
south across a fine plain covered with beautiful turf we then
turned westward along the margin of a small river which issues
from the mouth of the cavern we ascended during three quarters of
an hour sometimes in the water which was shallow sometimes
between the torrent and a wall of rocks on a soil extremely
slippery and miry the falling down of the earth the scattered
trunks of trees over which the mules could scarcely pass and the
creeping plants that covered the ground rendered this part of the
road fatiguing we were surprised to find here at scarcely 500
toises above the level of the sea a cruciferous plant raphanus
pinnatus plants of this family are very rare in the tropics they
have in some sort a northern character and therefore we never
expected to see one on the plain of caripe at so inconsiderable an
elevation the northern character also appears in the galium
caripense the valeriana scandens and a sanicle not unlike the s
marilandica

at the foot of the lofty mountain of the guacharo we were only
four hundred paces from the cavern without yet perceiving the
entrance the torrent runs in a crevice hollowed out by the waters
and we went on under a cornice the projection of which prevented
us from seeing the sky the path winds in the direction of the
river and at the last turning we came suddenly before the immense
opening of the grotto the aspect of this spot is majestic even to
the eye of a traveller accustomed to the picturesque scenery of the
higher alps i had before this seen the caverns of the peak of
derbyshire where lying down flat in a boat we proceeded along a
subterranean river under an arch two feet high i had visited the
beautiful grotto of treshemienshiz in the carpathian mountains
the caverns of the hartz and those of franconia which are vast
cemeteries* containing bones of tigers hyenas and bears as
large as our horses (* the mould which has covered for thousands
of years the soil of the caverns of gaylenreuth and muggendorf in
franconia emits even now choke-damps or gaseous mixtures of
hydrogen and nitrogen which rise to the roof of the caves this
fact is known to the persons who show these caverns to travellers
and when i was director of the mines of the fichtelberg i observed
it frequently in the summer-time m laugier found in the mould of
muggendorf besides phosphate of lime 010 of animal matter i was
struck during my stay at steeben with the ammoniacal and fetid
smell produced by it when thrown on a red-hot iron) nature in
every zone follows immutable laws in the distribution of rocks in
the form of mountains and even in those changes which the exterior
crust of our planet has undergone so great a uniformity led me to
believe that the aspect of the cavern of caripe would differ little
from what i had observed in my preceding travels the reality far
exceeded my expectations if the configuration of the grottoes the
splendour of the stalactites and all the phenomena of inorganic
nature present striking analogies the majesty of equinoctial
vegetation gives at the same time an individual character to the
aperture of the cavern

the cueva del guacharo is pierced in the vertical profile of a
rock the entrance is towards the south and forms an arch eighty
feet broad and seventy-two high the rock which surmounts the
grotto is covered with trees of gigantic height the mammee-tree
and the genipa* (* caruto genipa americana the flower at caripe
has sometimes five sometimes six stamens) with large and shining
leaves raise their branches vertically towards the sky whilst
those of the courbaril and the erythrina form as they extend a
thick canopy of verdure plants of the family of pothos with
succulent stems oxalises and orchideae of a singular structure*
(* a dendrobium with a gold-coloured flower spotted with black
three inches long) rise in the driest clefts of the rocks while
creeping plants waving in the winds are interwoven in festoons
before the opening of the cavern we distinguished in these
festoons a bignonia of a violet blue the purple dolichos and for
the first time that magnificent solandra* (* solandra scandens
it is the gousaticha of the chayma indians) which has an
orange-coloured flower and a fleshy tube more than four inches
long

but this luxury of vegetation embellishes not only the external
arch it appears even in the vestibule of the grotto we saw with
astonishment plantain-leaved heliconias eighteen feet high the
praga palm-tree and arborescent arums following the course of the
river even to those subterranean places the vegetation continues
in the cave of caripe as in those deep crevices of the andes
half-excluded from the light of day and does not disappear till
penetrating into the interior we advance thirty or forty paces
from the entrance we measured the way by means of a cord and we
went on about four hundred and thirty feet without being obliged to
light our torches daylight penetrates far into this region
because the grotto forms but one single channel keeping the same
direction from south-east to north-west where the light began to
fail we heard from afar the hoarse sounds of the nocturnal birds
sounds which the natives think belong exclusively to those
subterraneous places

the guacharo is of the size of our fowls it has the mouth of the
goat-suckers and procnias and the port of those vultures whose
crooked beaks are surrounded with stiff silky hairs suppressing
with m cuvier the order of picae we must refer this
extraordinary bird to the passeres the genera of which are
connected with each other by almost imperceptible transitions it
forms a new genus very different from the goatsucker in the
loudness of its voice in the vast strength of its beak (containing
a double tooth) and in its feet without the membranes which unite
the anterior phalanges of the claws it is the first example of a
nocturnal bird among the passeres dentirostrati its habits present
analogies both with those of the goatsuckers and of the alpine
crow* (* corvus pyrrhocorax) the plumage of the guacharo is of a
dark bluish grey mixed with small streaks and specks of black
large white spots of the form of a heart and bordered with black
mark the head wings and tail the eyes of the bird which are
dazzled by the light of day are blue and smaller than those of
the goatsucker the spread of the wings which are composed of
seventeen or eighteen quill feathers is three feet and a half the
guacharo quits the cavern at nightfall especially when the moon
shines it is almost the only frugiferous nocturnal bird yet known
the conformation of its feet sufficiently shows that it does not
hunt like our owls it feeds on very hard fruits like the
nutcracker* (* corvus caryocatactes c glandarius our alpine crow
builds its nest near the top of mount libanus in subterranean
caverns nearly like the guacharo it also has the horribly shrill
cry of the latter) and the pyrrhocorax the latter nestles also in
clefts of rocks and is known by the name of the night-crow the
indians assured us that the guacharo does not pursue either the
lamellicornous insects or those phalaenae which serve as food to
the goatsuckers a comparison of the beaks of the guacharo and the
goatsucker serves to denote how much their habits must differ it
would be difficult to form an idea of the horrible noise occasioned
by thousands of these birds in the dark part of the cavern their
shrill and piercing cries strike upon the vaults of the rocks and
are repeated by the subterranean echoes the indians showed us the
nests of the guacharos by fixing a torch to the end of a long pole
these nests were fifty or sixty feet high above our heads in holes
in the shape of funnels with which the roof of the grotto is
pierced like a sieve the noise increased as we advanced and the
birds were scared by the light of the torches of copal when this
noise ceased a few minutes around us we heard at a distance the
plaintive cries of the birds roosting in other ramifications of the
cavern it seemed as if different groups answered each other
alternately

the indians enter the cueva del guacharo once a year near
midsummer they go armed with poles with which they destroy the
greater part of the nests at that season several thousand birds
are killed and the old ones as if to defend their brood hover
over the heads of the indians uttering terrible cries the young*
(* called los pollos del guacharo) which fall to the ground are
opened on the spot their peritoneum is found extremely loaded with
fat and a layer of fat reaches from the abdomen to the anus
forming a kind of cushion between the legs of the bird this
quantity of fat in frugivorous animals not exposed to the light
and exerting very little muscular motion reminds us of what has
been observed in the fattening of geese and oxen it is well known
how greatly darkness and repose favour this process the nocturnal
birds of europe are lean because instead of feeding on fruits
like the guacharo they live on the scanty produce of their prey
at the period commonly called at caripe the oil harvest* (* la
cosecha de la manteca) the indians build huts with palm-leaves
near the entrance and even in the porch of the cavern there with
a fire of brushwood they melt in pots of clay the fat of the young
birds just killed this fat is known by the name of butter or oil
(manteca or aceite) of the guacharo it is half liquid
transparent without smell and so pure that it may be kept above a
year without becoming rancid at the convent of caripe no other oil
is used in the kitchen of the monks but that of the cavern and we
never observed that it gave the aliments a disagreeable taste or
smell

the race of the guacharos would have been long ago extinct had not
several circumstances contributed to its preservation the natives
restrained by their superstitious ideas seldom have courage to
penetrate far into the grotto it appears also that birds of the
same species dwell in neighbouring caverns which are too narrow to
be accessible to man perhaps the great cavern is repeopled by
colonies which forsake the small grottoes for the missionaries
assured us that hitherto no sensible diminution of the birds has
been observed young guacharos have been sent to the port of
cumana and have lived there several days without taking any
nourishment the seeds offered to them not suiting their taste
when the crops and gizzards of the young birds are opened in the
cavern they are found to contain all sorts of hard and dry fruits
which furnish under the singular name of guacharo seed (semilla
del guacharo) a very celebrated remedy against intermittent
fevers the old birds carry these seeds to their young they are
carefully collected and sent to the sick at cariaco and other
places of the low regions where fevers are generally prevalent

as we continued to advance into the cavern we followed the banks
of the small river which issues from it and is from twenty-eight
to thirty feet wide we walked on the banks as far as the hills
formed of calcareous incrustations permitted us where the torrent
winds among very high masses of stalactites we were often obliged
to descend into its bed which is only two feet deep we learned
with surprise that this subterranean rivulet is the origin of the
river caripe which at the distance of a few leagues where it
joins the small river of santa maria is navigable for canoes it
flows into the river areo under the name of cano do terezen we
found on the banks of the subterranean rivulet a great quantity of
palm-tree wood the remains of trunks on which the indians climb
to reach the nests hanging from the roofs of the cavern the rings
formed by the vestiges of the old footstalks of the leaves furnish
as it were the steps of a ladder perpendicularly placed

the grotto of caripe preserves the same direction the same
breadth and its primitive height of sixty or seventy feet to the
distance of 472 metres or 1458 feet accurately measured we had
great difficulty in persuading the indians to pass beyond the
anterior portion of the grotto the only part which they annually
visit to collect the fat the whole authority of 'los padres' was
necessary to induce them to advance as far as the spot where the
soil rises abruptly at an inclination of sixty degrees and where
the torrent forms a small subterranean cascade* (* we find the
phenomenon of a subterranean cascade but on a much larger scale
in england at yordas cave near kingsdale in yorkshire) the
natives connect mystic ideas with this cave inhabited by nocturnal
birds they believe that the souls of their ancestors sojourn in
the deep recesses of the cavern "man" say they "should avoid
places which are enlightened neither by the sun (zis) nor by the
moon (nuna)" 'to go and join the guacharos' is with them a phrase
signifying to rejoin their fathers to die the magicians (piaches)
and the poisoners (imorons) perform their nocturnal tricks at the
entrance of the cavern to conjure the chief of the evil spirits
(ivorokiamo) thus in every region of the earth a resemblance may
be traced in the early fictions of nations those especially which
relate to two principles governing the world the abode of souls
after death the happiness of the virtuous and the punishment of
the guilty the most different and most barbarous languages present
a certain number of images which are the same because they have
their source in the nature of our intelligence and our sensations
darkness is everywhere connected with the idea of death the grotto
of caripe is the tartarus of the greeks and the guacharos which
hover over the rivulet uttering plaintive cries remind us of the
stygian birds

at the point where the river forms the subterranean cascade a hill
covered with vegetation which is opposite to the opening of the
grotto presents a very picturesque aspect it is seen at the
extremity of a straight passage 240 toises in length the
stalactites descending from the roof and resembling columns
suspended in the air are relieved on a back-ground of verdure the
opening of the cavern appeared singularly contracted when we saw
it about the middle of the day illumined by the vivid light
reflected at once from the sky the plants and the rocks the
distant light of day formed a strange contrast with the darkness
which surrounded us in the vast cavern we discharged our guns at a
venture wherever the cries of the nocturnal birds and the flapping
of their wings led us to suspect that a great number of nests were
crowded together after several fruitless attempts m bonpland
succeeded in killing a couple of guacharos which dazzled by the
light of the torches seemed to pursue us this circumstance
afforded me the means of making a drawing of this bird which had
previously been unknown to naturalists we climbed not without
difficulty the small hill whence the subterranean rivulet
descends we saw that the grotto was perceptibly contracted
retaining only forty feet in height and that it continued
stretching to north-east without deviating from its primitive
direction which is parallel to that of the great valley of caripe

in this part of the cavern the rivulet deposits a blackish mould
very like the matter which in the grotto of muggendorf in
franconia is called "the earth of sacrifice"* (* opfer-erde of
the cavern of hohle berg (or hole mountain a mountain pierced
entirely through)) we could not discover whether this fine and
spongy mould falls through the cracks which communicate with the
surface of the ground above or is washed down by the rain-water
penetrating into the cavern it was a mixture of silex alumina
and vegetable detritus we walked in thick mud to a spot where we
beheld with astonishment the progress of subterranean vegetation
the seeds which the birds carry into the grotto to feed their
young spring up wherever they fix in the mould which covers the
calcareous incrustations blanched stalks with some half-formed
leaves had risen to the height of two feet it was impossible to
ascertain the species of these plants their form colour and
aspect having been changed by the absence of light these traces of
organization amidst darkness forcibly excited the curiosity of the
natives who examined them with silent meditation inspired by a
place they seemed to dread they evidently regarded these
subterranean plants pale and deformed as phantoms banished from
the face of the earth to me the scene recalled one of the happiest
periods of my early youth a long abode in the mines of freyberg
where i made experiments on the effects of blanching (etiolement)
which are very different according as the air is pure or
overcharged with hydrogen or azote

the missionaries with all their authority could not prevail on
the indians to penetrate farther into the cavern as the roof
became lower the cries of the guacharos were more and more shrill
we were obliged to yield to the pusillanimity of our guides and
trace back our steps the appearance of the cavern was however very
uniform we found that a bishop of st thomas of guiana had gone
farther than ourselves he had measured nearly 2500 feet from the
mouth to the spot where he stopped but the cavern extended still
farther the remembrance of this fact was preserved in the convent
of caripe without the exact period being noted the bishop had
provided himself with great torches of white castile wax we had
torches composed only of the bark of trees and native resin the
thick smoke which issued from these torches in a narrow
subterranean passage hurts the eyes and obstructs the respiration

on turning back to go out of the cavern we followed the course of
the torrent before our eyes became dazzled with the light of day
we saw on the outside of the grotto the water of the river
sparkling amid the foliage of the trees which shaded it it was
like a picture placed in the distance the mouth of the cavern
serving as a frame having at length reached the entrance we
seated ourselves on the bank of the rivulet to rest after our
fatigues we were glad to be beyond the hoarse cries of the birds
and to leave a place where darkness does not offer even the charm
of silence and tranquillity we could scarcely persuade ourselves
that the name of the grotto of caripe had hitherto been unknown in
europe* for the guacharos alone might have sufficed to render it
celebrated (* it is surprising that father gili author of the
saggio di storia americana does not mention it though he had in
his possession a manuscript written in 1780 at the convent of
caripe i gave the first information respecting the cueva del
guacharo in 1800 in my letters to messrs delambre and
delametherie published in the journal de physique) these
nocturnal birds have been no where yet discovered except in the
mountains of caripe and cumanacoa the missionaries had prepared a
repast at the entry of the cavern leaves of the banana and the
vijao* (* heliconia bihai linn the creoles have changed the b of
the haitian word bihao into v and the h into j agreeably to the
castilian pronunciation) which have a silky lustre served us as a
table-cloth according to the custom of the country nothing was
wanting to our enjoyment not even remembrances which are so rare
in those countries where generations disappear without leaving a
trace of their existence

before we quit the subterranean rivulet and the nocturnal birds
let us cast a last glance at the cavern of the guacharo and the
whole of the physical phenomena it presents when we have step by
step pursued a long series of observations modified by the
localities of a place we love to stop and raise our views to
general considerations do the great cavities which are
exclusively called caverns owe their origin to the same causes as
those which have produced the lodes of veins and of metalliferous
strata or the extraordinary phenomenon of the porosity of rocks?
do grottoes belong to every formation or to that period only when
organized beings began to people the surface of the globe? these
geological questions can be solved only so far as they are directed
by the actual state of things that is of facts susceptible of
being verified by observation

considering rocks according to the succession of eras we find that
primitive formations exhibit very few caverns the great cavities
which are observed in the oldest granite and which are called
fours (ovens) in switzerland and in the south of france when they
are lined with rock crystals arise most frequently from the union
of several contemporaneous veins of quartz* (* gleichzeitige
trummer to these stone veins which appear to be of the same age as
the rock belong the veins of talc and asbestos in serpentine and
those of quartz traversing schist (thonschiefer) jameson on
contemporaneous veins in the mem of the wernerian soc) of
feldspar or of fine-grained granite the gneiss presents though
more seldom the same phenomenon and near wunsiedel* (* in
franconia south-east of luchsburg) at the fichtelgebirge i had
an opportunity of examining crystal fours of two or three feet
diameter in a part of the rock not traversed by veins we are
ignorant of the extent of the cavities which subterranean fires and
volcanic agitations may have produced in the bowels of the earth in
those primitive rocks which containing considerable quantities of
amphibole mica garnet magnetic iron-stone and red schorl
(titanite) appear to be anterior to granite we find some
fragments of these rocks among the matters ejected by volcanoes
the cavities can be considered only as partial and local phenomena
and their existence is scarcely any contradiction to the notions we
have acquired from the experiments of maskelyne and cavendish on
the mean density of the earth

in the primitive mountains open to our researches real grottoes
those which have some extent belong only to calcareous formations
such as the carbonate or sulphate of lime the solubility of these
substances appears to have favoured the action of the subterranean
waters for ages the primitive limestone presents spacious caverns
as well as transition limestone* and that which is exclusively
called secondary (* in the primitive limestone are found the
kuetzel-loch near kaufungen in silesia and probably several
caverns in the islands of the archipelago in the transition
limestone we remark the caverns of elbingerode of rubeland and of
scharzfeld in the hartz those of the salzfluhe in the grisons
and according to mr greenough that of torbay in devonshire) if
these caverns be less frequent in the first it is because this
stone forms in general only layers subordinate to the mica-slate*
(* sometimes to gneiss as at the simplon between dovredo and
crevola) and not a particular system of mountains into which the
waters may filter and circulate to great distances the erosions
occasioned by this element depend not only on its quantity but
also on the length of time during which it remains the velocity it
acquires by its fall and the degree of solubility of the rock i
have observed in general that the waters act more easily on the
carbonates and the sulphates of lime of secondary mountains than on
the transition limestones which have a considerable mixture of
silex and carbon on examining the internal structure of the
stalactites which line the walls of caverns we find in them all
the characters of a chemical precipitate

as we approach those periods in which organic life develops itself
in a greater number of forms the phenomenon of grottoes becomes
more frequent there exist several under the name of baumen* (* in
the dialect of the german swiss balmen the baumen of the sentis
of the mole and of the beatenberg on the borders of the lake of
thun belong to the alpine limestone) not in the ancient sandstone
to which the great coal formation belongs but in the alpine
limestone and in the jura limestone which is often only the
superior part of the alpine formation the jura limestone* (* i may
mention only the grottoes of boudry motiers-travers and valorbe
in the jura the grotto of balme near geneva the caverns between
muggendorf and gaylenreuth in franconia sowia jama ogrodzimiec
and wlodowice in poland) so abounds with caverns in both
continents that several geologists of the school of freyberg have
given it the name of cavern-limestone (hohlenkalkstein) it is this
rock which so often interrupts the course of rivers by engulfing
them into its bosom in this also is formed the famous cueva del
guacharo and the other grottoes of the valley of caripe the
muriatiferous gypsum* (* gypsum of bottendorf schlottengyps)
whether it be found in layers in the jura or alpine limestone or
whether it separate these two formations or lie between the alpine
limestone and argillaceous sandstone also presents on account of
its great solubility enormous cavities sometimes communicating
with each other at several leagues distance after the limestone
and gypseous formations there would remain to be examined among
the secondary rocks a third formation that of the argillaceous
sandstone newer than the brine-spring formations but this rock
composed of small grains of quartz cemented by clay seldom
contains caverns and when it does they are not extensive
progressively narrowing towards their extremity their walls are
covered with a brown ochre

we have just seen that the form of grottoes depends partly on the
nature of the rocks in which they are found but this form
modified by exterior agents often varies even in the same
formation the configuration of caverns like the outline of
mountains the sinuosity of valleys and so many other phenomena
present at first sight only irregularity and confusion the
appearance of order is resumed when we can extend our observations
over a vast space of ground which has undergone violent but
periodical and uniform revolutions from what i have seen in the
mountains of europe and in the cordilleras of america caverns may
be divided according to their interior structure into three
classes some have the form of large clefts or crevices like veins
not filled with ore such as the cavern of rosenmuller in
franconia elden-hole in the peak of derbyshire and the sumideros
of chamacasapa in mexico other caverns are open to the light at
both ends these are rocks really pierced natural galleries which
run through a solitary mountain such are the hohleberg of
muggendorf and the famous cavern called dantoe by the ottomite
indians and the bridge of the mother of god by the mexican
spaniards it is difficult to decide respecting the origin of these
channels which sometimes serve as beds for subterranean rivers
are these pierced rocks hollowed out by the impulse of a current?
or should we rather admit that one of the openings of the cavern is
owing to a falling down of the earth subsequent to its original
formation to a change in the external form of the mountain for
instance to a new valley opened on its flank? a third form of
caverns and the most common of the whole exhibits a succession of
cavities placed nearly on the same level running in the same
direction and communicating with each other by passages of greater
or less breadth

to these differences of general form are added other circumstances
not less remarkable it often happens that grottoes of little
space have extremely wide openings whilst we have to creep under
very low vaults in order to penetrate into the deepest and most
spacious caverns the passages which unite partial grottoes are
generally horizontal i have seen some however which resemble
funnels or wells and which may be attributed to the escape of some
elastic fluid through a mass before being hardened when rivers
issue from grottoes they form only a single horizontal
continuous channel the dilatations of which are almost
imperceptible as in the cueva del guacharo we have just described
and the cavern of san felipe near tehuilotepec in the western
cordilleras of mexico the sudden disappearance* of the river (* in
the night of the 16th april 1802) which took its rise from this
last cavern has impoverished a district in which farmers and
miners equally require water for refreshing the soil and for
working hydraulic machinery

considering the variety of structure exhibited by grottoes in both
hemispheres we cannot but refer their formation to causes totally
different when we speak of the origin of caverns we must choose
between two systems of natural philosophy one of these systems
attributes every thing to instantaneous and violent commotions (for
example to the elastic force of vapours and to the heavings
occasioned by volcanoes) while the other rests on the operation of
small powers which produce effects almost insensibly by
progressive action those who love to indulge in geological
hypotheses must not however forget the horizontality so often
remarked amidst gypseous and calcareous mountains in the position
of grottoes communicating with each other by passages this almost
perfect horizontality this gentle and uniform slope appears to be
the result of a long abode of the waters which enlarge by erosion
clefts already existing and carry off the softer parts the more
easily as clay or muriate of soda is found mixed with the gypsum
and fetid limestone these effects are the same whether the
caverns form one long and continued range or several of these
ranges lie one over another as happens almost exclusively in
gypseous mountains

that which in shelly or neptunean rocks is caused by the action of
the waters appears sometimes to be in the volcanic rocks the
effect of gaseous emanations* acting in the direction where they
find the least resistance (* at vesuvius the duke de la torre
showed me in 1805 in currents of recent lava cavities extending
in the direction of the current six or seven feet long and three
feet high these little volcanic caverns were lined with specular
iron which cannot be called oligiste iron since m gay-lussac's
last experiments on the oxides of iron) when melted matter moves
on a very gentle slope the great axis of the cavity formed by the
elastic fluids is nearly horizontal or parallel to the plane on
which the movement of transition takes place a similar
disengagement of vapours joined to the elastic force of the gases
which penetrate strata softened and raised up appears sometimes to
have given great extent to the caverns found in trachytes or
trappean porphyries these porphyritic caverns in the cordilleras
of quito and peru bear the indian name of machays* (* machay is a
word of the quichua language commonly called by the spaniards the
incas' language callancamachay means a cavern as large as a house
a cavern that serves as a tambo or caravansarai) they are in
general of little depth they are lined with sulphur and differ by
the enormous size of their openings from those observed in volcanic
tufas* in italy at teneriffe and in the andes (*sometimes fire
acts like water in carrying off masses and thus the cavities may
be caused by an igneous though more frequently by an aqueous
erosion or solution) it is by connecting in the mind the
primitive secondary and volcanic rocks and distinguishing
between the oxidated crust of the globe and the interior nucleus
composed perhaps of metallic and inflammable substances that we
may account for the existence of grottoes everywhere they act in
the economy of nature as vast reservoirs of water and of elastic
fluids

the gypseous caverns glitter with crystallized selenites vitreous
crystallized plates of brown and yellow stand out on a striated
ground composed of layers of alabaster and fetid limestone the
calcareous grottoes have a more uniform tint they are more
beautiful and richer in stalactites in proportion as they are
narrower and the circulation of air is less free by being
spacious and accessible to air the cavern of caripe is almost
destitute of those incrustations the imitative forms of which are
in other countries objects of popular curiosity i also sought in
vain for subterranean plants those cryptogamia of the family of
the usneaceae which we sometimes find fixed on the stalactites
like ivy on walls when we penetrate for the first time into a
lateral grotto* (* lichen tophicola was discovered when the
beautiful cavern of rosenmuller in franconia was first opened the
cavity containing the lichen was found closed on all sides by
enormous masses of stalactite)

the caverns in mountains of gypsum often contain mephitic
emanations and deleterious gases it is not the sulphate of lime
that acts on the atmospheric air but the clay slightly mixed with
carbon and the fetid limestone so often mingled with the gypsum
we cannot yet decide whether the swinestone acts as a
hydrosulphuret or by means of a bituminous principle* (* that
description of fetid limestone called by the german mineralogists
stinkstein is always of a blackish brown colour it is only by
decomposition that it becomes white after having acted on the
surrounding air the stinkstein which is of secondary formation
must not be confounded with a very white primitive granular
limestone of the island of thasos which emits when scraped a
smell of sulphuretted hydrogen this marble is coarser grained than
carrara (marmor lunense) it was frequently employed by the grecian
sculptors and i often picked up fragments of it at the villa
adriani near rome) its property of absorbing oxygen gas is known
to all the miners of thuringia it is the same as the action of the
carburetted clay of the gypseous grottoes and of the great
chambers (sinkwerke) dug in mines of fossil salt which are worked
by the introduction of fresh water the caverns of calcareous
mountains are not exposed to those decompositions of the
atmospheric air unless they contain bones of quadrupeds or the
mould mixed with animal gluten and phosphate of lime from which
arise inflammable and fetid gases

though we made many enquiries among the inhabitants of caripe
cumanacoa and cariaco we did not learn that they had ever
discovered in the cavern of guacharo either the remains of
carnivorous animals or those bony breccias of herbivorous animals
which are found in the caverns of germany and hungary and in the
clefts of the calcareous rocks of gibraltar the fossil bones of
the megatherium of the elephant and of the mastodon which
travellers have brought from south america have all been found in
the light soil of the valleys and table-lands excepting the
megalonyx* a kind of sloth of the size of an ox described by mr
jefferson i know not a single instance of the skeleton of an
animal buried in a cavern of the new world (* the megalonyx was
found in the caverns of green briar in virginia at the distance
of 1500 leagues from the megatherium which resembles it very much
and is of the size of the rhinoceros) the extreme scarcity of this
geological phenomenon will appear the less surprising to us if we
recollect that in france england and italy there are also a
great number of grottoes in which we have never met with any
vestige of fossil bones

although in primitive nature whatever relates to ideas of extent
and mass is of no great importance yet i may observe that the
cavern of caripe is one of the most spacious known to exist in
limestone formations it is at least 900 metres or 2800 feet in
length* (* the famous baumannshohle in the hartz according to
messrs gilbert and ilsen is only 578 feet in length the cavern
of scharzfeld 350 that of gaylenreuth 304 that of antiparos 300
but according to saussure the grotto of balme is 1300 feet) owing
to the different degrees of solubility in rocks it is generally
not in calcareous mountains but in gypseous formations that we
find the most extensive succession of grottoes in saxony there are
some in gypsum several leagues in length for instance that of
wimelburg which communicates with the cavern of cresfield

the determination of the temperature of grottoes presents a field
for interesting observation the cavern of caripe situated nearly
in the latitude of 10 degrees 10 minutes consequently in the
centre of the torrid zone is elevated 506 toises above the level
of the sea in the gulf of cariaco we found that in every part of
it in the month of september the temperature of the internal air
was between 184 and 189 degrees of the centesimal thermometer
the external atmosphere being at 162 degrees at the entrance of
the cavern the thermometer in the open air was at 176 degrees
but when immersed in the water of the little subterranean river it
marked even to the end of the cavern 168 degrees these
experiments are very interesting if we reflect on the tendency to
equilibrium of heat in the waters the air and the earth when i
left europe men of science were regretting that they had not
sufficient data on what is called the temperature of the interior
of the globe and it is but very recently that efforts have been
made and with some success to solve the grand problem of
subterranean meteorology the stony strata that form the crust of
our planet are alone accessible to our examination and we now
know that the mean temperature of these strata varies not only with
latitudes and heights but that according to the position of the
several places it performs also in the space of a year regular
oscillations round the mean heat of the neighbouring atmosphere
the time is gone by when men were surprised to find in other
zones the heat of grottoes and wells differing from that observed
in the caves of the observatory at paris the same instrument which
in those caves marks 12 degrees rises in the subterraneous caverns
of the island of madeira near funchal to 162 degrees in
joseph's well at cairo* to 212 degrees (* at funchal (latitude 32
degrees 37 minutes) the mean temperature of the air is 204
degrees and at cairo (latitude 30 degrees 2 minutes) according to
nouet it is 224 degrees) in the grottoes of the island of cuba
to 22 or 23 degrees* (* the mean temperature of the air at the
havannah according to mr ferrer is 256 degrees) this increase
is nearly in proportion to that of the mean temperature of the
atmosphere from latitude 48 degrees to the tropics

we have just seen that in the cueva del guacharo the water of the
river is nearly 2 degrees colder than the ambient air of the
cavern the water whether in filtering through the rocks or in
running over stony beds doubtless imbibes the temperature of these
beds the air contained in the grotto on the contrary is not in
repose it communicates with the external atmosphere though under
the torrid zone the changes of the external temperature are
exceedingly trifling currents are formed which modify
periodically the internal air it is consequently the temperature
of the waters that of 168 degrees which we might look upon as
the temperature of the earth in those mountains if we were sure
that the waters do not descend rapidly from more elevated
neighbouring mountains

it follows from these observations that when we cannot obtain
results perfectly exact we find at least under each zone certain
numbers which indicate the maximum and minimum at caripe in the
equinoctial zone at an elevation of 500 toises the mean
temperature of the globe is not below 168 degrees which was the
degree indicated by the water of the subterranean river we can
even prove that this temperature of the globe is not above 19
degrees since the air of the cavern in the month of september
was found to be at 187 degrees as the mean temperature of the
atmosphere in the hottest month does not exceed 195 degrees* it
is probable that a thermometer in the grotto would not rise higher
than 19 degrees at any season of the year (* the mean temperature
of the month of september at caripe is 185 degrees and on the
coast of cumana where we had opportunities of making numerous
observations the mean heat of the warmest months differs only 18
degrees from that of the coldest)

departure from caripe
mountain and forest of santa maria
mission of catuaro
port of cariaco

the days we passed at the capuchin convent in the mountains of
caripe glided swiftly away though our manner of living was simple
and uniform from sunrise to nightfall we traversed the forests and
neighbouring mountains to collect plants when the winter rains
prevented us from undertaking distant excursions we visited the
huts of the indians the conuco of the community or those
assemblies in which the alcaldes every evening arrange the labours
of the succeeding day we returned to the monastery only when the
sound of the bell called us to the refectory to share the repasts
of the missionaries sometimes very early in the morning we
followed them to the church to attend the doctrina that is to
say the religious instruction of the indians it was rather a
difficult task to explain dogmas to the neophytes especially those
who had but a very imperfect knowledge of the spanish language on
the other hand the monks are as yet almost totally ignorant of the
language of the chaymas and the resemblance of sounds confuses the
poor indians and suggests to them the most whimsical ideas of this
i may cite an example i saw a missionary labouring earnestly to
prove that infierno hell and invierno winter were not one and
the same thing but as different as heat and cold the chaymas are
acquainted with no other winter than the season of rains and
consequently they imagined the hell of the whites to be a place
where the wicked are exposed to frequent showers the missionary
harangued to no purpose it was impossible to efface the first
impression produced by the analogy between the two consonants he
could not separate in the minds of the neophytes the ideas of rain
and hell invierno and infierno

after passing almost the whole day in the open air we employed our
evenings at the convent in making notes drying our plants and
sketching those that appeared to form new genera unfortunately the
misty atmosphere of a valley where the surrounding forests fill
the air with an enormous quantity of vapour was unfavourable to
astronomical observations i spent a part of the nights waiting to
take advantage of the moment when some star should be visible
between the clouds near its passage over the meridian i often
shivered with cold though the thermometer only sunk to 16 degrees
which is the temperature of the day in our climates towards the end
of september the instruments remained set up in the court of the
convent for several hours yet i was almost always disappointed in
my expectations some good observations of fomalhaut and of deneb
have given 10 degrees 10 minutes 14 seconds as the latitude of
caripe which proves that the position indicated in the maps of
caulin is 18 minutes wrong and in that of arrowsmith 14 minutes

observations of corresponding altitudes of the sun having given me
the true time within about 2 seconds i was enabled to determine
the magnetic variation with precision at noon it was on the 20th
of september 1799 3 degrees 15 minutes 30 seconds north-east
consequently 0 degrees 58 minutes 15 seconds less than at cumana
if we attend to the influence of the horary variations which in
these countries do not in general exceed 8 minutes we shall find
that at considerable distances the variation changes less rapidly
than is usually supposed the dip of the needle was 4275 degrees
centesimal division and the number of oscillations expressing the
intensity of the magnetic forces rose to 229 in ten minutes

the vexation of seeing the stars disappear in a misty sky was the
only disappointment we felt in the valley of caripe the aspect of
this spot presents a character at once wild and tranquil gloomy
and attractive in the solitude of these mountains we are perhaps
less struck by the new impressions we receive at every step than
with the marks of resemblance we trace in climates the most remote
from each other the hills by which the convent is backed are
crowned with palm-trees and arborescent ferns in the evenings
when the sky denotes rain the air resounds with the monotonous
howling of the alouate apes which resembles the distant sound of
wind when it shakes the forest yet amid these strange sounds
these wild forms of plants and these prodigies of a new world
nature everywhere speaks to man in a voice familiar to him the
turf that overspreads the soil the old moss and fern that cover
the roots of the trees the torrents that gush down the sloping
banks of the calcareous rocks in fine the harmonious accordance
of tints reflected by the waters the verdure and the sky
everything recalls to the traveller sensations which he has
already felt

the beauties of this mountain scenery so much engaged us that we
were very tardy in observing the embarrassment felt by our kind
entertainers the monks they had but a slender provision of wine
and wheaten bread and although in those high regions both are
considered as belonging merely to the luxuries of the table yet we
saw with regret that our hosts abstained from them on our account
our portion of bread had already been diminished three-fourths yet
violent rains still obliged us to delay our departure for two days
how long did this delay appear it made us dread the sound of the
bell that summoned us to the refectory

we departed at length on the 22nd of september followed by four
mules laden with our instruments and plants we had to descend the
north-east slope of the calcareous alps of new andalusia which we
have called the great chain of the brigantine and the cocollar the
mean elevation of this chain scarcely exceeds six or seven hundred
toises in respect to height and geological constitution we may
compare it to the chain of the jura notwithstanding the
inconsiderable elevation of the mountains of cumana the descent is
extremely difficult and dangerous in the direction of cariaco the
cerro of santa maria which the missionaries ascend in their
journey from cumana to their convent at caripe is famous for the
difficulties it presents to travellers on comparing these
mountains with the andes of peru the pyrenees and the alps which
we successively visited it has more than once occurred to us that
the less lofty summits are sometimes the most inaccessible

on leaving the valley of caripe we first crossed a ridge of hills
north-east of the convent the road led us along a continual ascent
through a vast savannah as far as the table-land of guardia de san
augustin we there halted to wait for the indian who carried the
barometer we found ourselves to be at 533 toises of absolute
elevation or a little higher than the bottom of the cavern of
guacharo the savannahs or natural meadows which yield excellent
pasture for the cows of the convent are totally devoid of trees or
shrubs it is the domain of the monocotyledonous plants for amidst
the gramina only a few maguey* plants rise here and there (* agave
americana) their flowery stalks being more than twenty-six feet
high having reached the table-land of guardia we appeared to be
transported to the bed of an old lake levelled by the
long-continued abode of the waters we seemed to trace the
sinuosities of the ancient shore in the tongues of land which jut
out from the craggy rock and even in the distribution of the
vegetation the bottom of the basin is a savannah while its banks
are covered with trees of full growth this is probably the most
elevated valley in the provinces of venezuela and cumana one
cannot but regret that a spot favoured by so temperate a climate
and which without doubt would be fit for the culture of corn is
totally uninhabited

from the table-land of guardia we continued to descend till we
reached the indian village of santa cruz we passed at first along
a slope extremely slippery and steep to which the missionaries had
given the name of baxada del purgatorio or descent of purgatory
it is a rock of schistose sandstone decomposed covered with clay
the talus of which appears frightfully steep from the effect of a
very common optical illusion when we look down from the top to the
bottom of the hill the road seems inclined more than 60 degrees
the mules in going down draw their hind legs near to their fore
legs and lowering their cruppers let themselves slide at a
venture the rider runs no risk provided he slacken the bridle
thereby leaving the animal quite free in his movements from this
point we perceived towards the left the great pyramid of guacharo
the appearance of this calcareous peak is very picturesque but we
soon lost sight of it on entering the thick forest known by the
name of the montana de santa maria we descended without
intermission for seven hours it is difficult to conceive a more
tremendous descent it is absolutely a road of steps a kind of
ravine in which during the rainy season impetuous torrents dash
from rock to rock the steps are from two to three feet high and
the beasts of burden after measuring with their eyes the space
necessary to let their load pass between the trunks of the trees
leap from one rock to another afraid of missing their mark we saw
them stop a few minutes to scan the ground and bring together
their four feet like wild goats if the animal does not reach the
nearest block of stone he sinks half his depth into the soft
ochreous clay that fills up the interstices of the rock when the
blocks are wanting enormous roots serve as supports for the feet
of men and beasts some of these roots are twenty inches thick and
they often branch out from the trunks of the trees much above the
level of the soil the creoles have sufficient confidence in the
address and instinct of the mules to remain in their saddles
during this long and dangerous descent fearing fatigue less than
they did and being accustomed to travel slowly for the purpose of
gathering plants and examining the nature of the rocks we
preferred going down on foot and indeed the care which our
chronometers demanded left us no liberty of choice

the forest that covers the steep flank of the mountain of santa
maria is one of the thickest i ever saw the trees are of
stupendous height and size under their bushy deep green foliage
there reigns continually a kind of dim daylight a peculiar sort of
obscurity of which our forests of pines oaks and beech-trees
convey no idea notwithstanding its elevated temperature it is
difficult to believe that the air can dissolve the quantity of
water exhaled from the surface of the soil the foliage of the
trees and their trunks the latter are covered with a drapery of
orchideae peperomia and other succulent plants with the aromatic
odour of the flowers the fruit and even the wood is mingled that
which we perceive in autumn in misty weather here as in the
forests of the orinoco fixing our eyes on the top of the trees we
discerned streams of vapour whenever a solar ray penetrated and
traversed the dense atmosphere our guides pointed out to us among
those majestic trees the height of which exceeded 120 or 130 feet
the curucay of terecen it yields a whitish liquid and very
odoriferous resin which was formerly employed by the cumanagoto
and tagiri indians to perfume their idols the young branches have
an agreeable taste though somewhat astringent next to the curucay
and enormous trunks of hymenaea (the diameter of which was more
than nine or ten feet) the trees which most excited our attention
were the dragon's blood (croton sanguifluum) the purple-brown
juice of which flows down a whitish bark the calahuala fern
different from that of peru but almost equally medicinal* (* the
calahuala of caripe is the polypodium crassifolium that of peru
the use of which has been so much extended by messrs ruiz and
pavon comes from the aspidium coriaceum willd (tectaria
calahuala cav) in commerce the diaphoretic roots of the
polypodium crassifolium and of the acrostichum huascaro are mixed
with those of the calahuala or aspidium coriaceum) and the
palm-trees irasse macanilla corozo and praga* (* aiphanes
praga) the last yields a very savoury palm-cabbage which we had
sometimes eaten at the convent of caripe these palms with pinnated
and thorny leaves formed a pleasing contrast to the fern-trees one
of the latter the cyathea speciosa* grows to the height of more
than thirty-five feet a prodigious size for plants of this family
(* possibly a hemitelia of robert brown the trunk alone is from 22
to 24 feet long this and the cyathea excelsa of the mauritius are
the most majestic of all the fern-trees described by botanists the
total number of these gigantic cryptogamous plants amounts at
present to 25 species that of the palm-trees to 80 with the
cyathea grow on the mountain of santa maria rhexia juniperina
chiococca racemosa and commelina spicata) we discovered here and
in the valley of caripe five new kinds of arborescent ferns* (*
meniscium arborescens aspidium caducum a rostratum cyathea
villosa and c speciosa) in the time of linnaeus botanists knew
no more than four on both continents

we observed that the fern-trees are in general much more rare than
the palm-trees nature has confined them to temperate moist and
shady places they shun the direct rays of the sun and while the
pumos the corypha of the steppes and other palms of america
flourish on the barren and burning plains these ferns with
arborescent trunks which at a distance look like palm-trees
preserve the character and habits of cryptogamous plants they love
solitary places little light moist temperate and stagnant air
if they sometimes descend towards the sea-coast it is only under
cover of a thick shade the old trunks of the cyathea and the
meniscium are covered with a carbonaceous powder which probably
being deprived of hydrogen has a metallic lustre like plumbago no
other plant presents this phenomenon for the trunks of the
dicotyledons in spite of the heat of the climate and the
intensity of the light are less burnt within the tropics than in
the temperate zone it may be said that the trunks of the ferns
which like the monocotyledons are enlarged by the remains of the
petioles decay from the circumference to the centre and that
deprived of the cortical organs through which the elaborated juices
descend to the roots they are burnt more easily by the action of
the oxygen of the atmosphere i brought to europe some powders with
metallic lustre taken from very old trunks of meniscium and
aspidium

in proportion as we descended the mountain of santa maria we saw
the arborescent ferns diminish and the number of palm-trees
increase the beautiful large-winged butterflies (nymphales) which
fly at a prodigious height became more common everything denoted
our approach to the coast and to a zone in which the mean
temperature of the day is from 28 to 30 degrees

the weather was cloudy and led us to fear one of those heavy
rains during which from 1 to 13 inches of water sometimes falls
in a day the sun at times illumined the tops of the trees and
though sheltered from its rays we felt an oppressive heat thunder
rolled at a distance the clouds seemed suspended on the top of the
lofty mountains of the guacharo and the plaintive howling of the
araguatoes which we had so often heard at caripe denoted the
proximity of the storm we now for the first time had a near view
of these howling apes they are of the family of the alouates* (*
stentor geoffroy) the different species of which have long been
confounded one with another the small sapajous of america which
imitate in whistling the tones of the passeres have the bone of
the tongue thin and simple but the apes of large size as the
alouates and marimondes* (* ateles geoffroy) have the tongue
placed on a large bony drum their superior larynx has six pouches
in which the voice loses itself and two of which shaped like
pigeons' nests resemble the inferior larynx of birds the air
driven with force into the bony drum produces that mournful sound
which characterises the araguatoes i sketched on the spot these
organs which are imperfectly known to anatomists and published
the description of them on my return to europe

the araguato which the tamanac indians call aravata* (* in the
writings of the early spanish missionaries this monkey is
described by the names of aranata and araguato in both names we
easily discover the same root the v has been transformed into g
and n the name of arabata which gumilla gives to the howling apes
of the lower orinoco and which geoffroy thinks belongs to the s
straminea of great paria is the same tamanac word aravata this
identity of names need not surprise us the language of the chayma
indians of cumana is one of the numerous branches of the tamanac
language and the latter is connected with the caribbee language of
the lower orinoco) and the maypures marave resembles a young
bear* (* alouate ourse (simia ursina)) it is three feet long
reckoning from the top of the head (which is small and very
pyramidal) to the beginning of the prehensile tail its fur is
bushy and of a reddish brown the breast and belly are covered
with fine hair and not bare as in the mono colorado or alouate
roux of buffon which we carefully examined in going from
carthagena to santa fe de bogota the face of the araguato is of a
blackish blue and is covered with a fine and wrinkled skin its
beard is pretty long and notwithstanding the direction of the
facial line the angle of which is only thirty degrees the
araguato has in the expression of the countenance as much
resemblance to man as the marimonde (s belzebuth bresson) and the
capuchin of the orinoco (s chiropotes) among thousands of
araguatoes which we observed in the provinces of cumana caracas
and guiana we never saw any change in the reddish brown fur of the
back and shoulders whether we examined individuals or whole
troops it appeared to me in general that variety of colour is
less frequent among monkeys than naturalists suppose

the araguato of caripe is a new species of the genus stentor which
i have above described it differs equally from the ouarine (s
guariba) and the alouate roux (s seniculus old man of the woods)
its eye voice and gait denote melancholy i have seen young
araguatoes brought up in indian huts they never play like the
little sagoins and their gravity was described with much
simplicity by lopez de gomara in the beginning of the sixteenth
century "the aranata de los cumaneses" says this author "has the
face of a man the beard of a goat and a grave demeanour (honrado
gesto)" monkeys are more melancholy in proportion as they have
more resemblance to man their sprightliness diminishes as their
intellectual faculties appear to increase

we stopped to observe some howling monkeys which to the number of
thirty or forty crossed the road passing in a file from one tree
to another over the horizontal and intersecting branches while we
were observing their movements we saw a troop of indians going
towards the mountains of caripe they were without clothing as the
natives of this country generally are the women laden with rather
heavy burdens closed the march the men were all armed and even
the youngest boys had bows and arrows they moved on in silence
with their eyes fixed on the ground we endeavoured to learn from
them whether we were yet far from the mission of santa cruz where
we intended passing the night we were overcome with fatigue and
suffered from thirst the heat increased as the storm drew near
and we had not met with a single spring on the way the words si
patre no patre which the indians continually repeated led us to
think they understood a little spanish in the eyes of a native
every white man is a monk a padre for in the missions the colour
of the skin characterizes the monk more than the colour of the
garment in vain we questioned them respecting the length of the
way they answered as if by chance si and no without our being
able to attach any precise sense to their replies this made us the
more impatient as their smiles and gestures indicated their wish
to direct us and the forest seemed at every step to become thicker
and thicker at length we separated from the indians our guides
were able to follow us only at a distance because the beasts of
burden fell at every step in the ravines

after journeying for several hours continually descending on
blocks of scattered rock we found ourselves unexpectedly at the
outlet of the forest of santa maria a savannah the verdure of
which had been renewed by the winter rains stretched before us
farther than the eye could reach on the left we discovered a
narrow valley extending as far as the mountains of the guacharo
and covered with a thick forest looking downward the eye rested
on the tops of the trees which at eight hundred feet below the
road formed a carpet of verdure of a dark and uniform tint the
openings in the forest appeared like vast funnels in which we
could distinguish by their elegant forms and pinnated leaves the
praga and irasse palms but what renders this spot eminently
picturesque is the aspect of the sierra del guacharo its northern
slope in the direction of the gulf of cariaco is abrupt it
presents a wall of rock an almost vertical profile exceeding 3000
feet in height the vegetation which covers this wall is so scanty
that the eye can follow the lines of the calcareous strata the
summit of the sierra is flat and it is only at its eastern
extremity that the majestic peak of the guacharo rises like an
inclined pyramid its form resembles that of the needles and horns*
of the alps (* the shreckhorner the finsteraarhorn etc)

the savannah we crossed to the indian village of santa cruz is
composed of several smooth plateaux lying above each other like
terraces this geological phenomenon which is repeated in every
climate seems to indicate a long abode of the waters in basins
that have poured them from one to the other the calcareous rock is
no longer visible but is covered with a thick layer of mould the
last time we saw it in the forest of santa maria it was slightly
porous and looked more like the limestone of cumanacoa than that
of caripe we there found brown iron-ore disseminated in patches
and if we were not deceived in our observation a cornu-ammonis
which we could not succeed in our attempt to detach it was seven
inches in diameter this fact is the more important as in this
part of america we have never seen ammonites the mission of santa
cruz is situated in the midst of the plain we reached it towards
the evening suffering much from thirst having travelled nearly
eight hours without finding water the thermometer kept at 26
degrees accordingly we were not more than 190 toises above the
level of the sea

we passed the night in one of those ajupas called king's houses
which as i have already said serve as tambos or caravanserais to
travellers the rains prevented any observations of the stars and
the next day the 23rd of september we continued our descent
towards the gulf of cariaco beyond santa cruz a thick forest again
appears and in it we found under tufts of melastomas a beautiful
fern with osmundia leaves which forms a new genus of the order of
polypodiaceous plants* (* polybotya)

having reached the mission of catuaro we were desirous of
continuing our journey eastward by santa rosalia casanay san
josef carupano rio carives and the montana of paria but we
learnt with great regret that torrents of rain had rendered the
roads impassable and that we should run the risk of losing the
plants we had already gathered a rich planter of cacao-trees was
to accompany us from santa rosalia to the port of carupano but
when the time of departure approached we were informed that his
affairs had called him to cumana we resolved in consequence to
embark at cariaco and to return directly by the gulf instead of
passing between the island of margareta and the isthmus of araya
the mission of catuaro is situated on a very wild spot trees of
full growth still surround the church and the tigers come by night
to devour the poultry and swine belonging to the indians we lodged
at the dwelling of the priest a monk of the congregation of the
observance to whom the capuchins had confided the mission because
priests of their own community were wanting

at this mission we met don alexandro mexia the corregidor of the
district an amiable and well-educated man he gave us three
indians who armed with their machetes were to precede us and
cut our way through the forest in this country so little
frequented the power of vegetation is such at the period of the
great rains that a man on horseback can with difficulty make his
way through narrow paths covered with lianas and intertwining
branches to our great annoyance the missionary of catuaro
insisted on conducting us to cariaco and we could not decline the
proposal the movement for independence which had nearly broken
out at caracas in 1798 had been preceded and followed by great
agitation among the slaves at coro maracaybo and cariaco at the
last of these places an unfortunate negro had been condemned to
die and our host the vicar of catuaro was going thither to offer
him spiritual comfort during our journey we could not escape
conversations in which the missionary pertinaciously insisted on
the necessity of the slave-trade on the innate wickedness of the
blacks and the benefit they derived from their state of slavery
among the christians the mildness of spanish legislation compared
with the black code of most other nations that have possessions in
either of the indies cannot be denied but such is the state of
the negroes that justice far from efficaciously protecting them
during their lives cannot even punish acts of barbarity which
cause their death

the road we took across the forest of catuaro resembled the descent
of the mountain santa maria here also the most difficult and
dangerous places have fanciful names we walked as in a narrow
furrow scooped out by torrents and filled with fine tenacious
clay the mules lowered their cruppers and slid down the steepest
slopes this descent is called saca manteca* (* or the
butter-slope manteca in spanish signifies butter) there is no
danger in the descent owing to the great address of the mules of
this country the clay which renders the soil so slippery is
produced by the numerous layers of sandstone and schistose clay
crossing the bluish grey alpine limestone this last disappears as
we draw nearer to cariaco when we reached the mountain of meapira
we found it formed in great part of a white limestone filled with
fossil remains and from the grains of quartz agglutinated in the
mass it appeared to belong to the great formation of the sea-coast
breccias we descended this mountain on the strata of the rock the
section of which forms steps of unequal height farther on going
out of the forest we reached the hill of buenavista* (* mountain
of the fine prospect) well deserving the name it bears since it
commands a view of the town of cariaco situated in the midst of a
vast plain filled with plantations huts and scattered groups of
cocoa-palms to the west of cariaco extends the wide gulf which a
wall of rock separates from the ocean and towards the east are
seen like bluish clouds the high mountains of paria and areo
this is one of the most extensive and magnificent prospects that
can be enjoyed on the coast of new andalusia in the town of
cariaco we found a great part of the inhabitants suffering from
intermittent fever a disease which in autumn assumes a formidable
character when we consider the extreme fertility of the
surrounding plains their moisture and the mass of vegetation with
which they are covered we may easily conceive why amidst so much
decomposition of organic matter the inhabitants do not enjoy that
salubrity of air which characterizes the climate of cumana

the chain of calcareous mountains of the brigantine and the
cocollar sends off a considerable branch to the north which joins
the primitive mountains of the coast this branch bears the name of
sierra de meapire but towards the town of cariaco it is called
cerro grande de curiaco its mean height did not appear to be more
than 150 or 200 toises it was composed where i could examine it
of the calcareous breccias of the sea-coast marly and calcareous
beds alternate with other beds containing grains of quartz it is a
very striking phenomenon for those who study the physical aspect of
a country to see a transverse ridge connect at right angles two
parallel ridges of which one the more southern is composed of
secondary rocks and the other the more northern of primitive
rocks the latter presents nearly as far as the meridian of
carupano only mica-slate but to the east of this point where it
communicates by a transverse ridge (the sierra de meapire) with the
limestone range it contains lamellar gypsum compact limestone
and other rocks of secondary formation it might be supposed that
the southern ridge has transferred these rocks to the northern
chain

when standing on the summit of the cerro del meapire we see the
mountain currents flow on one side to the gulf of paria and on the
other to the gulf of cariaco east and west of the ridge there are
low and marshy grounds spreading out without interruption and if
it be admitted that both gulfs owe their origin to the sinking of
the earth and to rents caused by earthquakes we must suppose that
the cerro de meapire has resisted the convulsive movements of the
globe and hindered the waters of the gulf of paria from uniting
with those of the gulf of cariaco but for this rocky dyke the
isthmus itself in all probability would have had no existence and
from the castle of araya as far as cape paria the whole mass of
the mountains of the coast would have formed a narrow island
parallel to the island of santa margareta and four times as long
not only do the inspection of the ground and considerations
deduced from its relievo confirm these opinions but a mere glance
of the configuration of the coasts and a geological map of the
country would suggest the same ideas it would appear that the
island of margareta has been heretofore attached to the coast-chain
of araya by the peninsula of chacopata and the caribbee islands
lobo and coche in the same manner as this chain is still connected
with that of the cocollar and caripe by the ridge of meapire

at present we perceive that the humid plains which stretch east and
west of the ridge and which are improperly called the valleys san
bonifacio and cariaco are enlarging by gaining on the sea the
waters are receding and these changes of the shore are very
remarkable more particularly on the coast of cumana if the level
of the soil seem to indicate that the two gulfs of cariaco and
paria formerly occupied a much more considerable space we cannot
doubt that at present the land is progressively extending near
cumana a battery called la boca was built in 1791 on the very
margin of the sea in 1799 we saw it very far inland at the mouth
of the rio neveri near the morro of nueva barcelona the retreat
of the waters is still more rapid this local phenomenon is
probably assignable to accumulations of sand the progress of which
has not yet been sufficiently examined descending the sierra de
meapire which forms the isthmus between the plains of san
bonifacio and cariaco we find towards the east the great lake of
putacuao which communicates with the river areo and is four or
five leagues in diameter the mountainous lands that surround this
basin are known only to the natives there are found those great
boa serpents known to the chayma indians by the name of guainas
and to which they fabulously attribute a sting under the tail
descending the sierra de meapire to the west we find at first a
hollow ground (tierra hueca) which during the great earthquakes of
1766 threw out asphaltum enveloped in viscous petroleum farther
on a numberless quantity of sulphureous thermal springs* are seen
issuing from the soil (* el llano de aguas calientes
east-north-east of cariaco at the distance of two leagues) and
at length we reach the borders of the lake of campoma the
exhalations from which contribute to the insalubrity of the climate
of cariaco the natives believe that the hollow is formed by the
engulfing of the hot springs and judging from the sound heard
under the hoofs of the horses we must conclude that the
subterranean cavities are continued from west to east nearly as far
as casanay a length of three or four thousand toises a little
river the rio azul runs through these plains which are rent into
crevices by earthquakes these earthquakes have a particular centre
of action and seldom extend as far as cumana the waters of the
rio azul are cold and limpid they rise on the western declivity of
the mountain of meapire and it is believed that they are augmented
by infiltrations from the lake putacuao situated on the other side
of the chain the little river together with the sulphureous hot
springs fall into the laguna de campoma this is a name given to a
great lagoon which is divided in dry weather into three basins
situated north-west of the town of cariaco near the extremity of
the gulf fetid exhalations arise continually from the stagnant
water of this lagoon the smell of sulphuretted hydrogen is mingled
with that of putrid fishes and rotting plants

miasms are formed in the valley of cariaco as in the campagna of
rome but the hot climate of the tropics increases their
deleterious energy these miasms are probably ternary or quaternary
combinations of azote phosphorus hydrogen carbon and sulphur

the situation of the lagoon of campoma renders the north-west wind
which blows frequently after sunset very pernicious to the
inhabitants of the little town of cariaco its influence can be the
less doubted as intermitting fevers are observed to degenerate
into typhoid fevers in proportion as we approach the lagoon which
is the principal focus of putrid miasms whole families of free
negroes who have small plantations on the northern coast of the
gulf of cariaco languish in their hammocks from the beginning of
the rainy season these intermittent fevers assume a dangerous
character when persons debilitated by long labour and copious
perspiration expose themselves to the fine rains which frequently
fall as evening advances nevertheless the men of colour and
particularly the creole negroes resist much better than any other
race the influence of the climate lemonade and infusions of
scoparia dulcis are given to the sick but the cuspare which is
the cinchona of angostura is seldom used

it is generally observed that in these epidemics of the town of
cariaco the mortality is less considerable than might be supposed
intermitting fevers when they attack the same individual during
several successive years enfeeble the constitution but this state
of debility so common on the unhealthy coasts does not cause
death what is remarkable enough is the belief which prevails here
as in the campagna of rome that the air has become progressively
more vitiated in proportion as a greater number of acres have been
cultivated the miasms exhaled from these plains have however
nothing in common with those which arise from a forest when the
trees are cut down and the sun heats a thick layer of dead leaves
near cariaco the country is but thinly wooded can it be supposed
that the mould fresh stirred and moistened by rains alters and
vitiates the atmosphere more than the thick wood of plants which
covers an uncultivated soil? to local causes are joined other
causes less problematic the neighbouring shores of the sea are
covered with mangroves avicennias and other shrubs with
astringent bark all the inhabitants of the tropics are aware of
the noxious exhalations of these plants and they dread them the
more as their roots and stocks are not always under water but
alternately wetted and exposed to the heat of the sun* the
mangroves produce miasms because they contain vegeto-animal matter
combined with tannin (* the following is a list of the social
plants that cover those sandy plains on the sea-side and
characterize the vegetation of cumana and the gulf of cariaco
rhizophora mangle avicennia nitida gomphrena flava g brachiata
sesuvium portulacastrum (vidrio) talinum cuspidatum (vicho) t

the town of cariaco has been repeatedly sacked in former times by
the caribs its population has augmented rapidly since the
provincial authorities in spite of prohibitory orders from the
court of madrid have often favoured the trade with foreign
colonies the population amounted in 1800 to more than 6000
souls the inhabitants are active in the cultivation of cotton
which is of a very fine quality the capsules of the cotton-tree
when separated from the woolly substance are carefully burnt as
those husks if thrown into the river and exposed to putrefaction
yield noxious exhalations the culture of the cacao-tree has of
late considerably diminished this valuable tree bears only after
eight or ten years its fruit keeps very badly in the warehouses
and becomes mouldy at the expiration of a year notwithstanding all
the precautions employed for drying it

it is only in the interior of the province to the east of the
sierra de meapire that new plantations of the cacao-tree are seen
they become there the more productive as the lands newly cleared
and surrounded by forests are in contact with an atmosphere damp
stagnant and loaded with mephitic exhalations we there see
fathers of families attached to the old habits of the colonists
slowly amass a little fortune for themselves and their children
thirty thousand cacao-trees will secure competence to a family for
a generation and a half if the culture of cotton and coffee have
led to the diminution of cacao in the province of caracas and in
the small valley of cariaco it must be admitted that this last
branch of colonial industry has in general increased in the
interior of the provinces of new barcelona and cumana the causes
of the progressive movement of the cacao-tree from west to east may
be easily conceived the province of caracas has been from a remote
period cultivated and in the torrid zone in proportion as a
country has been cleared it becomes drier and more exposed to the
winds these physical changes have been adverse to the propagation
of cacao-trees the plantations of which diminishing in the
province of caracas have accumulated eastward on a newly-cleared
and virgin soil the cacao of cumana is infinitely superior to that
of guayaquil the best is produced in the valley of san bonifacio
as the best cacao of new barcelona caracas and guatimala is that
of capiriqual uritucu and soconusco since the island of trinidad
has become an english colony the whole of the eastern extremity of
the province of cumana especially the coast of paria and the gulf
of the same name have changed their appearance foreigners have
settled there and have introduced the cultivation of the
coffee-tree the cotton-tree and the sugar-cane of otaheite the
population has greatly increased at carupano in the beautiful
valley of rio caribe at guira and at the new town of punta di
piedra built opposite spanish harbour in the island of trinidad
the soil is so fertile in the golfo triste that maize yields two
harvests in the year and produces three hundred and eighty fold
the quantity sown

early in the morning we embarked in a sort of narrow canoe called
a lancha in hopes of crossing the gulf of cariaco during the day
the motion of the waters resembles that of our great lakes when
they are agitated by the winds from the embarcadero to cumana the
distance is only twelve nautical leagues on quitting the little
town of cariaco we proceeded westward along the river of
carenicuar which in a straight line like an artificial canal
runs through gardens and plantations of cotton-trees on the banks
of the river of cariaco we saw the indian women washing their linen
with the fruit of the parapara (sapindus saponaria or soap-berry)
an operation said to be very injurious to the linen the bark of
the fruit produces a strong lather and the fruit is so elastic
that if thrown on a stone it rebounds three or four times to the
height of seven or eight feet being a spherical form it is
employed in making rosaries

after we embarked we had to contend against contrary winds the
rain fell in torrents and the thunder rolled very near swarms of
flamingoes egrets and cormorants filled the air seeking the
shore whilst the alcatras a large species of pelican alone
continued peaceably to fish in the middle of the gulf the gulf of
cariaco is almost everywhere forty-five or fifty fathoms deep but
at its eastern extremity near curaguaca along an extent of five
leagues the lead does not indicate more than three or four
fathoms here is found the baxo de la cotua a sand-bank which at
low-water appears like a small island the canoes which carry
provisions to cumana sometimes ground on this bank but always
without danger because the sea is never rough or heavy we crossed
that part of the gulf where hot springs gush from the bottom of the
sea it was flood-tide so that the change of temperature was not
very perceptible besides our canoe drove too much towards the
southern shore it may be supposed that strata of water must be
found of different temperatures according to the greater or less
depth and according as the mingling of the hot waters with those
of the gulf is accelerated by the winds and currents the existence
of these hot springs which we were assured raise the temperature
of the sea through an extent of ten or twelve thousand square
toises is a very remarkable phenomenon (* in the island of
guadaloupe there is a fountain of boiling water which rushes out
on the beach hot-water springs rise from the bottom of the sea in
the gulf of naples and near the island of palma in the
archipelago of the canary islands) proceeding from the promontory
of paria westward by irapa aguas calientes the gulf of cariaco
the brigantine and the valley of aragua as far as the snowy
mountains of merida a continued band of thermal waters is found in
an extent of 150 leagues

adverse winds and rainy weather forced us to go on shore at
pericantral a small farm on the south side of the gulf the whole
of this coast though covered with beautiful vegetation is almost
wholly uncultivated there are scarcely seven hundred inhabitants
and excepting in the village of mariguitar we saw only
plantations of cocoa-trees which are the olives of the country
this palm occupies on both continents a zone of which the mean
temperature of the year is not below 20 degrees* (* the cocoa-tree
grows in the northern hemisphere from the equator to latitude 28
degrees near the equator we find it from the plains to the height
of 700 toises above the level of the sea) it is like the
chamaerops of the basin of the mediterranean a true palm-tree of
the coast it prefers salt to fresh water and flourishes less
inland where the air is not loaded with saline particles than on
the shore when cocoa-trees are planted in terra firma or in the
missions of the orinoco at a distance from the sea a considerable
quantity of salt sometimes as much as half a bushel is thrown
into the hole which receives the nut among the plants cultivated
by man the sugar-cane the plantain the mammee-apple and
alligator-pear (laurus persea) alone have the property of the
cocoa-tree that of being watered equally well with fresh and salt
water this circumstance is favourable to their migrations and if
the sugarcane of the sea-shore yield a syrup that is a little
brackish it is believed at the same time to be better fitted for
the distillation of spirit than the juice produced from the canes
in inland situations

the cocoa-tree in the other parts of america is in general
cultivated around farm-houses and the fruit is eaten in the gulf
of cariaco it forms extensive plantations in a fertile and moist
ground the tree begins to bear fruit abundantly in the fourth
year but in dry soils it bears only at the expiration of ten
years the duration of the tree does not in general exceed eighty
or a hundred years and its mean height at that age is from seventy
to eighty feet this rapid growth is so much the more remarkable
as other palm-trees for instance the moriche* (* mauritia
flexuosa) and the palm of sombrero* (* corypha tectorum) the
longevity of which is very great frequently do not attain a
greater height than fourteen or eighteen feet in the space of sixty
years in the first thirty or forty years a cocoa-tree of the gulf
of cariaco bears every lunation a cluster of ten or fourteen nuts
all of which however do not ripen it may be reckoned that on an
average a tree produces annually a hundred nuts which yield eight
flascos* of oil (one flasco contains 70 or 80 cubic inches paris
measure) in provence an olive-tree thirty years old yields twenty
pounds or seven flascos of oil so that it produces something less
than a cocoa-tree there are in the gulf of cariaco plantations
(haciendas) of eight or nine thousand cocoa-trees they resemble
in their picturesque appearance those fine plantations of
date-trees near elche in murcia where over the superficies of
one square league there may be found upwards of 70000 palms the
cocoa-tree bears fruit in abundance till it is thirty or forty
years old after that age the produce diminishes and a trunk a
hundred years old without being altogether barren yields very
little in the town of cumana there is prepared a great quantity of
cocoa-nut oil which is limpid without smell and very fit for
burning the trade in this oil is not less active than that on the
coast of africa for palm-oil which is obtained from the elais
guineensis and is used as food i have often seen canoes arrive at
cumana laden with 3000 cocoa-nuts

we did not quit the farm of pericantral till after sunset the
south coast of the gulf presents a most fertile aspect while the
northern coast is naked dry and rocky in spite of this aridity
and the scarcity of rain of which sometimes none falls for the
space of fifteen months* the peninsula of araya like the desert
of canound in india produces patillas or water-melons weighing
from fifty to seventy pounds (* the rains appear to have been more
frequent at the beginning of the 16th century at any rate the
canon of granada (peter martyr d'anghiera) speaking in the year
1574 of the salt-works of araya or of haraia described in the
fifth chapter of this work mentions showers (cadentes imbres) as a
very common phenomenon the same author who died in 1526 affirms
that the indians wrought the salt-works before the arrival of the
spaniards they dried the salt in the form of bricks and our
writer even then discussed the geological question whether the
clayey soil of haraia contained salt-springs or whether it had
been impregnated with salt by the periodical inundations of the
ocean for ages) in the torrid zone the vapours contained by the
air form about nine-tenths of the quantity necessary to its
saturation and vegetation is maintained by the property which the
leaves possess of attracting the water dissolved in the atmosphere

at sunrise we saw the zamuro vultures* (* vultur aura) in flocks
of forty or fifty perched on the cocoa-trees these birds range
themselves in files to roost together like fowls they go to roost
long before sunset and do not awake till after the sun is above
the horizon this sluggishness seems as if it were shared in those
climates by the trees with pinnate leaves the mimosas and the
tamarinds close their leaves in a clear and serene sky
twenty-five or thirty-five minutes before sunset and unfold them
in the morning when the solar disk has been visible for an equal
space of time as i noticed pretty regularly the rising and setting
of the sun for the purpose of observing the effect of the mirage
or of the terrestrial refractions i was enabled to give continued
attention to the phenomena of the sleep of plants i found them the
same in the steppes where no irregularity of the ground
interrupted the view of the horizon it appears that accustomed
during the day to an extreme brilliancy of light the sensitive and
other leguminous plants with thin and delicate leaves are affected
in the evening by the smallest decline in the intensity of the
sun's rays so that for vegetation night begins there as with us
before the total disappearance of the solar disk but why in a
zone where there is scarcely any twilight do not the first rays of
the sun stimulate the leaves with the more strength as the absence
of light must have rendered them more susceptible? does the
humidity deposited on the parenchyma by the cooling of the leaves
which is the effect of the nocturnal radiation prevent the action
of the first rays of the sun? in our climates the leguminous
plants with irritable leaves awake during the twilight of the
morning before the sun appears


chapter 19

physical constitution and manners of the chaymas
their language
filiation of the nations which inhabit new andalucia
pariagotos seen by columbus

i did not wish to mingle with the narrative of our journey to the
missions of caripe any general considerations on the different
tribes of the indigenous inhabitants of new andalusia their
manners their languages and their common origin having returned
to the spot whence we set out i shall now bring into one point of
view these considerations which are so nearly connected with the
history of the human race as we advance into the interior of the
country these subjects will become even more interesting than the
phenomena of the physical world the north-east part of equinoctial
america terra firma and the banks of the orinoco resemble in
respect to the numerous races of people who inhabit them the
defiles of the caucasus the mountains of hindookho at the
northern extremity of asia beyond the tungouses and the tartare
settled at the mouth of the lena the barbarism which prevails
throughout these different regions is perhaps less owing to a
primitive absence of all kind of civilization than to the effects
of long degradation for most of the hordes which we designate
under the name of savages are probably the descendants of nations
highly advanced in cultivation how can we distinguish the
prolonged infancy of the human race (if indeed it anywhere
exists) from that state of moral degradation in which solitude
want compulsory misery forced migration or rigour of climate
obliterate even the traces of civilization? if everything connected
with the primitive state of man and the first population of a
continent could from its nature belong to the domain of history
we might appeal to the traditions of india according to the
opinion frequently expressed in the laws of menou and in the
ramajan savages were regarded as tribes banished from civilized
society and driven into the forests the word barbarian which we
have borrowed from the greeks and romans was possibly merely the
proper name of one of those rude hordes

in the new world at the beginning of the conquest the natives
were collected into large societies only on the ridge of the
cordilleras and the coasts opposite to asia the plains covered
with forests and intersected by rivers the immense savannahs
extending eastward and bounding the horizon were inhabited by
wandering hordes separated by differences of language and manners
and scattered like the remnants of a vast wreck in the absence of
all other monuments we may endeavour from the analogy of
languages and the study of the physical constitution of man to
group the different tribes to follow the traces of their distant
emigrations and to discover some of those family features by which
the ancient unity of our species is manifested

in the mountainous regions which we have just traversed in the
two provinces of cumana and new barcelona the natives or
primitive inhabitants still constitute about one-half of the
scanty population their number may be reckoned at sixty thousand
of which twenty-four thousand inhabit new andalusia this number is
very considerable when compared with that of the hunting nations
of north america but it appears small when we consider those
parts of new spain in which agriculture has existed more than eight
centuries for instance the intendencia of oaxaca which includes
the mixteca and the tzapoteca of the old mexican empire this
intendencia is one-third smaller than the two provinces of cumana
and barcelona yet it contains more than four hundred thousand
natives of pure copper-coloured race the indians of cumana do not
all live within the missions some are dispersed in the
neighbourhood of the towns along the coasts to which they are
attracted by the fisheries and some dwell in little farms on the
plains or savannahs the missions of the aragonese capuchins which
we visited alone contain fifteen thousand indians almost all of
the chayma race the villages however are less populous there
than in the province of barcelona their average population is only
between five or six hundred indians while more to the west in the
missions of the franciscans of piritu we find indian villages
containing two or three thousand inhabitants in computing at sixty
thousand the number of natives in the provinces of cumana and
barcelona i include only those who inhabit the mainland and not
the guayquerias of the island of margareta and the great mass of
the guaraunos who have preserved their independence in the islands
formed by the delta of the orinoco the number of these is
generally reckoned at six or eight thousand but this estimate
appears to me to be exaggerated except a few families of guaraunos
who roam occasionally in the marshy grounds called los morichales
and between the cano de manamo and the rio guarapiche
consequently on the continent itself there have not been for
these thirty years any indian savages in new andalusia

i use with regret the word savage because it implies a difference
of cultivation between the reduced indian living in the missions
and the free or independent indian a difference which is often
belied by fact in the forests of south america there are tribes of
natives peacefully united in villages and who render obedience to
chiefs* (* these chiefs bear the designations of pecannati apoto
or sibierne) they cultivate the plantain-tree cassava and
cotton on a tolerably extensive tract of ground and they employ
the cotton for weaving hammocks these people are scarcely more
barbarous than the naked indians of the missions who have been
taught to make the sign of the cross it is a common error in
europe to look on all natives not reduced to a state of
subjection as wanderers and hunters agriculture was practised on
the american continent long before the arrival of europeans it is
still practised between the orinoco and the river amazon in lands
cleared amidst the forests places to which the missionaries have
never penetrated it would be to imbibe false ideas respecting the
actual condition of the nations of south america to consider as
synonymous the denominations of 'christian' 'reduced' and
'civilized' and those of 'pagan' 'savage' and 'independent' the
reduced indian is often as little of a christian as the independent
indian is of an idolater both alike occupied by the wants of the
moment betray a marked indifference for religious sentiments and
a secret tendency to the worship of nature and her powers this
worship belongs to the earliest infancy of nations it excludes
idols and recognises no other sacred places than grottoes
valleys and woods

if the independent indians have nearly disappeared for a century
past northward of the orinoco and the apure that is from the
snowy mountains of merida to the promontory of paria it must not
thence be concluded that there are fewer natives at present in
those regions than in the time of the bishop of chiapa bartolomeo
de las casas in my work on mexico i have shown that it is
erroneous to regard as a general fact the destruction and
diminution of the indians in the spanish colonies there still
exist more than six millions of the copper-coloured race in both
americas and though numberless tribes and languages are either
extinct or confounded together it is beyond a doubt that within
the tropics in that part of the new world where civilization has
penetrated only since the time of columbus the number of natives
has considerably increased two of the carib villages in the
missions of piritu or of carony contain more families than four or
five of the settlements on the orinoco the state of society among
the caribbees who have preserved their independence at the sources
of the essequibo and to the south of the mountains of pacaraimo
sufficiently proves how much even among that fine race of men the
population of the missions exceeds in number that of the free and
confederate caribbees besides the state of the savages of the
torrid zone is not like that of the savages of the missouri the
latter require a vast extent of country because they live only by
hunting whilst the indians of spanish guiana employ themselves in
cultivating cassava and plantains a very little ground suffices to
supply them with food they do not dread the approach of the
whites like the savages of the united states who being
progressively driven back behind the alleghany mountains the ohio
and the mississippi lose their means of subsistence in proportion
as they find themselves reduced within narrow limits under the
temperate zone whether in the provincias internas of mexico or in
kentucky the contact of european colonists has been fatal to the
natives because that contact is immediate

these causes have no existence in the greater part of south
america agriculture within the tropics does not require great
extent of ground the whites advance slowly the religious orders
have founded their establishments between the domain of the
colonists and the territory of the free indians the missions may
be considered as intermediary states they have doubtless
encroached on the liberty of the natives but they have almost
everywhere tended to the increase of population which is
incompatible with the restless life of the independent indians as
the missionaries advance towards the forests and gain on the
natives the white colonists in their turn seek to invade in the
opposite direction the territory of the missions in this
protracted struggle the secular arm continually tends to withdraw
the reduced indian from the monastic hierarchy and the
missionaries are gradually superseded by vicars the whites and
the castes of mixed blood favoured by the corregidors establish
themselves among the indians the missions become spanish villages
and the natives lose even the remembrance of their natural
language such is the progress of civilization from the coasts
toward the interior a slow progress retarded by the passions of
man but nevertheless sure and steady

the provinces of new andalusia and barcelona comprehended under
the name of govierno de cumana at present include in their
population more than fourteen tribes those in new andalusia are
the chaymas guayqueries pariagotos quaquas aruacas caribbees
and guaraunos in the province of barcelona cumanagotos palenkas
caribbees piritus tomuzas topocuares chacopatas and guarivas
nine or ten of these fifteen tribes consider themselves to be of
races entirely distinct the exact number of the guaraunos who
make their huts on the trees at the mouth of the orinoco is
unknown the guayqueries in the suburbs of cumana and in the
peninsula of araya amount to two thousand among the other indian
tribes the chaymas of the mountains of caripe the caribs of the
southern savannahs of new barcelona and the cumanagotos in the
missions of piritu are most numerous some families of guaraunos
have been reduced and dwell in missions on the left bank of the
orinoco where the delta begins the languages of the guaraunos and
that of the caribs of the cumanagotos and of the chaymas are the
most general they seem to belong to the same stock and they
exhibit in their grammatical forms those affinities which to use
a comparison taken from languages more known connect the greek
the german the persian and the sanscrit

notwithstanding these affinities we must consider the chaymas the
guaraunos the caribbees the quaquas the aruacas or arrawaks and
the cumanagotos as different nations i would not venture to
affirm the same of the guayqueries the pariagotos the piritus
the tomuzas and the chacopatas the guayquerias themselves admit
the analogy between their language and that of the guaraunos both
are a littoral race like the malays of the ancient continent with
respect to the tribes who at present speak the cumanagota
caribbean and chayma tongues it is difficult to decide on their
first origin and their relations with other nations formerly more
powerful the historians of the conquest as well as the
ecclesiastics who have described the progress of the missions
continually confound like the ancients geographical denominations
with the names of races they speak of indians of cumana and of the
coast of paria as if the proximity of abode proved the identity of
origin they most commonly even give to tribes the names of their
chiefs or of the mountains or valleys they inhabit this
circumstance by infinitely multiplying the number of tribes gives
an air of uncertainty to all that the monks relate respecting the
heterogeneous elements of which the population of their missions
are composed how can we now decide whether the tomuza and piritu
be of different races when both speak the cumanagoto language
which is the prevailing tongue in the western part of the govierno
of cumana as the caribbean and the chayma are in the southern and
eastern parts a great analogy of physical constitution increases
the difficulty of these inquiries in the new continent a
surprising variety of languages is observed among nations of the
same origin and which european travellers scarcely distinguish by
their features while in the old continent very different races of
men the laplanders the finlanders and the estonians the
germanic nations and the hindoos the persians and the kurds the
tartar and mongol tribes speak languages the mechanism and roots
of which present the greatest analogy

the indians of the american missions are all agriculturists
excepting those who inhabit the high mountains they all cultivate
the same plants their huts are arranged in the same manner their
days of labour their work in the conuco of the community their
connexions with the missionaries and the magistrates chosen from
among themselves are all subject to uniform regulations
nevertheless (and this fact is very remarkable in the history of
nations) these analogous circumstances have not effaced the
individual features or the shades of character which distinguish
the american tribes we observe in the men of copper hue a moral
inflexibility a steadfast perseverance in habits and manners
which though modified in each tribe characterise essentially the
whole race these peculiarities are found in every region from the
equator to hudson's bay on the one hand and to the straits of
magellan on the other they are connected with the physical
organization of the natives but they are powerfully favoured by
the monastic system

there exist in the missions few villages in which the different
families do not belong to different tribes and speak different
languages societies composed of elements thus heterogeneous are
difficult to govern in general the monks have united whole
nations or great portions of the same nations in villages
situated near to each other the natives see only those of their
own tribe for the want of communication and the isolated state of
the people are essential points in the policy of the missionaries
the reduced chaymas caribs and tamanacs retain their natural
physiognomy whilst they have preserved their languages if the
individuality of man be in some sort reflected in his idioms these
in their turn re-act on his ideas and sentiments it is this
intimate connection between language character and physical
constitution which maintains and perpetuates the diversity of
nations that unfailing source of life and motion in the
intellectual world

the missionaries may have prohibited the indians from following
certain practices and observing certain ceremonies they may have
prevented them from painting their skin from making incisions on
their chins noses and cheeks they may have destroyed among the
great mass of the people superstitious ideas mysteriously
transmitted from father to son in certain families but it has been
easier for them to proscribe customs and efface remembrances than
to substitute new ideas in the place of the old ones

the indian of the mission is secure of subsistence and being
released from continual struggles against hostile powers from
conflicts with the elements and man he leads a more monotonous
life less active and less fitted to inspire energy of mind than
the habits of the wild or independent indian he possesses that
mildness of character which belongs to the love of repose not that
which arises from sensibility and the emotions of the soul the
sphere of his ideas is not enlarged where having no intercourse
with the whites he remains a stranger to those objects with which
european civilization has enriched the new world all his actions
seem prompted by the wants of the moment taciturn serious and
absorbed in himself he assumes a sedate and mysterious air when a
person has resided but a short time in the missions and is but
little familiarized with the aspect of the natives he is led to
mistake their indolence and the torpid state of their faculties
for the expression of melancholy and a meditative turn of mind

i have dwelt on these features of the indian character and on the
different modifications which that character exhibits under the
government of the missionaries with the view of rendering more
intelligible the observations which form the subject of the present
chapter i shall begin by the nation of the chaymas of whom more
than fifteen thousand inhabit the missions above noticed the
chayma nation which father francisco of pampeluna* began to reduce
to subjection in the middle of the seventeenth century (* the name
of this monk celebrated for his intrepidity is still revered in
the province he sowed the first seeds of civilization among these
mountains he had long been captain of a ship and before he became
a monk was known by the name of tiburtio redin) has the
cumanagotos on the west the guaraunos on the east and the
caribbees on the south their territory occupies a space along the
elevated mountains of the cocollar and the guacharo the banks of
the guarapiche of the rio colorado of the areo and of the cano
de caripe according to a statistical survey made with great care
by the father prefect there were in the missions of the aragonese
capuchins of cumana nineteen mission villages of which the oldest
was established in 1728 containing one thousand four hundred and
sixty-five families and six thousand four hundred and thirty-three
persons sixteen doctrina villages of which the oldest dates from
1660 containing one thousand seven hundred and sixty-six families
and eight thousand one hundred and seventy persons these missions
suffered greatly in 1681 1697 and 1720 from the invasions of the
caribbees (then independent) who burnt whole villages from 1730
to 1736 the population was diminished by the ravages of the
small-pox a disease always more fatal to the copper-coloured
indians than to the whites many of the guaraunos who had been
assembled together fled back again to their native marshes
fourteen old missions were deserted and have not been rebuilt

the chaymas are in general short of stature and thick-set their
shoulders are extremely broad and their chests flat their limbs
are well rounded and fleshy their colour is the same as that of
the whole american race from the cold table-lands of quito and new
grenada to the burning plains of the amazon it is not changed by
the varied influence of climate it is connected with organic
peculiarities which for ages past have been unalterably transmitted
from generation to generation if the uniform tint of the skin be
redder and more coppery towards the north it is on the contrary
among the chaymas of a dull brown inclining to tawny the
denomination of copper-coloured men could never have originated in
equinoctial america to designate the natives

the expression of the countenance of the chaymas without being
hard or stern has something sedate and gloomy the forehead is
small and but little prominent and in several languages of these
countries to express the beauty of a woman they say that 'she is
fat and has a narrow forehead' the eyes of the chaymas are black
deep-set and very elongated but they are neither so obliquely
placed nor so small as in the people of the mongol race the
corner of the eye is however raised up towards the temple the
eyebrows are black or dark brown thin and but little arched the
eyelids are edged with very long eyelashes and the habit of
casting them down as if from lassitude gives a soft expression to
the women and makes the eye thus veiled appear less than it really
is though the chaymas and in general all the natives of south
america and new spain resemble the mongol race in the form of the
eye in their high cheek-bones their straight and smooth hair and
the almost total absence of beard yet they essentially differ from
them in the form of the nose in the south americans this feature
is rather long prominent through its whole length and broad at
the nostrils the openings of which are directed downward as with
all the nations of the caucasian race their wide mouths with lips
but little protuberant though broad have generally an expression
of good nature the passage from the nose to the mouth is marked in
both sexes by two furrows which run diverging from the nostrils
towards the corners of the mouth the chin is extremely short and
round and the jaws are remarkable for strength and width

though the chaymas have fine white teeth like all people who lead
a very simple life they are however not so strong as those of
the negroes the habit of blackening the teeth from the age of
fifteen by the juices of certain herbs* and caustic lime
attracted the attention of the earliest travellers but the
practice has now fallen quite into disuse (* the early historians
of the conquest state that the blackening of the teeth was effected
by the leaves of a tree which the natives called hay and which
resembled the myrtle among nations very distant from each other
the pimento bears a similar name among the haitians aji or ahi
among the maypures of the orinoco ai some stimulant and aromatic
plants which mostly belonging to the genus capsicum were
designated by the same name) such have been the migrations of the
different tribes in these countries particularly since the
incursions of the spaniards who carried on the slave-trade that
it may be inferred the inhabitants of paria visited by christopher
columbus and by ojeda were not of the same race as the chaymas i
doubt much whether the custom of blackening the teeth was
originally suggested as gomara supposed by absurd notions of
beauty or was practised with the view of preventing the toothache
* this disorder is however almost unknown to the indians and the
whites suffer seldom from it in the spanish colonies at least in
the warm regions where the temperature is so uniform they are
more exposed to it on the back of the cordilleras at santa fe and
at popayan (* the tribes seen by the spaniards on the coast of
paria probably observed the practice of stimulating the organs of
taste by caustic lime as other races employed tobacco the chimo
the leaves of the coca or the betel this practice exists even in
our days but more towards the west among the guajiros at the
mouth of the rio de la hacha these indians still savage carry
small shells calcined and powdered in the husk of a fruit which
serves them as a vessel for various purposes suspended to their
girdle the powder of the guajiros is an article of commerce as
was anciently according to gomara that of the indians of paria
the immoderate habit of smoking also makes the teeth yellow and
blackens them but would it be just to conclude from this fact
that europeans smoke because we think yellow teeth handsomer than
white?)

the chaymas like almost all the native nations i have seen have
small slender hands their feet are large and their toes retain
an extraordinary mobility all the chaymas have a sort of family
look and this resemblance so often observed by travellers is the
more striking as between the ages of twenty and fifty difference
of years is no way denoted by wrinkles of the skin colour of the
hair or decrepitude of the body on entering a hut it is often
difficult among adult persons to distinguish the father from the
son and not to confound one generation with another i attribute
this air of family resemblance to two different causes the local
situation of the indian tribes and their inferior degree of
intellectual culture savage nations are subdivided into an
infinity of tribes which bearing violent hatred one to another
form no intermarriages even when their languages spring from the
same root and when only a small arm of a river or a group of
hills separates their habitations the less numerous the tribes
the more the intermarriages repeated for ages between the same
families tend to fix a certain similarity of conformation an
organic type which may be called national this type is preserved
under the system of the missions each mission being formed by a
single horde and marriages being contracted only between the
inhabitants of the same hamlet those ties of blood which unite
almost a whole nation are indicated in a simple manner in the
language of the indians born in the missions or by those who
after having been taken from the woods have learned spanish to
designate the individuals who belong to the same tribe they employ
the expression mis parientes my relations

with these causes common to all isolated classes and the effects
of which are observable among the jews of europe among the
different castes of india and among mountain nations in general
are combined some other causes hitherto unnoticed i have observed
elsewhere that it is intellectual culture which most contributes
to diversify the features barbarous nations have a physiognomy of
tribe or of horde rather than individuality of look or features
the savage and civilized man are like those animals of an
individual species some of which roam in the forest while others
associated with mankind share the benefits and evils which
accompany civilization varieties of form and colour are frequent
only in domestic animals how great is the difference with respect
to mobility of features and variety of physiognomy between dogs
which have again returned to the savage state in the new world and
those whose slightest caprices are indulged in the houses of the
opulent both in men and animals the emotions of the soul are
reflected in the features and the countenance acquires the habit
of mobility in proportion as the emotions of the mind are
frequent varied and durable but the indian of the missions
being remote from all cultivation influenced only by his physical
wants satisfying almost without difficulty his desires in a
favoured climate drags on a dull monotonous life the greatest
equality prevails among the members of the same community and this
uniformity this sameness of situation is pictured on the features
of the indians

under the system of the monks violent passions such as resentment
and anger agitate the native more rarely than when he lives in the
forest when man in a savage state yields to sudden and impetuous
emotions his physiognomy till then calm and unruffled changes
instantly to convulsive contortions his passion is transient in
proportion to its violence with the indians of the missions as i
have often observed on the orinoco anger is less violent less
earnest but of longer duration besides in every condition of
man it is not the energetic or the transient outbreaks of the
passions which give expression to the features it is rather that
sensibility of the soul which brings us continually into contact
with the external world multiplies our sufferings and our
pleasures and re-acts at once on the physiognomy the manners and
the language if the variety and mobility of the features embellish
the domain of animated nature we must admit also that both
increase by civilization without being solely produced by it in
the great family of nations no other race unites these advantages
in so high a degree as the caucasian or european it is only in
white men that the instantaneous penetration of the dermoidal
system by the blood can produce that slight change of the colour of
the skin which adds so powerful an expression to the emotions of
the soul "how can those be trusted who know not how to blush?"
says the european in his dislike of the negro and the indian we
must also admit that immobility of features is not peculiar to
every race of men of dark complexion it is much less marked in the
african than in the natives of america

the chaymas like all savage people who dwell in excessively hot
regions have an insuperable aversion to clothing the writers of
the middle ages inform us that in the north of europe articles of
clothing distributed by missionaries greatly contributed to the
conversion of the pagan in the torrid zone on the contrary the
natives are ashamed (as they say) to be clothed and flee to the
woods when they are compelled to cover themselves among the
chaymas in spite of the remonstrances of the monks men and women
remain unclothed within their houses when they go into the
villages they put on a kind of tunic of cotton which scarcely
reaches to the knees the men's tunics have sleeves but women and
young boys to the age of ten or twelve have the arms shoulders
and upper part of the breast uncovered the tunic is so shaped
that the fore-part is joined to the back by two narrow bands which
cross the shoulders when we met the natives out of the boundaries
of the mission we saw them especially in rainy weather stripped
of their clothes and holding their shirts rolled up under their
arms they preferred letting the rain fall on their bodies to
wetting their clothes the elder women hid themselves behind trees
and burst into loud fits of laughter when they saw us pass the
missionaries complain that in general the young girls are not more
alive to feelings of decency than the men ferdinand columbus*
relates that in 1498 his father found the women in the island of
trinidad without any clothing (* life of the adelantado
churchill's collection 1723 this life written after the year
1537 from original notes in the handwriting of christopher
columbus himself is the most valuable record of the history of his
discoveries it exists only in the italian and spanish translations
of alphonso de ulloa and gonzales barcia for the original carried
to venice in 1571 by the learned fornari has not been published
and is supposed to be lost napione della patria di colombo 1804
cancellieri sopra christ colombo 1809 ) while the men wore the
guayuco which is rather a narrow bandage than an apron at the
same period on the coast of paria young girls were distinguished
from married women either as cardinal bembo states by being
quite unclothed or according to gomara by the colour of the
guayuco this bandage which is still in use among the chaymas and
all the naked nations of the orinoco is only two or three inches
broad and is tied on both sides to a string which encircles the
waist girls are often married at the age of twelve and until they
are nine years old the missionaries allow them to go to church
unclothed that is to say without a tunic among the chaymas as
well as in all the spanish missions and the indian villages a pair
of drawers a pair of shoes or a hat are objects of luxury
unknown to the natives an indian servant who had been with us
during our journey to caripe and the orinoco and whom i brought to
france was so much struck on landing when he saw the ground
tilled by a peasant with his hat on that he thought himself in a
miserable country where even the nobles (los mismos caballeros)
followed the plough the chayma women are not handsome according
to the ideas we annex to beauty yet the young girls have a look of
softness and melancholy contrasting agreeably with the expression
of the mouth which is somewhat harsh and wild they wear their
hair plaited in two long tresses they do not paint their skin and
wear no other ornaments than necklaces and bracelets made of
shells birds' bones and seeds both men and women are very
muscular but at the same time fleshy and plump i saw no person
who had any natural deformity and i may say the same of thousands
of caribs muyscas and mexican and peruvian indians whom we
observed during the course of five years bodily deformities and
deviations from nature are exceedingly rare among certain races of
men especially those who have the epidermis highly coloured but i
cannot believe that they depend solely on the progress of
civilization a luxurious life or the corruption of morals in
europe a deformed or very ugly girl marries if she happen to have
a fortune and the children often inherit the deformity of the
mother in the savage state which is a state of equality no
consideration can induce a man to unite himself to a deformed
woman or one who is very unhealthy such a woman if she resist
the accidents of a restless and troubled life dies without
children we might be tempted to think that savages all appear
well-made and vigorous because feeble children die young for want
of care and only the strongest survive but these causes cannot
operate among the indians of the missions whose manners are like
those of our peasants or among the mexicans of cholula and
tlascala who enjoy wealth transmitted to them by ancestors more
civilized than themselves if in every state of cultivation the
copper-coloured race manifests the same inflexibility the same
resistance to deviation from a primitive type are we not forced to
admit that this peculiarity belongs in great measure to hereditary
organization to that which constitutes the race? with
copper-coloured men as with whites luxury and effeminacy weaken
the physical constitution and heretofore deformities were more
common at cuzco and tenochtitlan among the mexicans of the present
day who are all labourers leading the most simple lives
montezuma would not have found those dwarfs and humpbacks whom
bernal diaz saw waiting at his table when he dined* (* bernal diaz
hist verd de la nueva espana 1630) the custom of marrying very
young according to the testimony of the monks is no way
detrimental to population this precocious nubility depends on the
race and not on the influence of a climate excessively warm it is
found on the north-west coast of america among the esquimaux and
in asia among the kamtschatdales and the koriaks where girls of
ten years old are often mothers it may appear astonishing that
the time of gestation the duration of pregnancy never alters in a
state of health in any race or in any climate

the chaymas are almost without beard on the chin like the
tungouses and other nations of the mongol race they pluck out the
few hairs which appear but independently of that practice most of
the natives would be nearly beardless* (* physiologists would
never have entertained any difference of opinion respecting the
existence of the beard among the americans if they had considered
what the first historians of the conquest have said on this
subject for example pigafetta in 1519 in his journal preserved
in the ambrosian library at milan and published (in 1800) by
amoretti benzoni hist del mundo nuovo 1572 bembo hist venet
1557) i say most of them because there are tribes which as they
appear distinct from the others are more worthy of fixing our
attention such are in north america the chippewas visited by
mackenzie and the yabipaees near the toltec ruins at moqui with
bushy beards in south america the patagonians and the guaraunos
among these last are some who have hairs on the breast when the
chaymas instead of extracting the little hair they have on the
chin attempt to shave themselves frequently their beards grow i
have seen this experiment tried with success by young indians who
officiated at mass and who anxiously wished to resemble the
capuchin fathers their missionaries and masters the great mass of
the people however dislike the beard no less than the eastern
nations hold it in reverence this antipathy is derived from the
same source as the predilection for flat foreheads which is
evinced in so singular a manner in the statues of the aztec heroes
and divinities nations attach the idea of beauty to everything
which particularly characterizes their own physical conformation
their national physiognomy* (* thus in their finest statues the
greeks exaggerated the form of the forehead by elevating beyond
proportion the facial line) hence it ensues that among a people to
whom nature has given very little beard a narrow forehead and a
brownish red skin every individual thinks himself handsome in
proportion as his body is destitute of hair his head flattened
and his skin besmeared with annatto chica or some other
copper-red colour

the chaymas lead a life of singular uniformity they go to rest
very regularly at seven in the evening and rise long before
daylight at half-past four in the morning every indian has a fire
near his hammock the women are so chilly that i have seen them
shiver at church when the centigrade thermometer was not below 18
degrees the huts of the indians are extremely clean their
hammocks their reed mats their pots for holding cassava and
fermented maize their bows and arrows everything is arranged in
the greatest order men and women bathe every day and being almost
constantly unclothed they are exempted from that uncleanliness of
which the garments are the principal cause among the lower class of
people in cold countries besides a house in the village they have
generally in their conucos near some spring or at the entrance
of some solitary valley a small hut covered with the leaves of
the palm or plantain-tree though they live less commodiously in
the conuco they love to retire thither as often as they can the
irresistible desire the indians have to flee from society and
enter again on a nomad life causes even young children sometimes
to leave their parents and wander four or five days in the
forests living on fruits palm-cabbage and roots when travelling
in the missions it is not uncommon to find whole villages almost
deserted because the inhabitants are in their gardens or in the
forests (al monte) among civilized nations the passion for
hunting arises perhaps in part from the same causes the charm of
solitude the innate desire of independence the deep impression
made by nature whenever man finds himself in contact with her in
solitude

the condition of the women among the chaymas like that in all
semi-barbarous nations is a state of privation and suffering the
hardest labour devolves on them when we saw the chaymas return in
the evening from their gardens the man carried nothing but the
knife or hatchet (machete) with which he clears his way among the
underwood whilst the woman bending under a great load of
plantains carried one child in her arms and sometimes two other
children placed upon the load notwithstanding this inequality of
condition the wives of the indians of south america appear to be
in general happier than those of the savages of the north between
the alleghany mountains and the mississippi wherever the natives
do not live chiefly on the produce of the chase the women
cultivate maize beans and gourds and the men take no share in
the labours of the field in the torrid zone hunting tribes are
not numerous and in the missions the men work in the fields as
well as the women

nothing can exceed the difficulty experienced by the indians in
learning spanish to which language they have an absolute aversion
whilst living separate from the whites they have no ambition to be
called educated indians or to borrow the phrase employed in the
missions 'latinized indians' (indios muy latinos) not only among
the chaymas but in all the very remote missions which i afterwards
visited i observed that the indians experience vast difficulty in
arranging and expressing the most simple ideas in spanish even
when they perfectly understand the meaning of the words and the
turn of the phrases when a european questions them concerning
objects which have surrounded them from their cradles they seem to
manifest an imbecility exceeding that of infancy the missionaries
assert that this embarrassment is neither the effect of timidity
nor of natural stupidity but that it arises from the impediments
they meet with in the structure of a language so different from
their native tongue in proportion as man is remote from
cultivation the greater is his mental inaptitude it is not
therefore surprising that the isolated indians in the missions
should experience in the acquisition of the spanish language less
facility than indians who live among mestizoes mulattoes and
whites in the neighbourhood of towns nevertheless i have often
wondered at the volubility with which at caripe the native
alcalde the governador and the sergento mayor will harangue for
whole hours the indians assembled before the church regulating the
labours of the week reprimanding the idle or threatening the
disobedient those chiefs who are also of the chayma race and who
transmit the orders of the missionary speak all together in a loud
voice with marked emphasis but almost without action their
features remain motionless but their look is imperious and severe

these same men who manifest quickness of intellect and who were
tolerably well acquainted with the spanish were unable to connect
their ideas when in our excursions in the country around the
convent we put questions to them through the intervention of the
monks they were made to affirm or deny whatever the monks pleased
and that wily civility to which the least cultivated indian is no
stranger induced them sometimes to give to their answers the turn
that seemed to be suggested by our questions travellers cannot be
enough on their guard against this officious assent when they seek
to confirm their own opinions by the testimony of the natives to
put an indian alcalde to the proof i asked him one day whether he
did not think the little river of caripe which issues from the
cavern of the guacharo returned into it on the opposite side by
some unknown entrance after having ascended the slope of the
mountain the indian seemed gravely to reflect on the subject and
then answered by way of supporting my hypothesis "how else if it
were not so would there always be water in the bed of the river at
the mouth of the cavern?"

the chaymas are very dull in comprehending anything relating to
numerical facts i never knew one of these people who might not
have been made to say that he was either eighteen or sixty years of
age mr marsden observed the same peculiarity in the malays of
sumatra though they have been civilized more than five centuries
the chayma language contains words which express pretty large
numbers yet few indians know how to apply them and having felt
from their intercourse with the missionaries the necessity of so
doing the more intelligent among them count in spanish but
apparently with great effort of mind as far as thirty or perhaps
fifty the same persons however cannot count in the chayma
language beyond five or six it is natural that they should employ
in preference the words of a language in which they have been
taught the series of units and tens since learned europeans have
not disdained to study the structure of the idioms of america with
the same care as they study those of the semitic languages and of
the greek and latin they no longer attribute to the imperfection
of a language what belongs to the rudeness of the nation it is
acknowledged that almost everywhere the indian idioms display
greater richness and more delicate gradations than might be
supposed from the uncultivated state of the people by whom they are
spoken i am far from placing the languages of the new world in the
same rank with the finest languages of asia and europe but no one
of these latter has a more neat regular and simple system of
numeration than the quichua and the aztec which were spoken in
the great empires of cuzco and anahuac it is a mistake to suppose
that those languages do not admit of counting beyond four because
in villages where they are spoken by the poor labourers of peruvian
and mexican race individuals are found who cannot count beyond
that number the singular opinion that so many american nations
reckon only as far as five ten or twenty has been propagated by
travellers who have not reflected that according to the genius
of different idioms men of all nations stop at groups of five
ten or twenty units (that is the number of the fingers of one
hand or of both hands or of the fingers and toes together) and
that six thirteen or twenty are differently expressed by
five-one ten-three and feet-ten* (* savages to express great
numbers with more facility are in the habit of forming groups of
five ten or twenty grains of maize according as they reckon in
their language by fives tens or twenties) can it be said that
the numbers of the europeans do not extend beyond ten because we
stop after having formed a group of ten units?

the construction of the languages of america is so opposite to that
of the languages derived from the latin that the jesuits who had
thoroughly examined everything that could contribute to extend
their establishments introduced among their neophytes instead of
the spanish some indian tongues remarkable for their regularity
and copiousness such as the quichua and the guarani they
endeavoured to substitute these languages for others which were
poorer and more irregular in their syntax this substitution was
found easy the indians of the different tribes adopted it with
docility and thenceforward those american languages generalized
became a ready medium of communication between the missionaries and
the neophytes it would be a mistake to suppose that the
preference given to the language of the incas over the spanish
tongue had no other aim than that of isolating the missions and
withdrawing them from the influence of two rival powers the
bishops and civil governors the jesuits had other motives
independently of their policy for wishing to generalize certain
indian tongues they found in those languages a common tie easy to
be established between the numerous hordes which had remained
hostile to each other and had been kept asunder by diversity of
idioms for in uncultivated countries after the lapse of several
ages dialects often assume the form or at least the appearance
of mother tongues

when it is said that a dane learns the german and a spaniard the
italian or the latin more easily than they learn any other
language it is at first thought that this facility results from
the identity of a great number of roots common to all the germanic
tongues or to those of latin europe it is not considered that
with this resemblance of sounds there is another resemblance
which acts more powerfully on nations of a common origin language
is not the result of an arbitrary convention the mechanism of
inflections the grammatical constructions the possibility of
inversions all are the offspring of our own minds of our
individual organization there is in man an instinctive and
regulating principle differently modified among nations not of the
same race a climate more or less severe a residence in the
defiles of mountains or on the sea-coasts or different habits of
life may alter the pronunciation render the identity of the roots
obscure and multiply the number but all these causes do not
affect that which constitutes the structure and mechanism of
languages the influence of climate and of external circumstances
vanishes before the influence which depends on the race on the
hereditary and individual dispositions of men

in america (and this result of recent researches* (* see vater's
mithridates) is extremely important with respect to the history of
our species) from the country of the esquimaux to the banks of the
orinoco and again from these torrid regions to the frozen climate
of the straits of magellan mother-tongues entirely different in
their roots have if we may use the expression the same
physiognomy striking analogies of grammatical construction are
acknowledged not only in the more perfect languages as in that of
the incas the aymara the guarauno the mexican and the cora but
also in languages extremely rude idioms the roots of which do not
resemble each other more than the roots of the sclavonic and the
biscayan have those resemblances of internal mechanism which are
found in the sanscrit the persian the greek and the german
languages almost everywhere in the new world we recognize a
multiplicity of forms and tenses in the verb* (* in the greenland
language for example the multiplicity of the pronouns governed by
the verb produces twenty-seven forms for every tense of the
indicative mood it is surprising to find among nations now
ranking in the lowest degree of civilization this desire of
graduating the relations of time this superabundance of
modifications introduced into the verb to characterise the object
matarpa he takes it away mattarpet thou takest it away
mattarpatit he takes it away from thee mattarpagit i take away
from thee and in the preterite of the same verb mattara he has
taken it away mattaratit he has taken it away from thee this
example from the greenland language shows how the governed and the
personal pronouns form one compound in the american languages
with the root of the verb these slight differences in the form of
the verb according to the nature of the pronouns governed by it
is found in the old world only in the biscayan and congo languages
(vater mithridates william von humboldt on the basque language)
strange conformity in the structure of languages on spots so
distant and among three races of men so different the white
catalonians the black congos and the copper-coloured americans)
an ingenious method of indicating beforehand either by inflexion
of the personal pronouns which form the terminations of the verb
or by an intercalated suffix the nature and the relation of its
object and its subject and of distinguishing whether the object be
animate or inanimate of the masculine or the feminine gender
simple or in complex number it is on account of this general
analogy of structure it is because american languages which have
no words in common (for instance the mexican and the quichua)
resemble each other by their organization and form complete
contrasts to the languages of latin europe that the indians of the
missions familiarize themselves more easily with an american idiom
than with the spanish in the forests of the orinoco i have seen
the rudest indians speak two or three tongues savages of different
nations often communicate their ideas to each other by an idiom not
their own

if the system of the jesuits had been followed languages which
already occupy a vast extent of country would have become almost
general in terra firma and on the orinoco the caribbean and the
tamanac alone would now be spoken and in the south and south-west
the quichua the guarano the omagua and the araucan by
appropriating to themselves these languages the grammatical forms
of which are very regular and almost as fixed as those of the
greek and sanscrit the missionaries would place themselves in more
intimate connection with the natives whom they govern the
numberless difficulties which occur in the system of a mission
consisting of indians of ten or a dozen different nations would
disappear with the confusion of idioms those which are little
diffused would become dead languages but the indian in preserving
an american idiom would retain his individuality his national
character thus by peaceful means might be effected what the incas
began to establish by force of arms

how indeed can we be surprised at the little progress made by the
chaymas the caribbees the salives or the otomacs in the
knowledge of the spanish language when we recollect that one white
man one single missionary finds himself alone amidst five or six
hundred indians? and that it is difficult for him to establish
among them a governador an alcalde or a fiscal who may serve him
as an interpreter? if instead of the missionary system some other
means of civilization were substituted if instead of keeping the
whites at a distance they could be mingled with the natives
recently united in villages the american idioms would soon be
superseded by the languages of europe and the natives would
receive in those languages the great mass of new ideas which are
the fruit of civilization then the introduction of general
tongues such as that of the incas or the guaranos without doubt
would become useless but after having lived so long in the
missions of south america after having so closely observed the
advantages and the abuses of the system of the missionaries i may
be permitted to doubt whether that system could be easily
abandoned though it is doubtless very capable of being improved
and rendered more conformable with our ideas of civil liberty to
this it may be answered that the romans* succeeded in rapidly
introducing their language with their sovereignty into the country
of the gauls into boetica and into the province of africa (* for
the reason of this rapid introduction of latin among the gauls i
believe we must look into the character of the natives and the
state of their civilization and not into the structure of their
language the brown-haired celtic nations were certainly different
from the race of the light-haired germanic nations and though the
druid caste recalls to our minds one of the institutions of the
ganges this does not demonstrate that the idiom of the celts
belongs like that of the nations of odin to a branch of the
indo-pelasgic languages from analogy of structure and of roots
the latin ought to have penetrated more easily on the other side of
the danube than into gaul but an uncultivated state joined to
great moral inflexibility probably opposed its introduction among
the germanic nations) but the natives of these countries were not
savages they inhabited towns they were acquainted with the use
of money and they possessed institutions denoting a tolerably
advanced state of cultivation the allurement of commerce and a
long abode of the roman legions had promoted intercourse between
them and their conquerors we see on the contrary that the
introduction of the languages of the mother-countries was met by
obstacles almost innumerable wherever carthaginian greek or
roman colonies were established on coasts entirely barbarous in
every age and in every climate the first impulse of the savage is
to shun the civilized man

the language of the chayma indians was less agreeable to my ear
than the caribbee the salive and other languages of the orinoco
it has fewer sonorous terminations in accented vowels we are
struck with the frequent repetition of the syllables guaz ez
puec and pur these terminations are derived in part from the
inflexion of the verb to be and from certain prepositions which
are added at the ends of words and which according to the genius
of the american idioms are incorporated with them it would be
wrong to attribute this harshness of sound to the abode of the
chaymas in the mountains they are strangers to that temperate
climate they have been led thither by the missionaries and it is
well known that like all the inhabitants of warm regions they at
first dreaded what they called the cold of caripe i employed
myself with m bonpland during our abode at the hospital of the
capuchins in forming a small catalogue of chayma words i am aware
that languages are much more strongly characterised by their
structure and grammatical forms than by the analogy of their sounds
and of their roots and that the analogy of sounds is sometimes so
disguised in different dialects of the same tongue as not to be
recognizable for the tribes into which a nation is divided often
designate the same objects by words altogether heterogeneous hence
it follows that we readily fall into mistakes if neglecting the
study of the inflexions and consulting only the roots (for
instance in the words which designate the moon sky water and
earth) we decide on the absolute difference of two idioms from the
mere want of resemblance in sounds but while aware of this source
of error travellers would do well to continue to collect such
materials as may be within their reach if they do not make known
the internal structure and general arrangement of the edifice
they may point out some important parts

the three languages now most used in the provinces of cumana and
barcelona are the chayma the cumanagota and the caribbee they
have always been regarded in these countries as different idioms
and a dictionary of each has been written for the use of the
missions by fathers tauste ruiz-blanco and breton the
vocabulario y arte de la lengua de los indios chaymas has become
extremely scarce the few american grammars printed for the most
part in the seventeenth century passed into the missions and have
been lost in the forests the dampness of the air and the voracity
of insects* render the preservation of books almost impossible in
those regions (* the termites so well known in spanish america
under the name of comegen or 'devourer' is one of these
destructive insects) they are destroyed in a short space of time
notwithstanding every precaution that may be employed i had much
difficulty to collect in the missions and in the convents those
grammars of american languages which on my return to europe i
placed in the hands of severin vater professor and librarian at
the university of konigsberg they furnished him with useful
materials for his great work on the idioms of the new world i
omitted at the time to transcribe from my journal and
communicate to that learned gentleman what i had collected in the
chayma tongue since neither father gili nor the abbe hervas has
mentioned this language i shall here explain succinctly the result
of my researches

on the right bank of the orinoco south-east of the mission of
encaramada and at the distance of more than a hundred leagues from
the chaymas live the tamanacs (tamanacu) whose language is
divided into several dialects this nation formerly very powerful
is separated from the mountains of caripe by the orinoco by the
vast steppes of caracas and of cumana and by a barrier far more
difficult to surmount the nations of caribbean origin but
notwithstanding distance and the numerous obstacles in the way of
intercourse the language of the chayma indians is a branch of the
tamanac tongue the oldest missionaries of caripe are ignorant of
this curious fact because the capuchins of aragon seldom visit the
southern banks of the orinoco and scarcely know of the existence
of the tamanacs i recognized the analogy between the idiom of this
nation and that of the chayma indians long after my return to
europe in comparing the materials which i had collected with the
sketch of a grammar published in italy by an old missionary of the
orinoco without knowing the chaymas the abbe gili conjectured
that the language of the inhabitants of paria must have some
relation to the tamanac* (* vater has also advanced some
well-founded conjectures on the connexion between the tamanac and
caribbean tongues and those spoken on the north-east coast of south
america i may acquaint the reader that i have written the words
of the american languages according to the spanish orthography so
that the u should be pronounced oo the ch like ch in english etc
having during a great number of years spoken no other language than
the castilian i marked down the sounds according to the
orthography of that language and now i am afraid of changing the
value of these signs by substituting others no less imperfect it
is a barbarous practice to express like the greater part of the
nations of europe the most simple and distinct sounds by many
vowels or many united consonants while they might be indicated by
letters equally simple what a chaos is exhibited by the
vocabularies written according to english german french or
spanish notations a new essay which the illustrious author of the
travels in egypt m volney is about to publish on the analysis of
sounds found in different nations and on the notation of those
sounds according to a uniform system will lead to great progress
in the study of languages)

i will prove this connection by two means which serve to show the
analogy of idioms namely the grammatical construction and the
identity of words and roots the following are the personal
pronouns of the chaymas which are at the same time possessive
pronouns u-re i me eu-re thou thee teu-re he him in the
tamanac u-re i amare or anja thou iteu-ja he the radical of
the first and of third person is in the chayma u and teu* (* we
must not wonder at those roots which reduce themselves to a single
vowel in a language of the old continent the structure of which
is so artificially complicated (the biscayan) the family name
ugarte (between the waters) contains the u of ura (water) and arte
between the g is added for the sake of euphony) the same roots
are found in the tamanac

the verb to be is expressed in chayma by az on adding to the verb
the personal pronoun i (u from u-re) a g is placed for the sake
of euphony before the u as in guaz i am properly g-u-az as the
first person is known by an u the second is designated by an m
the third by an i maz thou art muerepuec araquapemaz? why art
thou sad? properly what for sad thou art punpuec topuchemaz thou
art fat in body properly flesh (pun) for (puec) fat (topuche) thou
art (maz) the possessive pronouns precede the substantive upatay
in my house properly my house in all the prepositions and the
negation pra are incorporated at the end as in the tamanac they
say in chayma ipuec with him properly him with euya to thee
or thee to epuec charpe guaz i am gay with thee properly thee
with gay i am ucarepra not as i properly i as not quenpotupra
quoguaz i do not know him properly him knowing not i am quenepra
quoguaz i have not seen him properly him seeing not i am in the
tamanac tongue acurivane means beautiful and acurivanepra
ugly not beautiful outapra there is no fish properly fish none
uteripipra i will not go properly i to go will not composed of
uteri* to go ipiri to choose and pra not (* in chayma
utechire i will go also properly i (u) to go (the radical ute
or because of the preceding vowel te) also (chere or ere or
ire) in utechire we find the tamanac verb to go uteri of which
ute is also the radical and ri the termination of the infinitive
in order to show that in chayma chere or ere indicates the adverb
also i shall cite from the fragment of a vocabulary in my
possession u-chere i also nacaramayre he said so also
guarzazere i carried also charechere to carry also in the
tamanac as in the chayma chareri signifies to carry) among the
caribbees whose language also bears some relation to the tamanac
though infinitely less than the chayma the negation is expressed
by an m placed before the verb amoyenlengati it is very cold and
mamoyenlengati it is not very cold in an analogous manner the
particle mna added to the tamanac verb not at the end but by
intercalation gives it a negative sense as taro to say
taromnar not to say

the verb to be very irregular in all languages is az or ats in
chayma and uochiri (in composition uac uatscha) in tamanac it
serves not only to form the passive but it is added also as by
agglutination to the radical of attributive verbs in a number of
tenses* (* the present in the tamanac jarer-bae-ure appears to
me nothing else then the verb bac or uac (from uacschiri to be )
added to the radical to carry jare (in the infinitive jareri) the
result of which is carrying to be i) these agglutinations remind
us of the employment in the sanscrit of the auxiliary verbs as and
bhu (asti and bhavati* (* in the branch of the germanic languages
we find bhu under the forms bim bist as in the forms vas vast
vesum (bopp page 138))) the latin of es and fu or fus* (*
hence fu-ero amav-issem amav-eram pos-sum (pot-sum)) the
biscayan of izan ucan and eguin there are certain points in
which idioms the most dissimilar concur one with another that
which is common in the intellectual organization of man is
reflected in the general structure of language and every idiom
however barbarous it may appear discloses a regulating principle
which has presided at its formation

the plural in tamanac is indicated in seven different ways
according to the termination of the substantive or according as it
designates an animate or inanimate object* (* tamanacu a tamanac
(plur tamanakemi) pongheme a spaniard (properly a man clothed)
pongamo spaniards or men clothed the plural in cne characterizes
inanimate objects for example cene a thing cenecne things
jeje a tree jejecne trees) in chayma the plural is formed as in
caribbee in on teure himself teurecon themselves tanorocon
those here montaonocon those below supposing that the
interlocutor is speaking of a place where he was himself present
miyonocon those below supposing he speaks of a place where he was
not present the chaymas have also the castilian adverbs aqui and
alla shades of difference which can be expressed only by
periphrasis in the idioms of germanic and latin origin

some indians who were acquainted with spanish assured us that
zis signified not only the sun but also the deity this appeared
to me the more extraordinary as among all other american nations
we find distinct words for god and the sun the carib does not
confound tamoussicabo the ancient of heaven with veyou the sun
even the peruvian though a worshipper of the sun raises his mind
to the idea of a being who regulates the movements of the stars
the sun in the language of the incas bears the name of inti* (*
in the quichua or language of the incas the sun is inti love
munay great veypul in sanscrit the sun indre love manya
great vipulo (vater mithridates tome 3 page 333) these are the
only examples of analogy of sound that have yet been noticed the
grammatical character of the two languages is totally different)
nearly the same as in sanscrit while god is called vinay huayna
the eternally young'* (* vinay always or eternal huayna in the
flower of age)

the arrangement of words in the chayma is similar to that found in
all the languages of both continents which have preserved a
certain primitive character the object is placed before the verb
the verb before the personal pronoun the object on which the
attention should be principally fixed precedes all the
modifications of that object the american would say liberty
complete love we instead of we love complete liberty thee with
happy am i instead of i am happy with thee there is something
direct firm demonstrative in these turns the simplicity of
which is augmented by the absence of the article may it be
presumed that with advancing civilization these nations left to
themselves would have gradually changed the arrangement of their
phrases? we are led to adopt this idea when we reflect on the
changes which the syntax of the romans has undergone in the
precise clear but somewhat timid languages of latin europe

the chayma like the tamanac and most of the american languages is
entirely destitute of certain letters as f b and d no word
begins with an l the same observation has been made on the mexican
tongue though it is overcharged with the syllables tli tla and
itl at the end or in the middle of words the chaymas substitute r
for l a substitution that arises from a defect of pronunciation
common in every zone* (* for example the substitution of r for l
characterizes the bashmurie dialect of the coptic language) thus
the caribbees of the orinoco have been transformed into galibi in
french guiana by confounding r with l and softening the c the
tamanac has made choraro and solalo of the spanish word soldado
(soldier) the disappearance of the f and b in so many american
idioms arises out of that intimate connection between certain
sounds which is manifested in all languages of the same origin
the letters f v b and p are substituted one for the other for
instance in the persian peder father (pater) burader* (*
whence the german bruder with the same consonants) brother
(frater) behar spring (ver) in greek phorton (forton) a
burthen pous (pous) a foot (fuss germ) in the same manner
with the americans f and b become p and d becomes t the chayma
pronounces patre tios atani aracapucha for padre dios adan
and arcabuz (harquebuss)

in spite of the relations just pointed out i do not think that the
chayma language can be regarded as a dialect of the tamanac as the
maitano cuchivero and crataima undoubtedly are there are many
essential differences and between the two languages there appears
to me to exist merely the same connection as is found in the
german the swedish and the english they belong to the same
subdivision of the great family of the tamanac caribbean and
arowak tongues as there exists no absolute measure of resemblance
between idioms the degrees of parentage can be indicated only by
examples taken from known tongues we consider those as being of
the same family which bear affinity one to the other as the
greek the german the persian and the sanscrit

some philologists have imagined on comparing languages that they
may all be divided into two classes of which some comparatively
perfect in their organization easy and rapid in their movements
indicate an interior development by inflexion while others more
rude and less susceptible of improvement present only a crude
assemblage of small forms or agglutinated particles each
preserving the physiognomy peculiar to itself when it is
separately employed this very ingenious view would be deficient in
accuracy were it supposed that there exist polysyllabic idioms
without any inflexion or that those which are organically
developed as by interior germs admit no external increase by means
of suffixes and affixes* (* even in the sanscrit several tenses
are formed by aggregation for example in the first future the
substantive verb to be is added to the radical in a similar manner
we find in the greek mach-eso if the s be not the effect of
inflexion and in latin pot-ero (bopp pages 26 and 66) these are
examples of incorporation and agglutination in the grammatical
system of languages which are justly cited as models of an interior
development by inflexion in the grammatical system of the american
tongues for example in the tamanac tarecschi i will carry is
equally composed of the radical ar (infin jareri to carry) and of
the verb ecschi (infin nocschiri to be) there hardly exists in
the american languages a triple mode of aggregation of which we
cannot find a similar and analogous example in some other language
that is supposed to develop itself only by inflexion) an increase
which we have already mentioned several times under the name of
agglutination or incorporation many things which appear to us at
present inflexions of a radical have perhaps been in their origin
affixes of which there have barely remained one or two consonants
in languages as in everything in nature that is organized nothing
is entirely isolated or unlike the farther we penetrate into their
internal structure the more do contrasts and decided characters
vanish it may be said that they are like clouds the outlines of
which do not appear well defined except when viewed at a distance

but though we may not admit one simple and absolute principle in
the classification of languages yet it cannot be decided that in
their present state some manifest a greater tendency to inflexion
others to external aggregation it is well known that the
languages of the indian pelasgic and german branch belong to the
first division the american idioms the coptic or ancient
egyptian and to a certain degree the semitic languages and the
biscayan to the second the little we have made known of the idiom
of the chaymas of caripe sufficiently proves that constant
tendency towards the incorporation or aggregation of certain forms
which it is easy to separate though from a somewhat refined
sentiment of euphony some letters have been dropped and others have
been added those affixes by lengthening words indicate the most
varied relations of number time and motion

when we reflect on the peculiar structure of the american
languages we imagine we discover the source of the opinion
generally entertained from the most remote time in the missions
that these languages have an analogy with the hebrew and the
biscayan at the convent of caripe as well as at the orinoco in
peru as well as in mexico i heard this opinion expressed
particularly by monks who had some vague notions of the semitic
languages did motives supposed to be favourable to religion give
rise to this extraordinary theory? in the north of america among
the choctaws and the chickasaws travellers somewhat credulous have
heard the strains of the hallelujah* of the hebrews (* l'escarbot
charlevoix and even adair (hist of the american indians 1775))
as according to the pundits the three sacred words of the
mysteries of the eleusis* (konx om pax) resound still in the
indies (* asiat res volume 5 ouvaroff on the eleusinian
mysteries 1816) i do not mean to suggest that the nations of
latin europe may have called whatever has a foreign physiognomy
hebrew or biscayan as for a long time all those monuments were
called egyptian which were not in the grecian or roman style i am
rather disposed to think that the grammatical system of the
american idioms has confirmed the missionaries of the sixteenth
century in their ideas respecting the asiatic origin of the nations
of the new world the tedious compilation of father garcia tratado
del origen de los indios* (* treatise on the origin of the
indians) is a proof of this the position of the possessive and
personal pronouns at the end of the noun and the verb as well as
the numerous tenses of the latter characterize the hebrew and the
other semitic languages some of the missionaries were struck at
finding the same peculiarities in the american tongues they did
not reflect that the analogy of a few scattered features does not
prove languages to belong to the same stock

it appears less astonishing that men who are well acquainted with
only two languages extremely heterogeneous the castilian and the
biscayan should have found in the latter a family resemblance to
the american languages the composition of words the facility with
which the partial elements are detected the forms of the verbs
and their different modifications may have caused and kept up this
illusion but we repeat an equal tendency towards aggregation or
incorporation does not constitute an identity of origin the
following are examples of the relations between the american and
biscayan languages idioms totally different in their roots

the diminutive of woman (aica) or of maypure indian is formed by

him beguia the eye and beguitsa to see aitagana towards the

disagreeable childishness

i may add to these examples some descriptive compounds which call
to mind the infancy of nations and strike us equally in the
american and biscayan languages by a certain ingenuousness of
expression in tamanac the wasp (uane-imu) father (im-de) of
honey (uane)* (* it may not be unnecessary here to acquaint the
reader that honey is produced by an insect of south america
belonging to or nearly allied to the wasp genus this honey
however possesses noxious qualities which are by some naturalists
attributed to the plant paulinia australis the juices of which are
collected by the insect) the toes ptarimucuru properly the sons

the chayma and tamanac verbs have an enormous complication of
tenses two presents four preterites three futures this
multiplicity characterises the rudest american languages astarloa
reckons in like manner in the grammatical system of the biscayan
two hundred and six forms of the verb those languages the
principal tendency of which is inflexion are to the common
observer less interesting than those which seem formed by
aggregation in the first the elements of which words are
composed and which are generally reduced to a few letters are no
longer recognisable these elements when isolated exhibit no
meaning the whole is assimilated and mingled together the
american languages on the contrary are like complicated machines
the wheels of which are exposed to view the mechanism of their
construction is visible we seem to be present at their formation
and we should pronounce them to be of very recent origin did we
not recollect that the human mind steadily follows an impulse once
given that nations enlarge improve and repair the grammatical
edifice of their languages according to a plan already determined
finally that there are countries whose languages institutions
and arts have remained unchanged we might almost say stereotyped
during the lapse of ages

the highest degree of intellectual development has been hitherto
found among the nations of the indian and pelasgic branch the
languages formed principally by aggregation seem themselves to
oppose obstacles to the improvement of the mind they are devoid of
that rapid movement that interior life to which the inflexion of
the root is favourable and which impart such charms to works of
imagination let us not however forget that a people celebrated
in remote antiquity a people from whom the greeks themselves
borrowed knowledge had perhaps a language the construction of
which recalls involuntarily that of the languages of america what
a structure of little monosyllabic and disyllabic forms is added to
the verb and to the substantive in the coptic language the
semi-barbarous chayma and tamanac have tolerably short abstract
words to express grandeur envy and lightness cheictivate uoite
and uonde but in coptic the word malice* metrepherpetou is
composed of five elements easy to be distinguished (* see on the
incontestable identity of the ancient egyptian and coptic and on
the particular system of synthesis of the latter language the
ingenious reflexions of m silvestre de sacy in the notice des
recherches de m etienne quatremere sur la litterature de l'epypte
) this compound signifies the quality (met) of a subject (reph)
which makes (er) the thing which is (pet) evil (ou) nevertheless
the coptic language has had its literature like the chinese the
roots of which far from being aggregated scarcely approach each
other without immediate contact we must admit that nations once
roused from their lethargy and tending towards civilization find
in the most uncouth languages the secret of expressing with
clearness the conceptions of the mind and of painting the emotions
of the soul don juan de la rea a highly estimable man who
perished in the sanguinary revolutions of quito imitated with
graceful simplicity some idylls of theocritus in the language of
the incas and i have been assured that excepting treatises on
science and philosophy there is scarcely any work of modern
literature that might not be translated into the peruvian

the intimate connection established between the natives of the new
world and the spaniards since the conquest have introduced a
certain number of american words into the castilian language some
of these words express things not unknown before the discovery of
the new world and scarcely recall to our minds at present their
barbarous origin* (* for example savannah and cannibal) almost
all belong to the language of the great antilles formerly termed
the language of haiti of quizqueja or of itis* (* the word itis
for haiti or st domingo (hispaniola) is found in the itinerarium
of bishop geraldini (rome 1631) "quum colonus itim insulam
cerneret") i shall confine myself to citing the words maiz
tabaco canoa batata cacique balsa conuco etc when the
spaniards after the year 1498 began to visit the mainland they
already had words* to designate the vegetable productions most
useful to man and common both to the islands and to the coasts of
cumana and paria (* the following are haitian words in their real
form which have passed into the castilian language since the end
of the 15th century many of them are not uninteresting to
descriptive botany ahi (capsicum baccatum) batata (convolvus
batatas) bihao (heliconia bihai) caimito (chrysophyllum caimito)
cahoba (swietenia mahagoni) jucca and casabi (jatropba manihot)
the word casabi or cassava is employed only for the bread made with
the roots of the jatropha (the name of the plant jucca was also
heard by americo vespucci on the coast of paria) age or ajes
(dioscorea alata) copei (clusia alba) guayacan (guaiacum
officinale) guajaba (psidium pyriferum) guanavano (anona
muricata) mani (arachis hypogaea) guama (inga) henequen (was
supposed from the erroneous accounts of the first travellers to be
an herb with which the haitians used to cut metals it means now
every kind of strong thread) hicaco (chrysobalanus icaco) maghei

liquor) macana (a large stick or club made with the petioles of a
palm-tree) tabaco (not the herb but the pipe through which it is
smoked) cacique (a chief) other american words now as much in
use among the creoles as the arabic words naturalized in the
spanish do not belong to the haitian tongue for example caiman
piragua papaja (carica) aguacate (persea) tarabita paramo abbe
gili thinks with some probability that they are derived from the
tongue of some people who inhabited the temperate climate between
coro the mountains of merida and the tableland of bogota (saggio
volume 3 page 228) how many celtic and german words would not
julius caesar and tacitus have handed down to us had the
productions of the northern countries visited by the romans
differed as much from the italian and roman as those of
equinoctial america) not satisfied with retaining these words
borrowed from the haitians they helped also to spread them all
over america (at a period when the language of haiti was already a
dead language) and to diffuse them among nations who were ignorant
even of the existence of the west india islands some words which
are in daily use in the spanish colonies are attributed
erroneously to the haitians banana is from the chaconese the
mbaja language arepa (bread of manioc or of the jatropha manihot)
and guayuco (an apron perizoma) are caribbee curiara (a very long
boat) is tamanac chinchorro (a hammock) and tutuma (the fruit of
the crescentia cujete or a vessel to contain a liquid) are chayma
words

i have dwelt thus long on considerations respecting the american
tongues because i am desirous of directing attention to the deep
interest attached to this kind of research this interest is
analogous to that inspired by the monuments of semi-barbarous
nations which are examined not because they deserve to be ranked
among works of art but because the study of them throws light on
the history of our species and the progressive development of our
faculties

it now remains for me to speak of the other indian nations
inhabiting the provinces of cumana and barcelona these i shall
only succinctly enumerate

1 the pariagotos or parias

it is thought that the terminations in goto as pariagoto
purugoto avarigoto acherigoto cumanagoto arinagoto
kirikirisgoto* (* the kirikirisgotos (or kirikiripas) are of dutch
guiana it is very remarkable that among the small brazilian
tribes who do not speak the language of the tupis the kiriris
notwithstanding the enormous distance of 650 leagues have several
tamanac words) imply a caribbean origin* (* in the tamanac
tongue which is of the same branch as the caribbean we find also
the termination goto as in anekiamgoto an animal often an analogy
in the termination of names far from showing an identity of race
only indicates that the names of the nations are borrowed from one
language) all these tribes excepting the purugotos of the rio
caura formerly occupied the country which has been so long under
the dominion of the caribbees namely the coasts of berbice and of
essequibo the peninsula of paria the plains of piritu and parima
by this last name the little-known country between the sources of
the cujuni the caroni and the mao is designated in the missions
the paria indians are mingled in part with the chaymas of cumana
others have been settled by the capuchins of aragon in the missions
of caroni for instance at cupapuy and alta-gracia where they
still speak their own language apparently a dialect between the
tamanac and the caribbee but it may be asked is the name parias
or pariagotos a name merely geographical? did the spaniards who
frequented these coasts from their first establishment in the
island of cubagua and in macarapana give the name of the
promontory of paria* to the tribe by which it was inhabited? (*
paria uraparia even huriaparia and payra are the ancient names
of the country written as the first navigators thought they heard
them pronounced it appears to me by no means probable that the
promontory of paria should derive its name from that of a cacique
uriapari celebrated for the manner in which he resisted diego
ordaz in 1530 thirty-two years after columbus had heard the name
of paria from the mouths of the natives themselves the orinoco at
its mouth had also the name of uriapari yuyapari or iyupari in
all these denominations of a great river of a shore and of a
rainy country i think i recognise the radical par signifying
water not only in the languages of these countries but also in
those of nations very distant from one another on the eastern and
western coasts of america the sea or great water is in the
caribbean maypure and brazilian languages parana in the
tamanac parava in upper guiana also the orinoco is called parava
in the peruvian or quichua i find rain para to rain parani
besides there is a lake in peru that has been very anciently
called paria (garcia origen de los indios page 292) i have
entered into these minute details concerning the word paria
because it has recently been supposed that some connection might be
traced between this word and the country of the hindoo caste called
the parias) this we will not positively affirm for the caribbees
themselves give the name of caribana to a country which they
occupied and which extended from the rio sinu to the gulf of
darien this is a striking example of identity of name between an
american nation and the territory it possessed we may conceive
that in a state of society where residence is not long fixed such
instances must be very rare

2 the guaraons or gu-ara-una almost all free and independent are
dispersed in the delta of the orinoco with the variously ramified
channels of which they alone are well acquainted the caribbees
call the guaraons u-ara-u they owe their independence to the
nature of their country for the missionaries in spite of their
zeal have not been tempted to follow them to the tree-tops the
guaraons in order to raise their abodes above the surface of the
waters at the period of the great inundations support them on the
hewn trunks of the mangrove-tree and of the mauritia palm-tree* (*
their manners have been the same from time immemorial cardinal
bembo described them at the beginning of the 16th century
"quibusdam in locis propter paludes incolae domus in arboribus
aedificant" (hist venet 1551) sir walter raleigh in 1595
speaks of the guaraons under the names of araottes trivitivas and
warawites these were perhaps the names of some tribes into which
the great guaraonese nation was divided (barrere essai sur l'hist
naturelle de la france equinoctiale)) they make bread of the
medullary flour of this palm-tree which is the sago of america
the flour bears the name of yuruma i have eaten it at the town of
st thomas in guiana and it was very agreeable to the taste
resembling rather the cassava-bread than the sago of india* (* m
kunth has combined together three genera of the palms calamus
sigus and mauritia in a new section the calameae) the indians
assured me that the trunks of the mauritia the tree of life so
much vaunted by father gumilla do not yield meal in any abundance
unless the palm-tree is cut down just before the flowers appear
thus too the maguey* (* agave americana the aloe of our gardens)
cultivated in new spain furnishes a saccharine liquor the wine
(pulque) of the mexicans only at the period when the plant shoots
forth its long stem by interrupting the blossoming nature is
obliged to carry elsewhere the saccharine or amylaceous matter
which would accumulate in the flowers of the maguey and in the
fruit of the mauritia some families of guaraons associated with
the chaymas live far from their native land in the missions of
the plains or llanos of cumana for instance at santa rosa de
ocopi five or six hundred of them voluntarily quitted their
marshes a few years ago and formed on the northern and southern
banks of the orinoco twenty-five leagues distant from cape barima
two considerable villages under the names of zacupana and imataca
when i made my journey in caripe these indians were still without
missionaries and lived in complete independence their excellent
qualities as boatmen their perfect knowledge of the mouths of the
orinoco and of the labyrinth of branches communicating with each
other give the guaraons a certain political importance they
favour that clandestine commerce of which the island of trinidad is
the centre the guaraons run with extreme address on muddy lands
where the european the negro or other indians except themselves
would not dare to walk and it is therefore commonly believed
that they are of lighter weight than the rest of the natives this
is also the opinion that is held in asia of the burat tartars the
few guaraons whom i saw were of middle size squat and very
muscular the lightness with which they walk in places newly dried
without sinking in when even they have no planks tied to their
feet seemed to me the effect of long habit though i sailed a
considerable time on the orinoco i never went so low as its mouth
future travellers who may visit those marshy regions will rectify
what i have advanced

3 the guaiqueries or guaikeri are the most able and most intrepid
fishermen of these countries these people alone are well
acquainted with the bank abounding with fish which surrounds the
islands of coche margareta sola and testigos a bank of more
than four hundred square leagues extending east and west from
maniquarez to the boca del draco the guaiqueries inhabit the
island of margareta the peninsula of araya and that suburb of
cumana which bears their name their language is believed to be a
dialect of that of the guaraons this would connect them with the
great family of the caribbee nations and the missionary gili is of
opinion that the language of the guaiqueries is one of the numerous
branches of the caribbean tongue* (* if the name of the port
pam-patar in the island of margareta be guaiquerean as we have
no reason to doubt it exhibits a feature of analogy with the
cumanagoto tongue which approaches the caribbean and tamanac in
terra firma in the piritu missions we find the village of
cayguapatar which signifies house of caygua) these affinities are
interesting because they lead us to perceive an ancient connection
between nations dispersed over a vast extent of country from the
mouth of the rio caura and the sources of the erevato in parima
to french guiana and the coasts of paria* (* are the guaiqueries
or o-aikeries now settled on the borders of the erevato and
formerly between the rio caura and the cuchivero near the little
town of alta gracia of a different origin from the guaikeries of
cumana? i know also in the interior of the country in the
missions of the piritus near the village of san juan evangelista
del guarive a ravine very anciently called guayquiricuar these
resemblances seem to prove migrations from the south-west towards
the coast the termination cuar found so often in cumanagoto and
caribbean names means a ravine as in guaymacuar (ravine of
lizards) pirichucuar (a ravine overshaded by pirichu or piritu
palm-trees) chiguatacuar (a ravine of land-shells) raleigh
describes the guaiqueries under the name of ouikeries he calls the
chaymas saimas changing (according to the caribbean
pronunciation) the ch into s)

4 the quaquas whom the tamanacs call mapoje are a tribe formerly
very warlike and allied to the caribbees it is a curious
phenomenon to find the quaquas mingled with the chaymas in the
missions of cumana for their language as well as the atura of
the cataracts of the orinoco is a dialect of the salive tongue
and their original abode was on the banks of the assiveru which
the spaniards call cuchivero they have extended their migrations
one hundred leagues to the north-east i have often heard them
mentioned on the orinoco above the mouth of the meta and what is
very remarkable it is asserted* that missionary jesuits have found
quaquas as far distant as the cordilleras of popayan (* vater tome
3 part 2 page 364 the name of quaqua is found on the coast of
guinea the europeans apply it to a horde of negroes to the east of
cape lahou) raleigh enumerates among the natives of the island of
trinidad the salives a people remarkable for their mild manners
they came from the orinoco and settled south of the quaquas
perhaps these two nations which speak almost the same language
travelled together towards the coasts

5 the cumanagotos or according to the pronunciation of the
indians cumanacoto are now settled westward of cumana in the
missions of piritu where they live by cultivating the ground they
number more than twenty-six thousand their language like that of
the palencas or palenques and guarivas is between the tamanac
and the caribbee but nearer to the former these are indeed idioms
of the same family but if we are to consider them as simple
dialects the latin must be also called a dialect of the greek and
the swedish a dialect of the german in considering the affinity of
languages one with another it must not be forgotten that these
affinities may be very differently graduated and that it would be
a source of confusion not to distinguish between simple dialects
and languages of the same family the cumanagotos the tamanacs
the chaymas the guaraons and the caribbees do not understand
each other in spite of the frequent analogy of words and of
grammatical structure exhibited in their respective idioms the
cumanagotos inhabited at the beginning of the sixteenth century
the mountains of the brigantine and of parabolata i am unable to
determine whether the piritus cocheymas chacopatas tomuzas and
topocuares now confounded in the same villages with the
cumanagotos and speaking their language were originally tribes of
the same nation the piritus take their name from the ravine
pirichucuar where the small thorny palm-tree* called piritu
grows in abundance (* caudice gracili aculeato foliis pinnatis
possibly of the genus aiphanes of willdenouw) the wood of this
tree which is excessively hard and little combustible serves to
make pipes on this spot the village of la concepcion de piritu was
founded in 1556 it is the chief settlement of the cumanagoto
missions known by the name of the misiones de piritu

6 the caribbees (carives) this name which was given them by the
first navigators is retained throughout all spanish america the
french and the germans have transformed it i know not why into
caraibes the people call themselves carina calina and callinago
i visited some caribbean missions in the llanos* (* i shall in
future use the word llanos (loca plana suppressing the p) without
adding the equivalent words pampas savannahs meadows steppes or
plains the country between the mountains of the coast and the left
bank of the orinoco constitutes the llanos of cumana barcelona
and caracas) on returning from my journey to the orinoco and i
shall merely mention that the galibes (caribi of cayenne) the
tuapocas and the cunaguaras who originally inhabited the plains
between the mountains of caripe (caribe) and the village of
maturin the jaoi of the island of trinidad and of the province of
cumana and perhaps also the guarivas allies of the palencas are
all tribes of the great caribbee nation

with respect to the other nations whose affinities of language with
the tamanac and caribbee have been mentioned they are not
necessarily to be considered as of the same race in asia the
nations of mongol origin differ totally in their physical
organisation from those of tartar origin such has been however
the intermixture of these nations that according to the able
researches of klaproth the tartar languages (branches of the
ancient oigour) are spoken at present by hordes incontestably of
mongol race neither the analogy nor the diversity of language
suffice to solve the great problem of the filiation of nations
they merely serve to point out probabilities the caribbees
properly speaking those who inhabit the missions of the cari in
the llanos of cumana the banks of the caura and the plains to the
north-east of the sources of the orinoco are distinguished by
their almost gigantic size from all the other nations i have seen
in the new continent must it on this account be admitted that the
caribbees are an entirely distinct race? and that the guaraons and
the tamanacs whose languages have an affinity with the caribbee
have no bond of relationship with them? i think not among the
nations of the same family one branch may acquire an extraordinary
development of organization the mountaineers of the tyrol and
salzburgh are taller than the other germanic races the samoiedes
of the altai are not so little and squat as those of the sea-coast
in like manner it would be difficult to deny that the galibis are
really caribbees and yet notwithstanding the identity of
languages how striking is the difference in their stature and
physical constitution

before cortez entered the capital of montezuma in 1521 the
attention of europe was fixed on the regions we have just
traversed in depicting the manners of the inhabitants of paria and
cumana it was thought that the manners of all the inhabitants of
the new continent were described this remark cannot escape those
who read the historians of the conquest especially the letters of
peter martyr of anghiera written at the court of ferdinand the
catholic these letters are full of ingenious observations upon
christopher columbus leo x and luther and are stamped by noble
enthusiasm for the great discoveries of an age so rich in
extraordinary events without entering into any detail on the
manners of the nations which have been so long confounded one with
another under the vague denomination of cumanians (cumaneses) it
appears to me important to clear up a fact which i have often heard
discussed in spanish america

the pariagotos of the present time are of a brown red colour as
are the caribbees the chaymas and almost all the nations of the
new world why do the historians of the sixteenth century affirm
that the first navigators saw white men with fair hair at the
promontory of paria? were they of the same race as those indians of
a less tawny hue whom m bonpland and myself saw at esmeralda
near the sources of the orinoco? but these indians had hair as
black as the otomacs and other tribes whose complexion is the
darkest were they albinos such as have been found heretofore in
the isthmus of panama? but examples of that degeneration are very
rare in the copper-coloured race and anghiera as well as gomara
speaks of the inhabitants of paria in general and not of a few
individuals both describe them as if they were people of germanic
origin* (* "aethiopes nigri crispi lanati pariae incolae albi
capillis oblongis protensis flavis" pet martyr ocean dec 50
lib 6 (edition 1574) "utriusque sexus indigenae albi veluti
nostrates praeter eos qui sub sole versantur" (the natives of
both sexes are as white as our people [spaniards] except those who
are exposed to the sun) ibid gomara speaking of the natives
seen by columbus at the mouth of the river of cumana says "las
donzellas eran amorosas desnudas y blancas (las de la casa) los
indios que van al campo estan negros del sol" (the young women are
engaging in their manners they wear no clothing and those who
live in the houses are white the indians who are much in the open
country are black from the effect of the sun) hist de los
indios cap 74 "los indios de paria son blancos y rubios" (the
indians of paria are white and red) garcia origen de los indios
1729 lib 4 cap 9) they call them 'whites with light hair' they
even add that they wore garments like those of the turks* (*
"they wear round their head a striped cotton handkerchief" ferd
columb cap 71 (churchill volume 2) was this kind of head-dress
taken for a turban? (garcia origen de los ind page 303) i am
surprised that people of these regions should have worn a
head-dress but what is more curious still pinzon in a voyage
which he made alone to the coast of paria the particulars of which
have been transmitted to us by peter martyr of anghiera professes
to have seen natives who were clothed "incolas omnes genu tenus
mares foeminas surarum tenus gossampinis vestibus amictos
simplicibus repererunt sed viros more turcorum insuto minutim
gossypio ad belli usum duplicibus" (the natives were clothed in
thin cotton garments the men's reaching to the knee and the
women's to the calf of the leg their war-dress was thicker and
closely stitched with cotton after the turkish manner) pet
martyr dec 2 lib 7 who were these people described as being
comparatively civilized and clothed with tunics (like those who
lived an the summit of the andes) and seen on a coast where
before and since the time of pinzon only naked men have ever been
seen?) gomara and anghiera wrote from such oral information as they
had been able to collect

these marvels disappear if we examine the recital which ferdinand
columbus drew up from his father's papers there we find simply
that "the admiral was surprised to see the inhabitants of paria
and those of the island of trinidad better made more civilized
(de buena conversacion) and whiter than the natives whom he had
previously seen"* (* churchill's collection volume 2 herrera
pages 80 83 84 munoz hist del nuevo mundo volume 1 "el color
era baxo como es regular en los indios pero mas clara que en las
islas reconocidas" (their colour was dark as is usual among the
indians but lighter than that of the people of the islands
previously known) the missionaries are accustomed to call those
indians who are less black less tawny whitish and even almost
white gumilla hist de l'orenoque volume 1 chapter 5 paragraph
2 such incorrect expressions may mislead those who are not
accustomed to the exaggerations in which travellers often indulge)
this certainly did not mean that the pariagotos are white the
lighter colour of the skin of the natives and the great coolness of
the mornings on the coast of paria seemed to confirm the fantastic
hypothesis which that great man had framed respecting the
irregularity of the curvature of the earth and the height of the
plains in this region which he regarded as the effect of an
extraordinary swelling of the globe in the direction of the
parallels of latitude amerigo vespucci (in his pretended first
voyage apparently written from the narratives of other navigators)
compares the natives to the tartar nations* (* vultu non multum
speciosi sunt quoniam latas facies tartariis adsimilatas habent
(their countenances are not handsome their cheek-bones being broad
like those of the tartars) americi vesputii navigatio prima in
gryn's orbis novus 1555) not in regard to their colour but on
account of the breadth of their faces and the general expression
of their physiognomy

but if it be certain that at the end of the fifteenth century
there were on the coast of cumana a few men with white skins as
there are in our days it must not thence be concluded that the
natives of the new world exhibit everywhere a similar organization
of the dermoidal system it is not less inaccurate to say that
they are all copper-coloured than to affirm that they would not
have a tawny hue if they were not exposed to the heat of the sun
or tanned by the action of the air the natives may be divided into
two very unequal portions with respect to numbers to the first
belong the esquimaux of greenland of labrador and the northern
coast of hudson's bay the inhabitants of behring's straits of the
peninsula of alaska and of prince william's sound the eastern and
western branches* of this polar race (* vater in mithridates
volume 3 egede krantz hearne mackenzie portlock chwostoff
davidoff resanoff merk and billing have described the great
family of these tschougaz-esquimaux) the esquimaux and the
tschougases though at the vast distance of eight hundred leagues
apart are united by the most intimate analogy of languages this
analogy extends even to the inhabitants of the north-east of asia
for the idiom of the tschouktsches* at the mouth of the anadir (* i
mean here only the tschouktsches who have fixed dwelling-places
for the wandering tschouktsches approach very near the koriaks)
has the same roots as the language of the esquimaux who inhabit the
coast of america opposite to europe the tschouktsches are the
esquimaux of asia like the malays that hyperborean race reside
only on the sea-coasts they are almost all smaller in stature than
the other americans and are quick lively and talkative their
hair is almost straight and black but their skin (and this is
very characteristic of the race which i shall designate under the
name of tschougaz-esquimaux) is originally whitish it is certain
that the children of the greenlanders are born white some retain
that whiteness and often in the brownest (the most tanned) the
redness of the blood is seen to appear on their cheeks* (* krantz
hist of greenland 1667 tome 1 greenland does not seem to have
been inhabited in the eleventh century at least the esquimaux
appeared only in the fourteenth coming from the west)

the second portion of the natives of america includes all those
nations which are not tschougaz-esquimaux beginning from cook's
river to the straits of magellan from the ugaljachmouzes and the
kinaese of mount st elias to the puelches and tehuelhets of the
southern hemisphere the men who belong to this second branch are
taller stronger more warlike and more taciturn than the others
they present also very remarkable differences in the colour of
their skin in mexico peru new grenada quito on the banks of
the orinoco and of the river amazon in every part of south america
which i have explored in the plains as well as on the coldest
table-lands the indian children of two or three months old have
the same bronze tint as is observed in adults the idea that the
natives may be whites tanned by the air and the sun could never
have occurred to a spanish inhabitant of quito or of the banks of
the orinoco in the north-east of america on the contrary we meet
with tribes among whom the children are white and at the age of
virility they acquire the bronze colour of the natives of mexico
and peru michikinakoua chief of the miamis had his arms and
those parts of his body not exposed to the sun almost white this
difference of hue between the parts covered and not covered is
never observed among the natives of peru and mexico even in
families who live much at their ease and remain almost constantly
within doors to the west of the miamis on the coast opposite to
asia among the kolouches and tchinkitans* of norfolk sound (*
between 54 and 58 degrees of latitude these white nations have
been visited successively by portlock marchand baranoff and
davidoff the tchinkitans or schinkit are the inhabitants of the
island of sitka vater mithridates volume 3 page 2 marchand
voyages volume 2) grown-up girls when they have gashed their
skin display the white hue of europeans this whiteness is found
also according to some accounts among the mountaineers of chile*
(* molina saggio sull' istoria nat del chile edition 2 page 293
may we believe the existence of those blue eyes of the boroas of
chile and guayanas of uruguay represented to us as nations of the
race of odin? azara voyage tome 2)

these facts are very remarkable and contrary to the opinion so
generally spread of the extreme conformity of organization among
the natives of america if we divide them into esquimaux and
non-esquimaux we readily admit that this classification is not
more philosophical than that of the ancients who saw in the whole
of the habitable world only celts and scythians greeks and
barbarians when however our purpose is to group numerous
nations we gain something by proceeding in the mode of exclusion
all we have sought to establish here is that in separating the
whole race of tschougaz-esquimaux there remain still among the
coppery-brown americans other races the children of which are
born white without our being able to prove by going back as far
as the history of the conquest that they have been mingled with
european blood this fact deserves to be cleared up by travellers
who may possess a knowledge of physiology and may have
opportunities of examining the brown children of the mexicans at
the age of two years as well as the white children of the miamis
and those hordes* on the orinoco (* these whitish tribes are the
guaycas the ojos and the maquiritares) who living in the most
sultry regions retain during their whole life and in the fulness
of their strength the whitish skin of the mestizoes

in man the deviations from the common type of the whole race are
apparent in the stature the physiognomy or the form of the body
rather than on the colour of the skin* (* the circumpolar nations
of the two continents are small and squat though of races entirely
different) it is not so with animals where varieties are found
more in colour than in form the hair of the mammiferous class of
animals the feathers of birds and even the scales of fishes
change their hue according to the lengthened influence of light
and darkness and the intensity of heat and cold in man the
colouring matter seems to be deposited in the epidermis by the
roots or the bulbs of the hair* (* adverting to the interesting
researches of m gaultier on the organisation of the human skin
john hunter observes that in several animals the colorating of the
hair is independent of that of the skin) and all sound
observations prove that the skin varies in colour from the action
of external stimuli on individuals and not hereditarily in the
whole race the esquimaux of greenland and the laplanders are
tanned by the influence of the air but their children are born
white we will not decide on the changes which nature may have
produced in a space of time exceeding all historical tradition
reason stops short in these matters when no longer under the
guidance of experience and analogy

all white-skinned nations begin their cosmogony by white men they
allege that the negroes and all tawny people have been blackened or
embrowned by the excessive heat of the sun this theory adopted by
the greeks* (* strabo liv 15) though it did not pass without
contradiction* (* onesicritus apud strabonem lib 15
alexander's expedition appears to have contributed greatly to fix
the attention of the greeks on the great question of the influence
of climates they had learned from the accounts of travellers that
in hindostan the nations of the south were of darker colour than
those of the north near the mountains and they supposed that they
were both of the same race) has been propagated even to our own
times buffon has repeated in prose what theodectes had expressed
in verse two thousand years before "that nations wear the livery
of the climate in which they live" if history had been written by
black nations they would have maintained what even europeans have
recently advanced* that man was originally black or of a very
tawny colour (* see the work of mr prichard abounding with
curious research "researches into the physical history of man
1813" page 239) and that mankind have become white in some
races from the effect of civilization and progressive
debilitation as animals in a state of domestication pass from
dark to lighter colours in plants and in animals accidental
varieties formed under our own eyes have become fixed and have
been propagated* (* for example the sheep with very short legs
called ancon sheep in connecticut and examined by sir everard
home this variety dates only from the year 1791) but nothing
proves that in the present state of human organization the
different races of black yellow copper-coloured and white men
when they remain unmixed deviate considerably from their primitive
type by the influence of climate of food and other external
agents

these opinions are founded on the authority of ulloa* (* "the
indians [americans] are of a copper-colour which by the action of
the sun and the air grows darker i must remark that neither heat
nor cold produces any sensible change in the colour so that the
indians of the cordilleras of peru are easily confounded with those
of the hottest plains and those who live under the line cannot be
distinguished by their colour from those who inhabit the fortieth
degree of north and south latitude" noticias americanas no
ancient author has so clearly stated the two forms of reasoning by
which we still explain in our days the differences of colour and
features among neighbouring nations as tacitus he makes a just
distinction between the influence of climate and hereditary
dispositions and like a philosopher persuaded of our profound
ignorance of the origin of things he leaves the question
undecided "habitus corporum varii atque ex eo argumenta seu
durante originis vi seu procurrentibus in diversa terris positio
coeli corporibus habitum dedit" agricola cap 2) that learned
writer saw the indians of chile of the andes of peru of the
burning coasts of panama and those of louisiana situated in the
northern temperate zone he had the good fortune to live at a
period when theories were less numerous and like me he was
struck by seeing the natives equally bronzed under the line in the
cold climate of the cordilleras and in the plains where
differences of colour are observed they depend on the race we
shall soon find on the burning banks of the orinoco indians with a
whitish skin durans originis vis est

second abode at cumana
earthquakes
extraordinary meteors

we remained a month longer at cumana employing ourselves in the
necessary preparations for our proposed visit to the orinoco and
the rio negro we had to choose such instruments as could be most
easily transported in narrow boats and to engage guides for an
inland journey of ten months across a country without
communication with the coasts the astronomical determination of
places being the most important object of this undertaking i felt
desirous not to miss the observation of an eclipse of the sun
which was to be visible at the end of october and in consequence i
preferred remaining till that period at cumana where the sky is
generally clear and serene it was now too late to reach the banks
of the orinoco before october and the high valleys of caracas
promised less favourable opportunities on account of the vapours
which accumulate round the neighbouring mountains

i was however near being compelled by a deplorable occurrence to
renounce or at least to delay for a long time my journey to the
orinoco on the 27th of october the day before the eclipse we
went as usual to take the air on the shore of the gulf and to
observe the instant of high water which in those parts is only
twelve or thirteen inches it was eight in the evening and the
breeze was not yet stirring the sky was cloudy and during a dead
calm it was excessively hot we crossed the beach which separates
the suburb of the guayqueria indians from the embarcadero i heard
some one walking behind us and on turning i saw a tall man of the
colour of the zambos naked to the waist he held almost over my
head a macana which is a great stick of palm-tree wood enlarged
to the end like a club i avoided the stroke by leaping towards the
left but m bonpland who walked on my right was less fortunate
he did not see the zambo so soon as i did and received a stroke
above the temple which levelled him with the ground we were
alone without arms half a league from any habitation on a vast
plain bounded by the sea the zambo instead of attacking me moved
off slowly to pick up m bonpland's hat which having somewhat
deadened the violence of the blow had fallen off and lay at some
distance alarmed at seeing my companion on the ground and for
some moments senseless i thought of him only i helped him to
raise himself and pain and anger doubled his strength we ran
toward the zambo who either from cowardice common enough in
people of this caste or because he perceived at a distance some
men on the beach did not wait for us but ran off in the direction
of the tunal a little thicket of cactus and arborescent avicennia
he chanced to fall in running and m bonpland who reached him
first seized him round the body the zambo drew a long knife and
in this unequal struggle we should infallibly have been wounded if
some biscayan merchants who were taking the air on the beach had
not come to our assistance the zambo seeing himself surrounded
thought no longer of defence he again ran away and we pursued him
through the thorny cactuses at length tired out he took shelter
in a cow-house whence he suffered himself to be quietly led to
prison

m bonpland was seized with fever during the night but being
endowed with great energy and fortitude and possessing that
cheerful disposition which is one of the most precious gifts of
nature he continued his labours the next day the stroke of the
macana had extended to the top of his head and he felt its effect
for the space of two or three months during the stay we made at
caracas when stooping to collect plants he was sometimes seized
with giddiness which led us to fear that an internal abscess was
forming happily these apprehensions were unfounded and the
symptoms at first alarming gradually disappeared the inhabitants
of cumana showed us the kindest interest it was ascertained that
the zambo was a native of one of the indian villages which surround
the great lake of maracaybo he had served on board a privateer
belonging to the island of st domingo and in consequence of a
quarrel with the captain he had been left on the coast of cumana
when the ship quitted the port having seen the signal which we had
fixed up for the purpose of observing the height of the tides he
had watched the moment when he could attack us on the beach but
why after having knocked one of us down was he satisfied with
simply stealing a hat? in an examination he underwent his answers
were so confused and stupid that it was impossible to clear up our
doubts sometimes he maintained that his intention was not to rob
us but that irritated by the bad treatment he had suffered on
board the privateer of st domingo he could not resist the desire
of attacking us when he heard us speak french justice is so tardy
in this country that prisoners of whom the jail is full may
remain seven or eight years without being brought to trial we
learnt therefore with some satisfaction that a few days after
our departure from cumana the zambo had succeeded in breaking out
of the castle of san antonio

on the day after this occurrence the 28th of october i was at
five in the morning on the terrace of our house making
preparations for the observation of the eclipse the weather was
fine and serene the crescent of venus and the constellation of
the ship so splendid from the disposition of its immense nebulae
were lost in the rays of the rising sun i had a complete
observation of the progress and the close of the eclipse i
determined the distance of the horns or the differences of
altitude and azimuth by the passage over the threads of the
quadrant the eclipse terminated at 2 hours 14 minutes 234 seconds
mean time at cumana

during a few days which preceded and followed the eclipse of the
sun very remarkable atmospherical phenomena were observable it
was what is called in those countries the season of winter that
is of clouds and small electrical showers from the 10th of
october to the 3rd of november at nightfall a reddish vapour
arose in the horizon and covered in a few minutes with a veil
more or less thick the azure vault of the sky saussure's
hygrometer far from indicating greater humidity often went back
from 90 to 83 degrees the heat of the day was from 28 to 32
degrees which for this part of the torrid zone is very
considerable sometimes in the midst of the night the vapours
disappeared in an instant and at the moment when i had arranged my
instruments clouds of brilliant whiteness collected at the zenith
and extended towards the horizon on the 18th of october these
clouds were so remarkably transparent that they did not hide stars
even of the fourth magnitude i could distinguish so perfectly the
spots of the moon that it might have been supposed its disk was
before the clouds the latter were at a prodigious height disposed
in bands and at equal distances as from the effect of electric
repulsions these small masses of vapour similar to those i saw
above my head on the ridge of the highest andes are in several
languages designated by the name of sheep when the reddish vapour
spreads lightly over the sky the great stars which in general at
cumana scarcely scintillate below 20 or 25 degrees did not retain
even at the zenith their steady and planetary light they
scintillated at all altitudes as after a heavy storm of rain* (*
i have not observed any direct relation between the scintillation
of the stars and the dryness of that part of the atmosphere open to
our researches i have often seen at cumana a great scintillation
of the stars of orion and sagittarius when saussure's hygrometer
was at 85 degrees at other times these same stars considerably
elevated above the horizon emitted a steady and planetary light
the hygrometer being at 90 or 93 degrees probably it is not the
quantity of vapour but the manner in which it is diffused and
more or less dissolved in the air which determines the
scintillation the latter is invariably attended with a coloration
of light it is remarkable enough that in northern countries at
a time when the atmosphere appears perfectly dry the scintillation
is most decided in very cold weather) it was curious that the
vapour did not affect the hygrometer at the surface of the earth i
remained a part of the night seated in a balcony from which i had
a view of a great part of the horizon in every climate i feel a
peculiar interest in fixing my eyes when the sky is serene on
some great constellation and seeing groups of vesicular vapours
appear and augment as around a central nucleus then
disappearing form themselves anew

after the 28th of october the reddish mist became thicker than it
had previously been the heat of the nights seemed stifling though
the thermometer rose only to 26 degrees the breeze which
generally refreshed the air from eight or nine o'clock in the
evening was no longer felt the atmosphere was burning hot and
the parched and dusty ground was cracked on every side on the 4th
of november about two in the afternoon large clouds of peculiar
blackness enveloped the high mountains of the brigantine and the
tataraqual they extended by degrees as far as the zenith about
four in the afternoon thunder was heard over our heads at an
immense height not regularly rolling but with a hollow and often
interrupted sound at the moment of the strongest electric
explosion at 4 hours 12 minutes there were two shocks of
earthquake which followed each other at the interval of fifteen
seconds the people ran into the streets uttering loud cries m
bonpland who was leaning over a table examining plants was almost
thrown on the floor i felt the shock very strongly though i was
lying in a hammock its direction was from north to south which is
rare at cumana slaves who were drawing water from a well more
than eighteen or twenty feet deep near the river manzanares heard
a noise like the explosion of a strong charge of gunpowder the
noise seemed to come from the bottom of the well a very curious
phenomenon though very common in most of the countries of america
which are exposed to earthquakes

a few minutes before the first shock there was a very violent blast
of wind followed by electrical rain falling in great drops i
immediately tried the atmospherical electricity by the electrometer
of volta the small balls separated four lines the electricity
often changed from positive to negative as is the case during
storms and in the north of europe even sometimes in a fall of
snow the sky remained cloudy and the blast of wind was followed
by a dead calm which lasted all night the sunset presented a
picture of extraordinary magnificence the thick veil of clouds was
rent asunder as in shreds quite near the horizon the sun
appeared at 12 degrees of altitude on a sky of indigo-blue its
disk was enormously enlarged distorted and undulated toward the
edges the clouds were gilded and fascicles of divergent rays
reflecting the most brilliant rainbow hues extended over the
heavens a great crowd of people assembled in the public square
this celestial phenomenon the earthquake the thunder which
accompanied it the red vapour seen during so many days all were
regarded as the effect of the eclipse

about nine in the evening there was another shock much slighter
than the former but attended with a subterraneous noise the
barometer was a little lower than usual but the progress of the
horary variations or small atmospheric tides was no way
interrupted the mercury was precisely at the minimum of height at
the moment of the earthquake it continued rising till eleven in
the evening and sank again till half after four in the morning
conformably to the law which regulates barometrical variations in
the night between the 3rd and 4th of november the reddish vapour
was so thick that i could not distinguish the situation of the
moon except by a beautiful halo of 20 degrees diameter

scarcely twenty-two months had elapsed since the town of cumana had
been almost totally destroyed by an earthquake the people regard
vapours which obscure the horizon and the subsidence of wind
during the night as infallible pregnostics of disaster we had
frequent visits from persons who wished to know whether our
instruments indicated new shocks for the next day and alarm was
great and general when on the 5th of november exactly at the same
hour as on the preceding day there was a violent gust of wind
attended by thunder and a few drops of rain no shock was felt
the wind and storm returned during five or six days at the same
hour almost at the same minute the inhabitants of cumana and of
many other places between the tropics have long since observed
that atmospherical changes which are to appearance the most
accidental succeed each other for whole weeks with astonishing
regularity the same phenomenon occurs in summer in the temperate
zone nor has it escaped the perception of astronomers who often
observe in a serene sky during three or four days successively
clouds which have collected at the same part of the firmament take
the same direction and dissolve at the same height sometimes
before sometimes after the passage of a star over the meridian
consequently within a few minutes of the same point of true time*
(* m arago and i paid a great deal of attention to this phenomenon
during a long series of observations made in the year 1809 and
1810 at the observatory of paris with the view of verifying the
declination of the stars)

the earthquake of the 4th of november the first i had felt made
the greater impression on me as it was accompanied with remarkable
meteorological variations it was moreover a positive movement
upward and downward and not a shock by undulation i did not then
imagine that after a long abode on the table-lands of quito and
the coasts of peru i should become almost as familiar with the
abrupt movements of the ground as we are in europe with the sound
of thunder in the city of quito we never thought of rising from
our beds when during the night subterraneous rumblings
(bramidos) which seem always to come from the volcano of
pichincha announced a shock the force of which however is
seldom in proportion to the intensity of the noise the
indifference of the inhabitants who bear in mind that for three
centuries past their city has not been destroyed readily
communicates itself to the least intrepid traveller it is not so
much the fear of the danger as the novelty of the sensation which
makes so forcible an impression when the effect of the slightest
earthquake is felt for the first time

from our infancy the idea of certain contrasts becomes fixed in
our minds water appears to us an element that moves earth a
motionless and inert mass these impressions are the result of
daily experience they are connected with everything that is
transmitted to us by the senses when the shock of an earthquake is
felt when the earth which we had deemed so stable is shaken on its
old foundations one instant suffices to destroy long-fixed
illusions it is like awakening from a dream but a painful
awakening we feel that we have been deceived by the apparent
stability of nature we become observant of the least noise we
mistrust for the first time the soil we have so long trod with
confidence but if the shocks be repeated if they become frequent
during several successive days the uncertainty quickly disappears
in 1784 the inhabitants of mexico were accustomed to hear the
thunder roll beneath their feet* (* los bramidos de guanazuato)
as it is heard by us in the region of the clouds confidence easily
springs up in the human breast on the coasts of peru we become
accustomed to the undulations of the ground as the sailor becomes
accustomed to the tossing of the ship caused by the motion of the
waves

the reddish vapour which at cumana had spread a mist over the
horizon a little before sunset disappeared after the 7th of
november the atmosphere resumed its former purity and the
firmament appeared at the zenith of that deep blue tint peculiar
to climates where heat light and a great equality of electric
charge seem all to promote the most perfect dissolution of water in
the air i observed on the night of the 7th the immersion of the
second satellite of jupiter the belts of the planet were more
distinct than i had ever seen them before

i passed a part of the night in comparing the intensity of the
light emitted by the beautiful stars which shine in the southern
sky i pursued this task carefully in both hemispheres at sea and
during my abode at lima at guayaquil and at mexico nearly half a
century has now elapsed since la caille examined that region of the
sky which is invisible in europe the stars near the south pole are
usually observed with so little perseverance and attention that
the greatest changes may take place in the intensity of their light
and their own motion without astronomers having the slightest
knowledge of them i think i have remarked changes of this kind in
the constellation of the crane and in that of the ship i compared
at first with the naked eye the stars which are not very distant
from each other for the purpose of classing them according to the
method pointed out by herschel in a paper read to the royal
society of london in 1796 i afterwards employed diaphragms
diminishing the aperture of the telescope and coloured and
colourless glasses placed before the eye-glass i moreover made use
of an instrument of reflexion calculated to bring simultaneously
two stars into the field of the telescope after having equalized
their light by receiving it with more or fewer rays at pleasure
reflected by the silvered part of the mirror i admit that these
photometric processes are not very precise but i believe the last
which perhaps had never before been employed might he rendered
nearly exact by adding a scale of equal parts to the moveable
frame of the telescope of the sextant it was by taking the mean of
a great number of valuations that i saw the relative intensity of
the light of the great stars decrease in the following manner
sirius canopus a centauri acherner b centauri fomalhaut
rigel procyon betelgueuse e of the great dog d of the great
dog a of the crane a of the peacock these experiments will
become more interesting when travellers shall have determined anew
at intervals of forty or fifty years some of those changes which
the celestial bodies seem to undergo either at their surface or
with respect to their distances from our planetary system

after having made astronomical observations with the same
instruments in our northern climates and in the torrid zone we
are surprised at the effect produced in the latter (by the
transparency of the air and the less extinction of light) on the
clearness with which the double stars the satellites of jupiter
or certain nebulae present themselves beneath a sky equally
serene in appearance it would seem as if more perfect instruments
were employed so much more distinct and well defined do the
objects appear between the tropics it cannot be doubted that at
the period when equinoctial america shall become the centre of
extensive civilization physical astronomy will make immense
improvements in proportion as the skies will be explored with
excellent glasses in the dry and hot climates of cumana coro and
the island of margareta i do not here mention the ridge of the
cordilleras because with the exception of some high and nearly
barren plains in mexico and peru the very elevated table-lands in
which the barometric pressure is from ten to twelve inches less
than at the level of the sea have a misty and extremely variable
climate the extreme purity of the atmosphere which constantly
prevails in the low regions during the dry season counterbalances
the elevation of site and the rarity of the air on the table-lands
the elevated strata of the atmosphere when they envelope the
ridges of mountains undergo rapid changes in their transparency

the night of the 11th of november was cool and extremely fine from
half after two in the morning the most extraordinary luminous
meteors were seen in the direction of the east m bonpland who
had risen to enjoy the freshness of the air perceived them first
thousands of bolides and falling stars succeeded each other during
the space of four hours their direction was very regular from
north to south they filled a space in the sky extending from due
east 30 degrees to north and south in an amplitude of 60 degrees
the meteors were seen to rise above the horizon at east-north-east
and at east to describe arcs more or less extended and to fall
towards the south after having followed the direction of the
meridian some of them attained a height of 40 degrees and all
exceeded 25 or 30 degrees there was very little wind in the low
regions of the atmosphere and that little blew from the east no
trace of clouds was to be seen m bonpland states that from the
first appearance of the phenomenon there was not in the firmament
a space equal in extent to three diameters of the moon which was
not filled every instant with bolides and falling stars the first
were fewer in number but as they were of different sizes it was
impossible to fix the limit between these two classes of phenomena
all these meteors left luminous traces from five to ten degrees in
length as often happens in the equinoctial regions the
phosphorescence of these traces or luminous bands lasted seven or
eight seconds many of the falling stars had a very distinct
nucleus as large as the disk of jupiter from which darted sparks
of vivid light the bolides seem to burst as by explosion but the
largest those from 1 to 1 degree 15 minutes in diameter
disappeared without scintillation leaving behind them
phosphorescent bands (trabes) exceeding in breadth fifteen or
twenty minutes the light of these meteors was white and not
reddish which must doubtless be attributed to the absence of
vapour and the extreme transparency of the air for the same
reason within the tropics the stars of the first magnitude have
at their rising a light decidedly whiter than in europe

almost all the inhabitants of cumana witnessed this phenomenon
because they had left their houses before four o'clock to attend
the early morning mass they did not behold these bolides with
indifference the oldest among them remembered that the great
earthquakes of 1766 were preceded by similar phenomena the
guaiqueries in the indian suburb alleged "that the bolides began to
appear at one o'clock and that as they returned from fishing in
the gulf they had perceived very small falling stars towards the
east" they assured us that igneous meteors were extremely rare on
those coasts after two o'clock in the morning

the phenomenon ceased by degrees after four o'clock and the
bolides and falling stars became less frequent but we still
distinguished some to north-east by their whitish light and the
rapidity of their movement a quarter of an hour after sunrise
this circumstance will appear less extraordinary when i mention
that in broad daylight in 1788 the interior of the houses in the
town of popayan was brightly illumined by an aerolite of immense
magnitude it passed over the town when the sun was shining
clearly about one o'clock m bonpland and myself during our
second residence at cumana after having observed on the 26th of
september 1800 the immersion of the first satellite of jupiter
succeeded in seeing the planet distinctly with the naked eye
eighteen minutes after the disk of the sun had appeared in the
horizon there was a very slight vapour in the east but jupiter
appeared on an azure sky these facts bear evidence of the extreme
purity and transparency of the atmosphere in the torrid zone the
mass of diffused light is the less in proportion as the vapours
are more perfectly dissolved the same cause which checks the
diffusion of the solar light diminishes the extinction of that
which emanates either from bolides from jupiter or from the moon
seen on the second day after its conjunction the 12th of november
was an extremely hot day and the hygrometer indicated a very
considerable degree of dryness for those climates the reddish
vapour clouded the horizon anew and rose to the height of 14
degrees this was the last time it appeared that year and i must
here observe that it is no less rare under the fine sky of cumana
than it is common at acapulco on the western coast of mexico

we did not neglect during the course of our journey from caracas
to the rio negro to enquire everywhere whether the meteors of the
12th of november had been perceived in a wild country where the
greater number of the inhabitants sleep in the open air so
extraordinary a phenomenon could not fail to be remarked unless it
had been concealed from observation by clouds the capuchin
missionary at san fernando de apure* (* north latitude 7 degrees
53 minutes 12 seconds west longitude 70 degrees 20 minutes) a
village situated amid the savannahs of the province of varinas the
franciscan monks stationed near the cataracts of the orinoco and at
maroa* (* north latitude 2 degrees 42 minutes 0 seconds west
longitude 70 degrees 21 minutes) on the banks of the rio negro
had seen numberless falling-stars and bolides illumine the heavens
maroa is south-west of cumana at one hundred and seventy-four
leagues distance all these observers compared the phenomenon to
brilliant fireworks and it lasted from three till six in the
morning some of the monks had marked the day in their rituals
others had noted it by the proximate festivals of the church
unfortunately none of them could recollect the direction of the
meteors or their apparent height from the position of the
mountains and thick forests which surround the missions of the
cataracts and the little village of maroa i presume that the
bolides were still visible at 20 degrees above the horizon on my
arrival at the southern extremity of spanish guiana at the little
fort of san carlos i found some portuguese who had gone up the
rio negro from the mission of st joseph of the maravitans they
assured me that in that part of brazil the phenomenon had been
perceived at least as far as san gabriel das cachoeiras
consequently as far as the equator itself* (* a little to the
north-west of san antonio de castanheiro i did not meet with any
persons who had observed this meteor at santa fe de bogota at
popayan or in the southern hemisphere at quito and peru perhaps
the state of the atmosphere so changeable in these western regions
prevented observation)

i was forcibly struck by the immense height which these bolides
must have attained to have rendered them visible simultaneously at
cumana and on the frontiers of brazil in a line of two hundred
and thirty leagues in length but what was my astonishment when
on my return to europe i learned that the same phenomenon had been
perceived on an extent of the globe of 64 degrees of latitude and
91 degrees of longitude at the equator in south america at
labrador and in germany i saw accidentally during my passage
from philadelphia to bordeaux* (* in the memoirs of the
pennsylvanian society) the corresponding observation of mr
ellicot (latitude 30 degrees 42) and upon my return from naples to
berlin i read the account of the moravian missionaries among the
esquimaux in the bibliothek of gottingen

the following is a succinct enumeration of the facts

first the fiery meteors were seen in the east and the
east-north-east at 40 degrees of elevation from 2 to 6 am at
cumana (latitude 10 degrees 27 minutes 52 seconds longitude 66
degrees 30 minutes) at porto cabello (latitude 10 degrees 6
minutes 52 seconds longitude 67 degrees 5 minutes) and on the
frontiers of brazil near the equator in longitude 70 degrees
west of the meridian of paris

second in french guiana (latitude 4 degrees 56 minutes longitude
54 degrees 35 minutes) "the northern part of the sky was suffused
with fire numberless falling-stars traversed the heavens during
the space of an hour and a half and shed so vivid a light that
those meteors might be compared to the blazing sheaves which shoot
out from fireworks" the knowledge of this fact rests upon the
highly trustworthy testimony of the count de marbois then living
in exile at cayenne a victim to his love of justice and of
rational constitutional liberty

third mr ellicot astronomer to the united states having
completed his trigonometric operations for the rectification of the
limits on the ohio being on the 12th of november in the gulf of
florida in latitude 25 degrees and longitude 81 degrees 50
minutes saw in all parts of the sky "as many meteors as stars
moving in all directions some appeared to fall perpendicularly
and it was expected every minute that they would drop into the
vessel" the same phenomenon was perceived upon the american
continent as far as latitude 30 degrees 42 minutes

fourth in labrador at nain (latitude 56 degrees 55 minutes) and
hoffenthal (latitude 58 degrees 4 minutes) in greenland at
lichtenau (latitude 61 degrees 5 minutes) and at new herrnhut
(latitude 64 degrees 14 minutes longitude 52 degrees 20 minutes)
the esquimaux were terrified at the enormous quantity of bolides
which fell during twilight at all points of the firmament and some
of which were said to be a foot broad

fifth in germany mr zeissing vicar of ittetsadt near weimar
(latitude 50 degrees 59 minutes longitude 9 degrees 1 minute
east) perceived on the 12th of november between the hours of six
and seven in the morning (half-past two at cumana) some
falling-stars which shed a very white light soon after in the
direction of south and south-west luminous rays appeared from four
to six feet long they were reddish and resembled the luminous
track of a sky-rocket during the morning twilight between the
hours of seven and eight the sky in the direction of south-west
was observed from time to time to be brightly illumined by white
lightning running in serpentine lines along the horizon at night
the cold increased and the barometer rose it is very probable
that the meteors might have been observed more to the east in
poland and in russia* (* in paris and in london the sky was
cloudy at carlsruhe before dawn lightning was seen in the
north-west and south-east on the 13th of november a remarkable
glare of light was seen at the same place in the south-east)

the distance from weimar to the rio negro is 1800 nautical leagues
and from the rio negro to herrnhut in greenland 1300 leagues
admitting that the same fiery meteors were seen at points so
distant from each other we must suppose that their height was at
least 411 leagues near weimar the appearance like sky-rockets was
observed in the south and south-east at cumana in the east and
east-north-east we may therefore conclude that numberless
aerolites must have fallen into the sea between africa and south
america westward of the cape verd islands but since the direction
of the bolides was not the same at labrador and at cumana why were
they not perceived in the latter place towards the north as at
cayenne? we can scarcely be too cautious on a subject on which
good observations made in very distant places are still wanting i
am rather inclined to think that the chayma indians of cumana did
not see the same bolides as the portuguese in brazil and the
missionaries in labrador but at the same time it cannot be doubted
(and this fact appears to me very remarkable) that in the new
world between the meridians of 46 and 82 degrees between the
equator and 64 degrees north at the same hour an immense number
of bolides and falling-stars were perceived and that those meteors
had everywhere the same brilliancy throughout a space of 921000
square leagues

astronomers who have lately been directing minute attention to
falling-stars and their parallaxes consider them as meteors
belonging to the farthest limits of our atmosphere between the
region of the aurora borealis and that of the lightest clouds* (*
according to the observations which i made on the ridge of the
andes at an elevation of 2700 toises on the moutons or little
white fleecy clouds it appeared to me that their elevation is
sometimes not less than 6000 toises above the level of the coast)
some have been seen which had not more than 14000 toises or
about five leagues of elevation the highest do not appear to
exceed thirty leagues they are often more than a hundred feet in
diameter and their swiftness is such that they dart in a few
seconds through a space of two leagues of some which have been
measured the direction was almost perpendicularly upward or
forming an angle of 50 degrees with the vertical line this
extremely remarkable circumstance has led to the conclusion that
falling-stars are not aerolites which after having hovered a long
time in space unite on accidentally entering into our atmosphere
and fall towards the earth* (* m chladni who at first considered
falling-stars to be aerolites subsequently abandoned that idea)

whatever may be the origin of these luminous meteors it is
difficult to conceive an instantaneous inflammation taking place in
a region where there is less air than in the vacuum of our
air-pumps and where (at the height of 25000 toises) the mercury
in the barometer would not rise to 0012 of a line we have
ascertained the uniform mixture of atmospheric air to be about 0
003 only to an elevation of 3000 toises consequently not beyond
the last stratum of fleecy clouds it may be admitted that in the
first revolutions of the globe gaseous substances which yet
remain unknown to us have risen towards that region through which
the falling-stars pass but accurate experiments made upon
mixtures of gases which have not the same specific gravity show
that there is no reason for supposing a superior stratum of the
atmosphere entirely different from the inferior strata gaseous
substances mingle and penetrate each other on the least movement
and a uniformity of their mixture may have taken place in the lapse
of ages unless we believe them to possess a repulsive action of
which there is no example in those substances we can subject to our
observations farther if we admit the existence of particular
aerial fluids in the inaccessible regions of luminous meteors of
falling-stars bolides and the aurora borealis how can we
conceive why the whole stratum of those fluids does not at once
ignite but that the gaseous emanations like the clouds occupy
only limited spaces? how can we suppose an electrical explosion
without some vapours collected together capable of containing
unequal charges of electricity in air the mean temperature of
which is perhaps 25 degrees below the freezing point of the
centigrade thermometer and the rarefaction of which is so
considerable that the compression of the electrical shock could
scarcely disengage any heat? these difficulties would in great part
be removed if the direction of the movement of falling-stars
allowed us to consider them as bodies with a solid nucleus as
cosmic phenomena (belonging to space beyond the limits of our
atmosphere) and not as telluric phenomena (belonging to our planet
only)

supposing the meteors of cumana to have been only at the usual
height at which falling-stars in general move the same meteors
were seen above the horizon in places more than 310 leagues distant
from each other* (* it was this circumstance that induced lambert
to propose the observation of falling-stars for the determination
of terrestrial longitudes he considered them to be celestial
signals seen at great distances) how great a disposition to
incandescence must have prevailed on the 12th november in the
higher regions of the atmosphere to have rendered during four
hours myriads of bolides and falling stars visible at the equator
in greenland and in germany

m benzenberg observes that the same cause which renders the
phenomenon more frequent has also an influence on the large size
of the meteors and the intensity of their light in europe the
greatest number of falling stars are seen on those nights on which
very bright ones are mingled with very small ones the periodical
nature of the phenomenon augments the interest it excites there
are months in which m brandes has reckoned in our temperate zone
only sixty or eighty falling-stars in one night and in other
months their number has risen to two thousand whenever one is
observed which has the diameter of sirius or of jupiter we are
sure of seeing the brilliant meteor succeeded by a great number of
smaller ones if the falling stars be very numerous during one
night it is probable that they will continue equally so during
several weeks it would seem that in the higher regions of the
atmosphere near that extreme limit where the centrifugal force is
balanced by gravity there exists at regular periods a particular
disposition for the production of bolides falling-stars and the
aurora borealis* (* ritter like several others makes a
distinction between bolides mingled with falling-stars and those
luminous meteors which enveloped in vapour and smoke explode with
great noise and let fall (chiefly in the day-time) aerolites the
latter certainly do not belong to our atmosphere) does the
periodical recurrence of this great phenomenon depend upon the
state of the atmosphere? or upon something which the atmosphere
receives from without while the earth advances in the ecliptic? of
all this we are still as ignorant as mankind were in the days of
anaxagoras

with respect to the falling-stars themselves it appears to me
from my own experience that they are more frequent in the
equinoctial regions than in the temperate zone and more frequent
above continents and near certain coasts than in the middle of
the ocean do the radiation of the surface of the globe and the
electric charge of the lower regions of the atmosphere (which
varies according to the nature of the soil and the positions of the
continents and seas) exert their influence as far as those heights
where eternal winter reigns? the total absence of even the smallest
clouds at certain seasons or above some barren plains destitute
of vegetation seems to prove that this influence can be felt as
far as five or six thousand toises high

a phenomenon analogous to that which appeared on the 12th of
november at cumana was observed thirty years previously on the
table-land of the andes in a country studded with volcanoes in
the city of quito there was seen in one part of the sky above the
volcano of cayamba such great numbers of falling-stars that the
mountain was thought to be in flames this singular sight lasted
more than an hour the people assembled in the plain of exido
which commands a magnificent view of the highest summits of the
cordilleras a procession was on the point of setting out from the
convent of san francisco when it was perceived that the blaze on
the horizon was caused by fiery meteors which ran along the skies
in all directions at the altitude of twelve or thirteen degrees


chapter 111

passage from cumana to la guayra
morro of nueva barcelona
cape codera
road from la guayra to caracas

on the 16th of november at eight in the evening we were under
sail to proceed along the coast from cumana to the port of la
guayra whence the inhabitants of the province of venezuela export
the greater part of their produce the passage is only a distance
of sixty leagues and it usually occupies from thirty-six to forty
hours the little coasting vessels are favoured at once by the wind
and by the currents which run with more or less force from east to
west along the coasts of terra firma particularly from cape paria
to the cape of chichibacoa the road by land from cumana to new
barcelona and thence to caracas is nearly in the same state as
that in which it was before the discovery of america the traveller
has to contend with the obstacles presented by a miry soil large
scattered rocks and strong vegetation he must sleep in the open
air pass through the valleys of the unare the tuy and the
capaya and cross torrents which swell rapidly on account of the
proximity of the mountains to these obstacles must be added the
dangers arising from the extreme insalubrity of the country the
very low lands between the sea-shore and the chain of hills
nearest the coast from the bay of mochima as far as coro are
extremely unhealthy but the last-mentioned town which is
surrounded by an immense wood of thorny cactuses owes its great
salubrity like cumana to its barren soil and the absence of rain

in returning from caracas to cumana the road by land is sometimes
preferred to the passage by sea to avoid the adverse current the
postman from caracas is nine days in performing this journey we
often saw persons who had followed him arrive at cumana ill of
nervous and miasmatic fevers the tree of which the bark* furnishes
a salutary remedy for those fevers (* cortex angosturae of our
pharmacopaeias the bark of the bonplandia trifoliata) grows in
the same valleys and upon the edge of the same forests which send
forth the pernicious exhalations m bonpland recognised the
cuspare in the vegetation of the gulf of santa fe situated between
the ports of cumana and barcelona the sickly traveller may
perchance repose in a cottage the inhabitants of which are
ignorant of the febrifuge qualities of the trees that shade the
surrounding valleys

having proceeded by sea from cumana to la guayra we intended to
take up our abode in the town of caracas till the end of the rainy
season from caracas we proposed to direct our course across the
great plains or llanos to the missions of the orinoco to go up
that vast river to the south of the cataracts as far as the rio
negro and the frontiers of brazil and thence to return to cumana
by the capital of spanish guiana commonly called on account of
its situation angostura or the strait we could not determine the
time we might require to accomplish a tour of seven hundred
leagues more than two-thirds of that distance having to be
traversed in boats the only parts of the orinoco known on the
coasts are those near its mouth no commercial intercourse is kept
up with the missions the whole of the country beyond the llanos is
unknown to the inhabitants of cumana and caracas some think that
the plains of calabozo covered with turf stretch eight hundred
leagues southward communicating with the steppes or pampas of
buenos ayres others recalling to mind the great mortality which
prevailed among the troops of iturriaga and solano during their
expedition to the orinoco consider the whole country south of the
cataracts of atures as extremely pernicious to health in a region
where travelling is so uncommon people seem to feel a pleasure in
exaggerating to strangers the difficulties arising from the
climate the wild animals and the indians nevertheless we
persisted in the project we had formed we could rely upon the
interest and solicitude of the governor of cumana don vicente
emparan as well as on the recommendations of the franciscan monks
who are in reality masters of the shores of the orinoco

fortunately for us one of those monks juan gonzales was at that
time in cumana this young monk who was only a lay-brother was
highly intelligent and full of spirit and courage he had the
misfortune shortly after his arrival on the coast to displease his
superiors upon the election of a new director of the missions of
piritu which is a period of great agitation in the convent of new
barcelona the triumphant party exercised a general retaliation
from which the lay-brother could not escape he was sent to
esmeralda the last mission of the upper orinoco famous for the
vast quantity of noxious insects with which the air is continually
filled fray juan gonzales was thoroughly acquainted with the
forests which extend from the cataracts towards the sources of the
orinoco another revolution in the republican government of the
monks had some years before brought him to the coast where he
enjoyed (and most justly) the esteem of his superiors he confirmed
us in our desire of examining the much-disputed bifurcation of the
orinoco he gave us useful advice for the preservation of our
health in climates where he had himself suffered long from
intermitting fevers we had the satisfaction of finding fray juan
gonzales at new barcelona on our return from the rio negro
intending to go from the havannah to cadiz he obligingly offered
to take charge of part of our herbals and our insects of the
orinoco but these collections were unfortunately lost with himself
at sea this excellent young man who was much attached to us and
whose zeal and courage might have rendered him very serviceable to
the missions of his order perished in a storm on the coast of
africa in 1801

the boat which conveyed us from cumana to la guayra was one of
those employed in trading between the coasts and the west india
islands they are thirty feet long and not more than three feet
high at the gunwale they have no decks and their burthen is
generally from two hundred to two hundred and fifty quintals
although the sea is extremely rough from cape codera to la guayra
and although the boats have an enormous triangular sail somewhat
dangerous in those gusts which issue from the mountain-passes no
instance has occurred during thirty years of one of these boats
being lost in the passage from cumana to the coast of caracas the
skill of the guaiqueria pilots is so great that accidents are very
rare even in the frequent trips they make from cumana to
guadaloupe or the danish islands which are surrounded with
breakers these voyages of 120 or 150 leagues in an open sea out
of sight of land are performed in boats without decks like those
of the ancients without observations of the meridian altitude of
the sun without charts and generally without a compass the
indian pilot directs his course at night by the pole-star and in
the daytime by the sun and the wind i have seen guaiqueries and
pilots of the zambo caste who could find the pole-star by the
direction of the pointers alpha and beta of the great bear and
they seemed to me to steer less from the view of the pole-star
itself than from the line drawn through these stars it is
surprising that at the first sight of land they can find the
island of guadaloupe santa cruz or porto rico but the
compensation of the errors of their course is not always equally
fortunate the boats if they fall to leeward in making land beat
up with great difficulty to the eastward against the wind and the
current

we descended rapidly the little river manzanares the windings of
which are marked by cocoa-trees as the rivers of europe are
sometimes bordered by poplars and old willows on the adjacent arid
land the thorny bushes on which by day nothing is visible but
dust glitter during the night with thousands of luminous sparks
the number of phosphorescent insects augments in the stormy season
the traveller in the equinoctial regions is never weary of admiring
the effect of those reddish and moveable fires which being
reflected by limpid water blend their radiance with that of the
starry vault of heaven

we quitted the shore of cumana as if it had long been our home
this was the first land we had trodden in a zone towards which my
thoughts had been directed from earliest youth there is a powerful
charm in the impression produced by the scenery and climate of
these regions and after an abode of a few months we seemed to have
lived there during a long succession of years in europe the
inhabitant of the north feels an almost similar emotion when he
quits even after a short abode the shores of the bay of naples the
delicious country between tivoli and the lake of nemi or the wild
and majestic scenery of the upper alps and the pyrenees yet
everywhere in the temperate zone the effects of vegetable
physiognomy afford little contrast the firs and the oaks which
crown the mountains of sweden have a certain family air in common
with those which adorn greece and italy between the tropics on
the contrary in the lower regions of both indies everything in
nature appears new and marvellous in the open plains and amid the
gloom of forests almost all the remembrances of europe are
effaced for it is vegetation that determines the character of a
landscape and acts upon the imagination by its mass the contrast
of its forms and the glow of its colours in proportion as
impressions are powerful and new they weaken antecedent
impressions and their force imparts to them the character of
duration i appeal to those who more sensible to the beauties of
nature than to the charms of society have long resided in the
torrid zone how dear how memorable during life is the land on
which they first disembarked a vague desire to revisit that spot
remains rooted in their minds to the most advanced age cumana and
its dusty soil are still more frequently present to my imagination
than all the wonders of the cordilleras beneath the bright sky of
the south the light and the magic of the aerial hues embellish a
land almost destitute of vegetation the sun does not merely
enlighten it colours the objects and wraps them in a thin vapour
which without changing the transparency of the air renders its
tints more harmonious softens the effects of the light and
diffuses over nature a placid calm which is reflected in our
souls to explain this vivid impression which the aspect of the
scenery in the two indies produces even on coasts but thinly
wooded it is sufficient to recollect that the beauty of the sky
augments from naples to the equator almost as much as from
provence to the south of italy

we passed at high water the bar formed at the mouth of the little
river manzanares the evening breeze gently swelled the waves in
the gulf of cariaco the moon had not risen but that part of the
milky way which extends from the feet of the centaur towards the
constellation of sagittarius seemed to pour a silvery light over
the surface of the ocean the white rock crowned by the castle of
san antonio appeared from time to time between the high tops of
the cocoa-trees which border the shore and we soon recognized the
coasts only by the scattered lights of the guaiqueria fishermen

we sailed at first to north-north-west approaching the peninsula
of araya we then ran thirty miles to west and west-south-west as
we advanced towards the shoal that surrounds cape arenas and
stretches as far as the petroleum springs of maniquarez we enjoyed
one of those varied sights which the great phosphorescence of the
sea so often displays in those climates bands of porpoises
followed our bark fifteen or sixteen of these animals swam at
equal distances from each other when turning on their backs they
struck the surface of the water with their broad tails they
diffused a brilliant light which seemed like flames issuing from
the depth of the ocean* (* see views of nature bohn's edition page
246) each band of porpoises ploughing the surface of the waters
left behind it a track of light the more striking as the rest of
the sea was not phosphorescent as the motion of an oar and the
track of the bark produced on that night but feeble sparks it is
natural to suppose that the vivid phosphorescence caused by the
porpoises was owing not only to the stroke of their tails but also
to the gelatinous matter that envelopes their bodies and is
detached by the shock of the waves

we found ourselves at midnight between some barren and rocky
islands which uprise like bastions in the middle of the sea and
form the group of the caracas and chimanas* (* there are three of
the caracas islands and eight of the chimanas) the moon was above
the horizon and lighted up these cleft rocks which are bare of
vegetation and of fantastic aspect the sea here forms a sort of
bay a slight inward curve of the land between cumana and cape
codera the islets of picua picuita caracas and boracha appear
like fragments of the ancient coast which stretches from bordones
in the same direction east and west the gulfs of mochima and santa
fe which will no doubt one day become frequented ports lie behind
those little islands the rents in the land the fracture and dip
of the strata all here denote the effects of a great revolution
possibly that which clove asunder the chain of the primitive
mountains and separated the mica-schist of araya and the island of
margareta from the gneiss of cape codera several of the islands
are visible at cumana from the terraces of the houses and they
produce according to the superposition of layers of air more or
less heated the most singular effects of suspension and mirage
the height of the rocks does not probably exceed one hundred and
fifty toises but at night when lighted by the moon they seem to
be of a very considerable elevation

it may appear extraordinary to find the caracas islands so distant
from the city of that name opposite the coast of the cumanagotos
but the denomination of caracas denoted at the beginning of the
conquest not a particular spot but a tribe of indians neighbours
of the tecs the taramaynas and the chagaragates as we came very
near this group of mountainous islands we were becalmed and at
sunrise small currents drifted us toward boracha the largest of
them as the rocks rise nearly perpendicular the shore is abrupt
and in a subsequent voyage i saw frigates at anchor almost touching
the land the temperature of the atmosphere became sensibly higher
whilst we were sailing among the islands of this little
archipelago the rocks heated during the day throw out at night
by radiation a part of the heat absorbed as the sun arose on the
horizon the rugged mountains projected their vast shadows on the
surface of the ocean the flamingoes began to fish in places where
they found in a creek calcareous rocks bordered by a narrow beach
all these islands are now entirely uninhabited but upon one of the
caracas are found wild goats of large size brown and extremely
swift our indian pilot assured us that their flesh has an
excellent flavour thirty years ago a family of whites settled on
this island where they cultivated maize and cassava the father
alone survived his children as his wealth increased he purchased
two black slaves and by these slaves he was murdered the goats
became wild but the cultivated plants perished maize in america
like wheat in europe connected with man since his first
migrations appears to be preserved only by his care we sometimes
see these nutritive gramina disseminate themselves but when left
to nature the birds prevent their reproduction by destroying the
seeds

we anchored for some hours in the road of new barcelona at the
mouth of the river neveri of which the indian (cumanagoto) name is
enipiricuar this river is full of crocodiles which sometimes
extend their excursions into the open sea especially in calm
weather they are of the species common in the orinoco and bear so
much resemblance to the crocodile of egypt that they have long
been confounded together it may easily be conceived that an
animal the body of which is surrounded with a kind of armour must
be nearly indifferent to the saltness of the water pigafetta
relates in his journal recently published at milan that he saw on
the shores of the island of borneo crocodiles which inhabit alike
land and sea these facts must be interesting to geologists since
attention has been fixed on the fresh-water formations and the
curious mixture of marine and fluviatile petrifactions sometimes
observed in certain very recent rocks

the port of barcelona has maintained a very active commerce since
1795 from barcelona is exported most of the produce of those vast
steppes which extend from the south side of the chain of the coast
as far as the orinoco and in which cattle of every kind are almost
as abundant as in the pampas of buenos ayres the commercial
industry of these countries depends on the demand in the west india
islands for salted provision oxen mules and horses the coasts
of terra firma being opposite to the island of cuba at a distance
of fifteen or eighteen days' sail the merchants of the havannah
prefer especially in time of peace obtaining their provision from
the port of barcelona to the risk of a long voyage in another
hemisphere to the mouth of the rio de la plata the situation of
barcelona is singularly advantageous for the trade in cattle the
animals have only three days' journey from the llanos to the port
while it requires eight or nine days to reach cumana on account of
the chain of mountains of the brigantine and the imposible

having landed on the right bank of the neveri we ascended to a
little fort called el morro de barcelona situated at the elevation
of sixty or seventy toises above the level of the sea the morro is
a calcareous rock which has been lately fortified

the view from the summit of the morro is not without beauty the
rocky island of boracha lies on the east the lofty promontory of
unare is on the west and below are seen the mouth of the river
neveri and the arid shores on which the crocodiles come to sleep
in the sun notwithstanding the extreme heat of the air for the
thermometer exposed to the reflection of the white calcareous
rock rose to 38 degrees we traversed the whole of the eminence a
fortunate chance led us to observe some very curious geological
phenomena which we again met with in the cordilleras of mexico
the limestone of barcelona has a dull even or conchoidal
fracture with very flat cavities it is divided into very thin
strata and exhibits less analogy with the limestone of cumanacoa
than with that of caripe forming the cavern of the guacharo it is
traversed by banks of schistose jasper* (kieselschiefer of werner
)* black with a conchoidal fracture and breaking into fragments
of a parallelopipedal figure this fossil does not exhibit those
little streaks of quartz so common in the lydian stone it is found
decomposed at its surface into a yellowish grey crust and it does
not act upon the magnet its edges a little translucid give it
some resemblance to the hornstone so common in secondary
limestones* (* in switzerland the hornstone passing into common
jasper is found in kidney-stones and in layers both in the alpine
and jura limestone especially in the former) it is remarkable
that we find the schistose jasper which in europe characterizes the
transition rocks* (the transition-limestone and schist) in a
limestone having great analogy with that of jura in the study of
formations which is the great end of geognosy the knowledge
acquired in the old and new worlds should be made to furnish
reciprocal aid to each other it appears that these black strata
are found also in the calcareous mountains of the island of
boracha* (* we saw some of it as ballast in a fishing boat at
punta araya its fragments might have been mistaken for basalt)
another jasper that known by the name of the egyptian pebble was
found by m bonpland near the indian village of curacatiche or
curacaguitiche fifteen leagues south of the morro of barcelona
when on our return from the orinoco we crossed the llanos and
approached the mountains on the coast this stone presented
yellowish concentric lines and bands on a reddish brown ground it
appeared to me that the round pieces of egyptian jasper belonged
also to the barcelona limestone yet according to m cordier the
fine pebbles of suez owe their origin to a breccia formation or
siliceous agglomerate

at the moment of our setting sail on the 19th of november at
noon i took some altitudes of the moon to determine the longitude
of the morro the difference of meridian between cumana and the
town of barcelona where i made a great number of astronomical
observations in 1800 is 34 minutes 48 seconds i found the dip of
the needle 4220 degrees the intensity of the forces was equal to
224 oscillations

from the morro of barcelona to cape codera the land becomes low
as it recedes southward and the soundings extend to the distance
of three miles beyond this we find the bottom at forty-five or
fifty fathoms the temperature of the sea at its surface was 259
degrees but when we were passing through the narrow channel which
separates the two piritu islands in three fathoms water the
thermometer was only 245 degrees the difference would perhaps be
greater if the current which runs rapidly westward stirred up
deeper water and if in a pass of such small width the land did
not contribute to raise the temperature of the sea the piritu
islands resemble those shoals which become visible when the tide
falls they do not rise more than eight or nine inches above the
mean height of the sea their surface is smooth and covered with
grass we might have thought we were gazing on some of our own
northern meadows the disk of the setting sun appeared like a globe
of fire suspended over the savannah and its last rays as they
swept the earth illumined the grass which was at the same time
agitated by the evening breeze in the low and humid parts of the
equinoctial zone even when the gramineous plants and reeds present
the aspect of a meadow a rich accessory of the picture is usually
wanting i allude to that variety of wild flowers which scarcely
rising above the grass seem as it were to lie upon a smooth bed
of verdure within the tropics the strength and luxury of
vegetation give such a development to plants that the smallest of
the dicotyledonous family become shrubs it would seem as if the
liliaceous plants mingling with the gramina assumed the place of
the flowers of our meadows their form is indeed striking they
dazzle by the variety and splendour of their colours but being too
high above the soil they disturb that harmonious proportion which
characterizes the plants of our european meadows nature has in
every zone stamped on the landscape the peculiar type of beauty
proper to the locality

we must not be surprised that fertile islands so near terra firma
are not now inhabited it was only at the early period of the
discovery and whilst the caribbees chaymas and cumanagotos were
still masters of the coast that the spaniards formed settlements
at cubagua and margareta when the natives were subdued or driven
southward in the direction of the savannahs the preference was
given to settlements on the continent where there was a choice of
land and where there were indians who might be treated like
beasts of burden had the little islands of tortuga blanquilla
and orchilla been situated in the group of the antilles they would
not have remained without traces of cultivation

vessels of heavy burthen pass between the main land and the most
southern of the piritu islands being very low their northern
point is dreaded by pilots who near the coast in those latitudes
when we found ourselves to westward of the morro of barcelona and
the mouth of the river unare the sea till then calm became
agitated and rough in proportion as we approached cape codera the
influence of that vast promontory is felt from afar in that part
of the caribbean sea the length of the passage from cumana to la
guayra depends on the degree of ease or difficulty with which cape
codera can be doubled beyond this cape the sea constantly runs so
high that we can scarcely believe we are near a coast where (from
the point of paria as far as cape san roman) a gale of wind is
never known on the 20th of november at sunrise we were so far
advanced that we might expect to double the cape in a few hours
we hoped to reach la guayra the same day but our indian pilot
being afraid of the privateers who were near that port thought it
would be prudent to make for land and anchor in the little harbour
of higuerote which we had already passed and await the shelter of
night to proceed on our voyage

on the 20th of november at nine in the morning we were at anchor in
the bay just mentioned situated westward of the mouth of the rio
capaya we found there neither village nor farm but merely two or
three huts inhabited by mestizo fishermen their livid hue and
the meagre condition of their children sufficed to remind us that
this spot is one of the most unhealthy of the whole coast the sea
has so little depth along these shores that even with the smallest
barks it is impossible to reach the shore without wading through
the water the forests come down nearly to the beach which is
covered with thickets of mangroves avicennias manchineel-trees
and that species of suriana which the natives call romero de la
mar* (* suriana maritima) to these thickets and particularly to
the exhalations of the mangroves the extreme insalubrity of the
air is attributed here as in other places in both indies on
quitting the boats and whilst we were yet fifteen or twenty toises
distant from land we perceived a faint and sickly smell which
reminded me of that diffused through the galleries of deserted
mines where the lights begin to be extinguished and the timber is
covered with flocculent byssus the temperature of the air rose to
34 degrees heated by the reverberation from the white sands which
form a line between the mangroves and the great trees of the
forest as the shore descends with a gentle slope small tides are
sufficient alternately to cover and uncover the roots and part of
the trunks of the mangroves it is doubtless whilst the sun heats
the humid wood and causes the fermentation as it were of the
ground of the remains of dead leaves and of the molluscs enveloped
in the drift of floating seaweed that those deleterious gases are
formed which escape our researches we observed that the
sea-water along the whole coast acquired a yellowish brown tint
wherever it came into contact with the mangrove trees

struck with this phenomenon i gathered at higuerote a considerable
quantity of branches and roots for the purpose of making some
experiments on the infusion of the mangrove on my arrival at
caracas the infusion in warm water had a brown colour and an
astringent taste it contained a mixture of extractive matter and
tannin the rhizophora the mistletoe the cornel-tree in short
all the plants which belong to the natural families of the
lorantheous and the caprifoliaceous plants have the same
properties the infusion of mangrove-wood kept in contact with
atmospheric air under a glass jar for twelve days was not sensibly
deteriorated in purity a little blackish flocculent sediment was
formed but it was attended by no sensible absorption of oxygen
the wood and roots of the mangrove placed under water were exposed
to the rays of the sun i tried to imitate the daily operations of
nature on the coasts at the rise of the tide bubbles of air were
disengaged and at the expiration of ten days they formed a volume
of thirty-three cubic inches they were a mixture of azotic gas and
carbonic acid nitrous gas scarcely indicated the presence of
oxygen* (* in a hundred parts there were eighty-four of nitrogen
fifteen of carbonic acid gas that the water had not absorbed and
one of oxygen) lastly i set the wood and the roots of the
mangrove thoroughly wetted to act on a given volume of atmospheric
air in a phial with a ground-glass stopple the whole of the oxygen
disappeared and far from being superseded by carbonic acid
lime-water indicated only 002 there was even a diminution of the
volume of air more than correspondent with the oxygen absorbed
these slight experiments led me to conclude that it is the
moistened bark and wood which act upon the atmosphere in the
forests of mangrove-trees and not the water strongly tinged with
yellow forming a distinct band along the coasts in pursuing the
different stages of the decomposition of the ligneous matter i
observed no appearance of a disengagement of sulphuretted hydrogen
to which many travellers attribute the smell perceived amidst
mangroves the decomposition of the earthy and alkaline sulphates
and their transition to the state of sulphurets may no doubt
favour this disengagement in many littoral and marine plants for
instance in the fuci but i am rather inclined to think that the
rhizophora the avicennia and the conocarpus augment the
insalubrity of the air by the animal matter which they contain
conjointly with tannin these shrubs belong to the three natural
families of the lorantheae the combretaceae and the pyrenaceae
in which the astringent principle abounds this principle
accompanies gelatin even in the bark of beech alder and
nut-trees

moreover a thick wood spreading over marshy grounds would diffuse
noxious exhalations in the atmosphere even though that wood were
composed of trees possessing in themselves no deleterious
properties wherever mangroves grow on the sea-shore the beach is
covered with infinite numbers of molluscs and insects these
animals love shade and faint light and they find themselves
sheltered from the shock of the waves amid the scaffolding of thick
and intertwining roots which rises like lattice-work above the
surface of the waters shell-fish cling to this lattice crabs
nestle in the hollow trunks and the seaweeds drifted to the coast
by the winds and tides remain suspended on the branches which
incline towards the earth thus maritime forests by the
accumulation of a slimy mud between the roots of the trees
increase the extent of land but whilst these forests gain on the
sea they do not enlarge their own dimensions on the contrary
their progress is the cause of their destruction mangroves and
other plants with which they live constantly in society perish in
proportion as the ground dries and they are no longer bathed with
salt water their old trunks covered with shells and half-buried
in the sand denote after the lapse of ages the path they have
followed in their migrations and the limits of the land which they
have wrested from the ocean

the bay of higuerote is favourably situated for examining cape
codera which is there seen in its full extent seven miles distant
this promontory is more remarkable for its size than for its
elevation being only about two hundred toises high it is
perpendicular on the north-west and east in these grand profiles
the dip of the strata appears to be distinguishable judging from
the fragments of rock found along the coast and from the hills
near higuerote cape codera is not composed of granite with a
granular texture but of a real gneiss with a foliated texture its
laminae are very broad and sometimes sinuous* (* dickflasriger
gneiss) they contain large nodules of reddish feldspar and but
little quartz the mica is found in superposed lamellae not
isolated the strata nearest the bay were in the direction of 60
degrees north-east and dipped 80 degrees to north-west these
relations of direction and of dip are the same at the great
mountain of the silla near caracas and to the east of maniquarez
in the isthmus of araya they seem to prove that the primitive
chain of that isthmus after having been ruptured or swallowed up
by the sea along a space of thirty-five leagues* (* between the
meridians of maniquarez and higuerote) appears anew in cape
codera and continues westward as a chain of the coast

i was assured that in the interior of the earth south of
higuerote limestone formations are found the gneiss did not act
upon the magnetic needle yet along the coast which forms a cove
near cape codera and which is covered with a fine forest i saw
magnetic sand mixed with spangles of mica deposited by the sea
this phenomenon occurs again near the port of la guayra possibly
it may denote the existence of some strata of hornblende-schist
covered by the waters in which schist the sand is disseminated
cape codera forms on the north an immense spherical segment a
shallow which stretches along its foot is known to navigators by
the name of the points of tutumo and of san francisco

the road by land from higuerote to caracas runs through a wild and
humid tract of country by the montana of capaya north of
caucagua and the valley of rio guatira and guarenas some of our
fellow-travellers determined on taking this road and m bonpland
also preferred it notwithstanding the continual rains and the
overflowing of the rivers it afforded him the opportunity of
making a rich collection of new plants* (* bauhinia ferruginea
brownea racemosa b ed inga hymenaeifolia i curiepensis (which
willdenouw has called by mistake i caripensis) etc) for my part
i continued alone with the guaiqueria pilot the voyage by sea for
i thought it hazardous to lose sight of the instruments which we
were to make use of on the banks of the orinoco

we set sail at night-fall the wind was unfavourable and we
doubled cape codera with difficulty the surges were short and
often broke one upon another the sea ran the higher owing to the
wind being contrary to the current till after midnight the
general motion of the waters within the tropics towards the west is
felt strongly on the coast during two-thirds of the year in the
months of september october and november the current often flows
eastward for fifteen or twenty days in succession and vessels on
their way from guayra to porto cabello have sometimes been unable
to stem the current which runs from west to east although they
have had the wind astern the cause of these anomalies is not yet
discovered the pilots think they are the effect of gales of wind
from the north-west in the gulf of mexico

on the 21st of november at sunrise we were to the west of cape
codera opposite curuao the coast is rocky and very elevated the
scenery at once wild and picturesque we were sufficiently near
land to distinguish scattered huts surrounded by cocoa-trees and
masses of vegetation which stood out from the dark ground of the
rocks the mountains are everywhere perpendicular and three or
four thousand feet high their sides cast broad and deep shadows
upon the humid land which stretches out to the sea glowing with
the freshest verdure this shore produces most of those fruits of
the hot regions which are seen in such great abundance in the
markets of the caracas the fields cultivated with sugar-cane and
maize between camburi and niguatar stretch through narrow
valleys looking like crevices or clefts in the rocks and
penetrated by the rays of the sun then above the horizon they
presented the most singular contrasts of light and shade

the mountain of niguatar and the silla of caracas are the loftiest
summits of this littoral chain the first almost reaches the height
of canigou it seems as if the pyrenees or the alps stripped of
their snows had risen from the bosom of the ocean so much more
stupendous do mountains appear when viewed for the first time from
the sea near caravalleda the cultivated lands enlarge we find
hills with gentle declivities and the vegetation rises to a great
height the sugar-cane is here cultivated and the monks of la
merced have a plantation with two hundred slaves this spot was
formerly extremely subject to fever and it is said that the air
has acquired salubrity since trees have been planted round a small
lake the emanations of which were dreaded and which is now less
exposed to the ardour of the sun to the west of caravalleda a
wall of bare rock again projects forward in the direction of the
sea but it has little extent after having passed it we
immediately discovered the pleasantly situated village of macuto
the black rocks of la guayra studded with batteries rising in
tiers one over another and in the misty distance cabo blanco a
long promontory with conical summits and of dazzling whiteness
cocoa-trees border the shore and give it under that burning sky
an appearance of fertility

i landed in the port of la guayra and the same evening made
preparations for transporting my instruments to caracas having
been recommended not to sleep in the town where the yellow fever
had been raging only a few weeks previously i fixed my lodging in
a house on a little hill above the village of maiquetia a place
more exposed to fresh winds than la guayra i reached caracas on
the 21st of november four days sooner than m bonpland who with
the other travellers on the land journey had suffered greatly from
the rain and the inundations of the torrents between capaya and
curiepe

before proceeding further i will here subjoin a description of la
guayra and the extraordinary road which leads from thence to the
town of caracas adding thereto all the observations made by m
bonpland and myself in an excursion to cabo blanco about the end
of january 1800

la guayra is rather a roadstead than a port the sea is constantly
agitated and ships suffer at once by the violence of the wind the
tideways and the bad anchorage the lading is taken in with
difficulty and the swell prevents the embarkation of mules here
as at new barcelona and porto cabello the free mulattoes and
negroes who carry the cacao on board the ships are a class of men
remarkable for muscular strength they wade up to their waists
through the water and it is remarkable that they are never
attacked by the sharks so common in this harbour this fact seems
connected with what i have often observed within the tropics with
respect to other classes of animals which live in society for
instance monkeys and crocodiles in the missions of the orinoco
and on the banks of the river amazon the indians who catch
monkeys to sell them know very well that they can easily succeed
in taming those which inhabit certain islands while monkeys of the
same species caught on the neighbouring continent die of terror
or rage when they find themselves in the power of man the
crocodiles of one lake in the llanos are cowardly and flee even
when in the water whilst those of another lake will attack with
extreme intrepidity it would be difficult to explain this
difference of disposition and habits by the mere aspect of the
respective localities the sharks of the port of la guayra seem to
furnish an analogous example they are dangerous and blood-thirsty
at the island opposite the coast of caracas at the roques at
bonayre and at curassao while they forbear to attack persons
swimming in the ports of la guayra and santa martha the natives
who like the ignorant mass of people in every country in seeking
the explanation of natural phenomena always have recourse to the
marvellous affirm that in the ports just mentioned a bishop gave
his benediction to the sharks

the situation of la guayra is very singular and can only be
compared to that of santa cruz in teneriffe the chain of mountains
which separates the port from the high valley of caracas descends
almost directly into the sea and the houses of the town are backed
by a wall of steep rocks there scarcely remains one hundred or one
hundred and forty toises breadth of flat ground between the wall
and the ocean the town has six or eight thousand inhabitants and
contains only two streets running parallel with each other east
and west it is commanded by the battery of cerro colorado and its
fortifications along the sea-shore are well disposed and kept in
repair the aspect of this place has in it something solitary and
gloomy we seemed not to be on a continent covered with vast
forests but on a rocky island destitute of vegetation with the
exception of cabo blanco and the cocoa-trees of maiquetia no view
meets the eye but that of the horizon the sea and the azure vault
of heaven the heat is excessive during the day and most
frequently during the night the climate of la guayra is justly
considered to be hotter than that of cumana porto cabello and
coro because the sea-breeze is less felt and the air is heated by
the radiant caloric which the perpendicular rocks emit from the
time the sun sets the examination of the thermometric observations
made during nine months at la guayra by an eminent physician
enabled me to compare the climate of this port with those of
cumana of the havannah and of vera cruz this comparison is the
more interesting as it furnishes an inexhaustible subject of
conversation in the spanish colonies and among the mariners who
frequent those latitudes as nothing is more deceiving in such
matters than the testimony of the senses we can judge of the
difference of climates only by numerical calculations

the four places of which we have been speaking are considered as
the hottest on the shores of the new world a comparison of them
may serve to confirm what we have several times observed that it
is generally the duration of a high temperature and not the excess
of heat or its absolute quantity which occasions the sufferings
of the inhabitants of the torrid zone

a series of thermometric observations shows that la guayra is one
of the hottest places on the earth that the quantity of heat which
it receives in the course of a year is a little greater than that
felt at cumana but that in the months of november december and
january (at equal distance from the two passages of the sun through
the zenith of the town) the atmosphere cools more at la guayra
may not this cooling much slighter than that which is felt almost
at the same time at vera cruz and at the havannah be the effect of
the more westerly position of la guayra? the aerial ocean which
appears to form only one mass is agitated by currents the limits
of which are fixed by immutable laws and its temperature is
variously modified by the configuration of the lands and seas by
which it is sustained it may be subdivided into several basins
which overflow into each other and of which the most agitated (for
instance that over the gulf of mexico or between the sierra of
santa martha and the gulf of darien) have a powerful influence on
the refrigeration and the motion of the neighbouring columns of
air the north winds sometimes cause influxes and counter-currents
in the south-west part of the caribbean sea which seem during
particular months to diminish the heat as far as terra firma

at the time of my abode at la guayra the yellow fever or
calentura amarilla had been known only two years and the
mortality it occasioned had not been very great because the
confluence of strangers on the coast of caracas was less
considerable than at the havannah or vera cruz a few individuals
even creoles and mulattoes were sometimes carried off suddenly by
certain irregular remittent fevers which from being complicated
with bilious appearances hemorrhages and other symptoms equally
alarming appeared to have some analogy with the yellow fever the
victims of these maladies were generally men employed in the hard
labour of cutting wood in the forests for instance in the
neighbourhood of the little port of carupano or the gulf of santa
fe west of cumana their death often alarmed the unacclimated
europeans in towns usually regarded as peculiarly healthy but the
seeds of the sporadic malady were propagated no farther on the
coast of terra firma the real typhus of america which is known by
the names vomito prieto (black vomit) and yellow fever and which
must be considered as a morbid affection sui generis was known
only at porto cabello at carthagena and at santa martha where
gastelbondo observed and described it in 1729 the spaniards
recently disembarked and the inhabitants of the valley of caracas
were not then afraid to reside at la guayra they complained only
of the oppressive heat which prevailed during a great part of the
year if they exposed themselves to the immediate action of the
sun they dreaded at most only those attacks of inflammation of the
skin or eyes which are felt everywhere in the torrid zone and are
often accompanied by a febrile affection and congestion in the
head many individuals preferred the ardent but uniform climate of
la guayra to the cool but extremely variable climate of caracas
and scarcely any mention was made of the insalubrity of the former
port

since the year 1797 everything has changed commerce being thrown
open to other vessels besides those of the mother country seamen
born in colder parts of europe than spain and consequently more
susceptible to the climate of the torrid zone began to frequent la
guayra the yellow fever broke out north americans seized with
the typhus were received in the spanish hospitals and it was
affirmed that they had imported the contagion and that the disease
had appeared on board a brig from philadelphia even before the
vessel had entered the roads of la guayra the captain of the brig
denied the fact and asserted that far from having introduced the
malady his crew had caught it in the port we know from what
happened at cadiz in 1800 how difficult it is to elucidate facts
when their uncertainty serves to favour theories diametrically
opposite one to another the more enlightened inhabitants of
caracas and la guayra divided in opinion like the physicians of
europe and the united states on the question of the contagion of
yellow fever cited the instance of the american vessel some for
the purpose of proving that the typhus had come from abroad and
others to show that it had taken birth in the country itself
those who advocated the latter opinion admitted that an
extraordinary alteration had been caused in the constitution of the
atmosphere by the overflowings of the rio de la guayra this
torrent which in general is not ten inches deep was swelled after
sixty hours' rain in the mountains in so extraordinary a manner
that it bore down trunks of trees and masses of rock of
considerable size during this flood the waters were from thirty to
forty feet in breadth and from eight to ten feet deep it was
supposed that issuing from some subterranean basin formed by
successive infiltrations they had flowed into the recently cleared
arable lands many houses were carried away by the torrent and the
inundation became the more dangerous for the stores in consequence
of the gate of the town which could alone afford an outlet to the
waters being accidentally closed it was necessary to make a
breach in the wall on the sea-side more than thirty persons
perished and the damage was computed at half a million of
piastres the stagnant water which infected the stores the
cellars and the dungeons of the public prison no doubt diffused
miasms in the air which as a predisposing cause may have
accelerated the development of the yellow fever but i believe that
the inundation of the rio de la guayra was no more the primary
cause than the overflowings of the guadalquivir the xenil and
the gual-medina were at seville at ecija and at malaga the
primary causes of the fatal epidemics of 1800 and 1804 i examined
with attention the bed of the torrent of la guayra and found it to
consist merely of a barren soil blocks of mica-slate and gneiss
containing pyrites detached from the sierra de avila but nothing
that could have had any effect in deteriorating the purity of the
air

since the years 1797 and 1798 at which periods there prevailed
dreadful mortality at philadelphia st lucia and st domingo the
yellow fever has continued its ravages at la guayra it has proved
fatal not only to the troops newly arrived from spain but also to
those levied in parts remote from the coasts in the llanos between
calabozo and uritucu regions almost as hot as la guayra but
favourable to health this latter fact would seem more surprising
did we not know that even the natives of vera cruz who are not
attacked with typhus in their own town sometimes sink under it
during the epidemics of the havannah and the united states as the
black vomit finds an insurmountable barrier at the encero (four
hundred and seventy-six toises high) on the declivity of the
mountains of mexico in the direction of xalapa where oaks begin
to appear and the climate begins to be cool and pleasant so the
yellow fever scarcely ever passes beyond the ridge of mountains
which separates la guayra from the valley of caracas this valley
has been exempt from the malady for a considerable time for we
must not confound the vomito and the yellow fever with the
irregular and bilious fevers the cumbre and the cerro do avila
form a very useful rampart to the town of caracas the elevation of
which a little exceeds that of the encero but of which the mean
temperature is above that of xalapa

i have published in another work* (* nouvelle espagne tome 2) the
observations made by m bonpland and myself on the locality of the
towns periodically subject to the visitation of yellow fever and i
shall not hazard here any new conjectures on the changes observed
in the pathogenic constitution of particular localities the more i
reflect on this subject the more mysterious appears to me all that
relates to those gaseous emanations which we call so vaguely the
seeds of contagion and which are supposed to be developed by a
corrupted air destroyed by cold conveyed from place to place in
garments and attached to the walls of houses how can we explain
why for the space of eighteen years prior to 1794 there was not a
single instance of the vomito at vera cruz though the concourse of
unacclimated europeans and of mexicans from the interior was very
considerable though sailors indulged in the same excesses with
which they are still reproached and though the town was not so
clean as it has been since the year 1800?

the following is the series of pathological facts considered in
their simplest point of view when a great number of persons born
in a cold climate arrive at the same period in a port of the
torrid zone not particularly dreaded by navigators the typhus of
america begins to appear those persons have not had typhus during
their passage it appears among them only after they have landed
is the atmospheric constitution changed? or is it that a new form
of disease develops itself among individuals whose susceptibility
is highly increased?

the typhus soon begins to extend its ravages among other europeans
born in more southern countries if propagated by contagion it
seems surprising that in the towns of the equinoctial continent it
does not attach itself to certain streets and that immediate
contact* does not augment the danger any more than seclusion
diminishes it (* in the oriental plague (another form of typhus
characterised by great disorder of the lymphatic system) immediate
contact is less to be feared than is generally thought larrey
maintains that the tumified glands may be touched or cauterized
without danger but he thinks we ought not to risk putting on the
clothes of persons attacked with the plague memoire sur les
maladies de l'armee francoise en egypte page 35) the sick when
removed to the inland country and especially to cooler and more
elevated spots to xalapa for instance do not communicate typhus
to the inhabitants of those places either because the disease is
not contagious in its nature or because the predisposing causes
are not the same as in the regions of the shore when there is a
considerable lowering of the temperature the epidemic usually
ceases even on the spot where it first appeared it again breaks
out at the approach of the hot season and sometimes long before
though during several months there may have been no sick person in
the harbour and no ship may have entered it

the typhus of america appears to be confined to the shore either
because persons who bring the disease disembark there and goods
supposed to be impregnated with deleterious miasms are there
accumulated or because on the sea-side gaseous emanations of a
particular nature are formed the aspect of the places subject to
the ravages of typhus seems often to exclude all idea of a local or
endemical origin it has been known to prevail in the canaries the
bermudas and among the small west india islands in dry places
formerly distinguished for the great salubrity of their climate
examples of the propagation of the yellow fever in the inland parts
of the torrid zone appear very doubtful that malady may have been
confounded with remitting bilious fevers with respect to the
temperate zone in which the contagious character of the american
typhus is more decided the disease has unquestionably spread far
from the shore even into very elevated places exposed to cool and
dry winds as in spain at medina-sidonia at carlotta and in the
city of murcia that variety of phenomena which the same epidemic
exhibits according to the difference of climate the union of
predisposing causes its shorter or longer duration and the degree
of its exacerbation should render us extremely circumspect in
tracing the secret causes of the american typhus m bailly who
at the time of the violent epidemics in 1802 and 1803 was chief
physician to the colony of st domingo and who studied that
disease in the island of cuba the united states and spain is of
opinion that the typhus is very often but not always contagious

since the yellow fever has made such ravages in la guayra
exaggerated accounts have been given of the uncleanliness in that
little town as well as of vera cruz and of the quays or wharfs of
philadelphia in a place where the soil is extremely dry destitute
of vegetation and where scarcely a few drops of water fall in the
course of seven or eight months the causes that produce what are
called miasms cannot be of very frequent occurrence la guayra
appeared to me in general to be tolerably clean with the exception
of the quarter of the slaughter-houses the sea-side has no beach
on which the remains of fuci or molluscs are heaped up but the
neighbouring coast which stretches eastward towards cape codera
and consequently to the windward of la guayra is extremely
unhealthy intermitting putrid and bilious fevers often prevail
at macuto and at caravalleda and when from time to time the breeze
is interrupted by a westerly wind the little bay of cotia sends
air loaded with putrid emanations towards the coast of la guayra
notwithstanding the rampart opposed by cabo blanco

the irritability of the organs being so different in the people of
the north and those of the south it cannot be doubted that with
greater freedom of commerce and more frequent and intimate
communication between countries situated in different climates the
yellow fever will extend its ravages in the new world it is even
probable that the concurrence of so many exciting causes and their
action on individuals so differently organized may give birth to
new forms of disease and new deviations of the vital powers this
is one of the evils that inevitably attend rising civilization

the yellow fever and the black vomit cease periodically at the
havannah and vera cruz when the north winds bring the cold air of
canada towards the gulf of mexico but from the extreme equality of
temperature which characterizes the climates of porto cabello la
guayra new barcelona and cumana it may be feared that the typhus
will there become permanent whenever from a great influx of
strangers it has acquired a high degree of exacerbation

tracing the granitic coast of la guayra westward we find between
that port (which is in fact but an ill-sheltered roadstead) and
that of porto cabello several indentations of the land furnishing
excellent anchorage for ships such are the small bay of catia los
arecifes puerto-la-cruz choroni sienega de ocumare turiamo
burburata and patanebo all these ports with the exception of
that of burburata from which mules are exported to jamaica are
now frequented only by small coasting vessels which are there
laden with provisions and cacao from the surrounding plantations
the inhabitants of caracas are desirous to avail themselves of the
anchorage of catia to the west of cabo blanco m bonpland and
myself examined that point of the coast during our second abode at
la guayra a ravine called the quebrada de tipe descends from the
table-land of caracas towards catia a plan has long been in
contemplation for making a cart-road through this ravine and
abandoning the old road to la guayra which resembles the passage
over st gothard according to this plan the port of catia
equally large and secure would supersede that of la guayra
unfortunately however all that shore to leeward of cabo blanco
abounds with mangroves and is extremely unhealthy i ascended to
the summit of the promontory which forms cabo blanco in order to
observe the passage of the sun over the meridian i wished to
compare in the morning the altitudes taken with an artificial
horizon and those taken with the horizon of the sea to verify the
apparent depression of the latter by the barometrical measurement
of the hill by this method hitherto very little employed on
reducing the heights of the sun to the same time a reflecting
instrument may be used like an instrument furnished with a level i
found the latitude of the cape to be 10 degrees 36 minutes 45
seconds i could only make use of the angles which gave the image
of the sun reflected on a plane glass the horizon of the sea was
very misty and the windings of the coast prevented me from taking
the height of the sun on that horizon

the environs of cabo blanco are not uninteresting for the study of
rocks the gneiss here passes into the state of mica-slate
(glimmerschiefer) and contains along the sea-coast layers of
schistose chlorite (chloritschiefer) in this latter i found
garnets and magnetical sand on the road to catia we see the
chloritic schist passing into hornblende schist
(hornblendschiefer) all these formations are found together in the
primitive mountains of the old world especially in the north of
europe the sea at the foot of cabo blanco throws up on the beach
rolled fragments of a rock which is a granular mixture of
hornblende and lamellar feldspar it is what is rather vaguely
called primitive grunstein in it we can recognize traces of quartz
and pyrites submarine rocks probably exist near the coast which
furnish these very hard masses i have compared them in my journal
to the paterlestein of fichtelberg in franconia which is also a
diabase but so fusible that glass buttons are made of it which
are employed in the slave-trade on the coast of guinea i believed
at first according to the analogy of the phenomena furnished by
the mountains of franconia that the presence of these hornblende
masses with crystals of common (uncompact) feldspar indicated the
proximity of transition rocks but in the high valley of caracas
near antimano balls of the same diabase fill a vein crossing the
mica-slate on the western declivity of the hill of cabo blanco
the gneiss is covered with a formation of sandstone or
conglomerate extremely recent this sandstone combines angular
fragments of gneiss quartz and chlorite magnetical sand
madrepores and petrified bivalve shells is this formation of the
same date as that of punta araya and cumana?

scarcely any part of the coast has so burning a climate as the
environs of cabo blanco we suffered much from the heat augmented
by the reverberation of a barren and dusty soil but without
feeling any bad consequences from the effects of insolation the
powerful action of the sun on the cerebral functions is extremely
dreaded at la guayra especially at the period when the yellow
fever begins to be felt being one day on the terrace of the house
observing at noon the difference of the thermometer in the sun and
in the shade a man approached me holding in his hand a potion
which he conjured me to swallow he was a physician who from his
window had observed me bareheaded and exposed to the rays of the
sun he assured me that being a native of a very northern
climate i should infallibly after the imprudence i had committed
be attacked with the yellow fever that very evening if i refused
to take the remedy against it i was not alarmed by this
prediction however serious believing myself to have been long
acclimated but i could not resist yielding to entreaties prompted
by such benevolent feelings i swallowed the dose and the
physician doubtless counted me among the number of those he had
saved

the road leading from the port to caracas (the capital of a
government of near 900000 inhabitants) resembles as i have
already observed the passage over the alps the road of st
gothard and of the great st bernard taking the level of the road
had never been attempted before my arrival in the province of
venezuela no precise idea had even been formed of the elevation of
the valley of caracas it had indeed been long observed that the
descent was much less from la cumbre and las vueltas (the latter is
the culminating point of the road towards the pastora at the
entrance of the valley of caracas) than towards the port of la
guayra but the mountain of avila having a very considerable bulk
the eye cannot discern simultaneously the points to be compared it
is even impossible to form a precise idea of the elevation of
caracas from the climate of the valley where the atmosphere is
cooled by the descending currents of air and by the mists which
envelope the lofty summit of the silla during a great part of the
year

when in the season of the great heats we breathe the burning
atmosphere of la guayra and turn our eyes towards the mountains
it seems scarcely possible that at the distance of five or six
thousand toises a population of forty thousand individuals
assembled in a narrow valley enjoys the coolness of spring a
temperature which at night descends to 12 degrees of the centesimal
thermometer this near approach of different climates is common in
the cordillera of the andes but everywhere at mexico at quito
in peru and in new granada it is only after a long journey into
the interior either across plains or along rivers that we reach
the great cities which are the central points of civilization the
height of caracas is but a third of that of mexico quito and
santa fe de bogota yet of all the capitals of spanish america
which enjoy a cool and delicious climate in the midst of the torrid
zone caracas is nearest to the coast what a privilege for a city
to possess a seaport at three leagues distance and to be situated
among mountains on a table-land which would produce wheat if the
cultivation of the coffee-tree were not preferred

the road from la guayra to the valley of caracas is infinitely
finer than the road from honda to santa fe or that from guayaquil
to quito it is kept in better order than the old road which led
from the port of vera cruz to perote on the eastern declivity of
the mountains of new spain with good mules it takes but three
hours to go from the port of la guayra to caracas and only two
hours to return with loaded mules or on foot the journey is from
four to five hours the road runs along a ridge of rocks extremely
steep and after passing the stations bearing respectively the
names of torre quemada curucuti and salto we arrive at a large
inn (la venta) built at six hundred toises above the level of the
sea the name torre quemada or burnt tower indicates the
sensation that is felt in descending towards la guayra a
suffocating heat is reflected from the walls of rock and
especially from the barren plains on which the traveller looks
down on this road as on that from vera cruz to mexico and
wherever on a rapid declivity the climate changes the increase of
muscular strength and the sensation of well-being which we
experience as we advance into strata of cooler air have always
appeared to me less striking than the feeling of languor and
debility which pervades the frame when we descend towards the
burning plains of the coast but such is the organization of man
and even in the moral world we are less soothed by that which
ameliorates our condition than annoyed by a new sensation of
discomfort

from curucuti to salto the ascent is somewhat less laborious the
sinuosities of the way render the declivity easier as in the old
road over mont cenis the salto (or leap) is a crevice which is
crossed by a draw-bridge fortifications crown the summit of the
mountain at la venta the thermometer at noon stood at 193
degrees when at la guayra it kept up at the same hour at 262
degrees la venta enjoys some celebrity in europe and in the united
states for the beauty of its surrounding scenery when the clouds
permit this spot affords a magnificent view of the sea and the
neighbouring coasts an horizon of more than twenty-two leagues
radius is visible the white and barren shore reflects a dazzling
mass of light and the spectator beholds at his feet cabo blanco
the village of maiquetia with its cocoa-trees la guayra and the
vessels in the port but i found this view far more extraordinary
when the sky was not serene and when trains of clouds strongly
illumined on their upper surface seemed projected like floating
islands on the ocean strata of vapour hovering at different
heights formed intermediary spaces between the eye and the lower
regions by an illusion easily explained they enlarged the scene
and rendered it more majestic trees and dwellings appeared at
intervals through the openings which were left by the clouds when
driven on by the winds and rolling over one another objects then
appear at a greater depth than when seen through a pure and
uniformly serene air on the declivity of the mountains of mexico
at the same height (between las trancas and xalapa) the sea is
twelve leagues distant and the view of the coast is confused
while on the road from la guayra to caracas we command the plains
(the tierra caliente) as from the top of a tower how
extraordinary must be the impression created by this prospect on
natives of the inland parts of the country who behold the sea and
ships for the first time from this point

i determined by direct observations the latitude of la venta that
i might be enabled to give a more precise idea of the distance of
the coasts the latitude is 10 degrees 33 minutes 9 seconds its
longitude appeared to me by the chronometer nearly 2 minutes 47
seconds west of the town of caracas i found the dip of the needle
at this height to be 4175 degrees and the intensity of the
magnetic forces equal to two hundred and thirty-four oscillations
from the venta called also la venta grande to distinguish it from
three or four small inns formerly established along the road but
now destroyed there is still an ascent of one hundred and fifty
toises to guayavo this is nearly the most lofty point of the road

whether we gaze on the distant horizon of the sea or turn our eyes
south-eastward in the direction of the serrated ridge of rocks
which seems to unite the cumbre and the silla though separated
from them by the ravine (quebrada) of tocume everywhere we admire
the grand character of the landscape from guayavo we proceed for
half an hour over a smooth table-land covered with alpine plants
this part of the way on account of its windings is called las
vueltas we find a little higher up the barracks or magazines of
flour which were constructed in a spot of cool temperature by the
guipuzcoa company when they had the exclusive monopoly of the
trade of caracas and supplied that place with provision on the
road to las vueltas we see for the first time the capital situated
three hundred toises below in a valley luxuriantly planted with
coffee and european fruit-trees travellers are accustomed to halt
near a fine spring known by the name of fuente de sanchorquiz
which flows down from the sierra on sloping strata of gneiss i
found its temperature 164 degrees which for an elevation of
seven hundred and twenty-six toises is considerably cool and it
would appear much cooler to those who drink its limpid water if
instead of gushing out between la cumbre and the temperate valley
of caracas it were found on the descent towards la guayra but at
this descent on the northern side of the mountain the rock by an
uncommon exception in this country does not dip to north-west but
to south-east which prevents the subterranean waters from forming
springs there

we continued to descend from the small ravine of sanchorquiz to la
cruz de la guayra a cross erected on an open spot six hundred and
thirty-two toises high and thence (entering by the custom-house
and the quarter of the pastora) to the city of caracas on the
south side of the mountain of avila the gneiss presents several
geognostical phenomena worthy of the attention of travellers it is
traversed by veins of quartz containing cannulated and often
articulated prisms of rutile titanite two or three lines in
diameter in the fissures of the quartz we find on breaking it
very thin crystals which crossing each other form a kind of
network sometimes the red schorl occurs only in dendritic crystals
of a bright red* (* especially below the cross of la guayra at
594 toises of absolute elevation) the gneiss of the valley of
caracas is characterized by the red and green garnets it contains
they however disappear when the rock passes into mica-slate this
same phenomenon has been remarked by von buch in sweden but in the
temperate parts of europe garnets are in general contained in
serpentine and mica-slates not in gneiss in the walls which
enclose the gardens of caracas constructed partly of fragments of
gneiss we find garnets of a very fine red a little transparent
and very difficult to detach the gneiss near the cross of la
guayra half a league from caracas presented also vestiges of
azure copper-ore* (* blue carbonate of copper) disseminated in
veins of quartz and small strata of plumbago (black lead) or
earthy carburetted iron this last is found in pretty large masses
and sometimes mingled with sparry iron-ore in the ravine of
tocume to the west of the silla

between the spring of sanchorquiz and the cross of la guayra as
well as still higher up the gneiss contains considerable beds of
saccharoidal bluish-grey primitive limestone coarse-grained
containing mica and traversed by veins of white calcareous spar
the mica with large folia lies in the direction of the dip of the
strata i found in the primitive limestone a great many
crystallized pyrites and rhomboidal fragments of sparry iron-ore
of isabella yellow i endeavoured but without success to find
tremolite (grammatite of hauy the primitive limestone above the
spring of sanchorquiz is directed as the gneiss in that place
hor 52 and dips 45 degrees north but the general direction of
the gneiss is in the cerro de avila hor 34 with 60 degrees of
dip north-west exceptions merely local are observed in a small
space of ground near the cross of la guayra (hor 62 dip 8
degrees north) and higher up opposite the quebrada of tipe (hor
12 dip 50 degrees west)) which in the fichtelberg in franconia
is common in the primitive limestone without dolomite in europe
beds of primitive limestone are generally observed in the
mica-slates but we find also saccharoidal limestone in gneiss of
the most ancient formation in sweden near upsala in saxony near
burkersdorf and in the alps in the road over the simplon these
situations are analogous to that of caracas the phenomena of
geognosy particularly those which are connected with the
stratification of rocks and their grouping are never solitary
but are found the same in both hemispheres i was the more struck
with these relations and this identity of formations as at the
time of my journey in these countries mineralogists were
unacquainted with the name of a single rock of venezuela new
grenada and the cordilleras of quito

general view of the provinces of venezuela
diversity of their interests
city and valley of caracas
climate

in all those parts of spanish america in which civilization did not
exist to a certain degree before the conquest (as it did in mexico
guatimala quito and peru) it has advanced from the coasts to the
interior of the country following sometimes the valley of a great
river sometimes a chain of mountains affording a temperate
climate concentrated at once in different points it has spread as
if by diverging rays the union into provinces and kingdoms was
effected on the first immediate contact between civilized parts or
at least those subject to permanent and regular government lands
deserted or inhabited by savage tribes now surround the countries
which european civilization has subdued they divide its conquests
like arms of the sea difficult to be passed and neighbouring
states are often connected with each other only by slips of
cultivated land it is less difficult to acquire a knowledge of the
configuration of coasts washed by the ocean than of the
sinuosities of that interior shore on which barbarism and
civilization impenetrable forests and cultivated land touch and
bound each other from not having reflected on the early state of
society in the new world geographers have often made their maps
incorrect by marking the different parts of the spanish and
portuguese colonies as though they were contiguous at every point
in the interior the local knowledge which i obtained respecting
these boundaries enables me to fix the extent of the great
territorial divisions with some certainty to compare the wild and
inhabited parts and to appreciate the degree of political
influence exercised by certain towns of america as centres of
power and of commerce

caracas is the capital of a country nearly twice as large as peru
and now little inferior in extent to the kingdom of new grenada*
(* the capitania-general of caracas contains near 48000 square
leagues (twenty-five to a degree) peru since la paz potosi
charcas and santa cruz de la sierra have been separated from it
contains only 30000 new grenada including the province of quito
contains 65000 reinos capitanias-generales presidencies
goviernos and provincias are the names by which spain formerly
distinguished her transmarine possessions or as they were called
dominios de ultramar (dominions beyond sea)) this country which
the spanish government designates by the name of capitania-general
de caracas* (* the captain-general of caracas has the title of
"capitan-general de las provincias de venezuela y ciudad do
caracas") or of the united provinces of venezuela has nearly a
million of inhabitants among whom are sixty thousand slaves it
comprises along the coasts new andalusia or the province of
cumana (with the island of margareta)* (* this island near the
coast of cumana forms a separate govierno depending immediately
on the captain-general of caracas) barcelona venezuela or
caracas coro and maracaybo in the interior the provinces of
varinas and guiana the former situated on the rivers of santo
domingo and the apure the latter stretching along the orinoco the
casiquiare the atabapo and the rio negro in a general view of
the seven united provinces of terra firma we perceive that they
form three distinct zones extending from east to west

we find first cultivated land along the sea-shore and near the
chain of the mountains on the coast next savannahs or pasturages
and finally beyond the orinoco a third zone that of the forests
into which we can penetrate only by the rivers which traverse them
if the native inhabitants of the forests lived entirely on the
produce of the chase like those of the missouri we might say that
the three zones into which we have divided the territory of
venezuela picture the three states of human society the life of
the wild hunter in the woods of the orinoco pastoral life in the
savannahs or llanos and the agricultural state in the high
valleys and at the foot of the mountains on the coast missionary
monks and some few soldiers occupy here as throughout all spanish
america advanced posts along the frontiers of brazil in this
first zone are felt the preponderance of force and the abuse of
power which is its necessary consequence the natives carry on
civil war and sometimes devour one another the monks endeavour to
augment the number of little villages of their missions by taking
advantage of the dissensions of the natives the military live in a
state of hostility to the monks whom they were intended to
protect everything presents a melancholy picture of misery and
privation we shall soon have occasion to examine more closely that
state of man which is vaunted as a state of nature by those who
inhabit towns in the second region in the plains and
pasture-grounds food is extremely abundant but has little
variety although more advanced in civilization the people beyond
the circle of some scattered towns are not less isolated from one
another at sight of their dwellings partly covered with skins and
leather it might be supposed that far from being fixed they are
scarcely encamped in those vast plains which extend to the horizon
agriculture which alone consolidates the bases and strengthens
the bonds of society occupies the third zone the shore and
especially the hot and temperate valleys among the mountains near
the sea

it may be objected that in other parts of spanish and portuguese
america wherever we can trace the progressive development of
civilization we find the three ages of society combined but it
must be remembered that the position of the three zones that of
the forests the pastures and the cultivated land is not
everywhere the same and that it is nowhere so regular as in
venezuela it is not always from the coast to the interior that
population commercial industry and intellectual improvement
diminish in mexico peru and quito the table-lands and central
mountains possess the greatest number of cultivators the most
numerous towns situated near to each other and the most ancient
institutions we even find that in the kingdom of buenos ayres
the region of pasturage known by the name of the pampas lies
between the isolated part of buenos ayres and the great mass of
indian cultivators who inhabit the cordilleras of charcas la paz
and potosi this circumstance gives birth to a diversity of
interests in the same country between the people of the interior
and those who inhabit the coasts

to form an accurate idea of those vast provinces which have been
governed for ages almost like separate states by viceroys and
captains-general we must fix our attention at once on several
points we must distinguish the parts of spanish america opposite
to asia from those on the shores of the atlantic we must ascertain
where the greater portion of the population is placed whether near
the coast or concentrated in the interior on the cold and
temperate table-lands of the cordilleras we must verify the
numerical proportions between the natives and other castes search
into the origin of the european families and examine to what race
in each part of the colonies belongs the greater number of whites
the andalusian-canarians of venezuela the mountaineers* (*
montaneses the inhabitants of the mountains of santander are
called by this name in spain) and the biscayans of mexico the
catalonians of buenos ayres differ essentially in their aptitude
for agriculture for the mechanical arts for commerce and for all
objects connected with intellectual development each of those
races has preserved in the new as in the old world the shades
that constitute its national physiognomy its asperity or mildness
of character its freedom from sordid feelings or its excessive
love of gain its social hospitality or its taste for solitude in
the countries where the population is for the most part composed of
indians and mixed races the difference between the europeans and
their descendants cannot indeed be so strongly marked as that
which existed anciently in the colonies of ionian and doric origin
the spaniards transplanted to the torrid zone estranged from the
habits of their mother-country must have felt more sensible
changes than the greeks settled on the coasts of asia minor and of
italy where the climates differ so little from those of athens and
corinth it cannot be denied that the character of the spanish
americans has been variously modified by the physical nature of the
country the isolated sites of the capitals on the table-lands or
in the vicinity of the coasts the agricultural life the labour of
the mines and the habit of commercial speculation but in the
inhabitants of caracas santa fe quito and buenos ayres we
recognize everywhere something which belongs to the race and the
filiation of the people

if we examine the state of the capitania-general of caracas
according to the principles here laid down we perceive that
agricultural industry the great mass of population the numerous
towns and everything connected with advanced civilization are
found near the coast this coast extends along a space of two
hundred leagues it is washed by the caribbean sea a sort of
mediterranean on the shores of which almost all the nations of
europe have founded colonies which communicates at several points
with the atlantic and which has had a considerable influence on
the progress of knowledge in the eastern part of equinoctial
america from the time of the conquest the kingdoms of new grenada
and mexico have no connection with foreign colonies and through
them with the nations of europe except by the ports of carthagena
of santa martha of vera cruz and of campeachy these vast
countries from the nature of their coasts and the isolation of
their inhabitants on the back of the cordilleras have few points
of contact with foreign lands the gulf of mexico also is but
little frequented during a part of the year on account of the
danger of gales of wind from the north the coasts of venezuela on
the contrary from their extent their eastward direction the
number of their ports and the safety of their anchorage at
different seasons possess all the advantages of the caribbean sea
the communications with the larger islands and even with those
situated to windward can nowhere be more frequent than from the
ports of cumana barcelona la guayra porto cabello coro and
maracaybo can we wonder that this facility of commercial
intercourse with the inhabitants of free america and the agitated
nations of europe should in the provinces united under the
capitania-general of venezuela have augmented opulence knowledge
and that restless desire of a local government which is blended
with the love of liberty and republican forms?

the copper-coloured natives or indians constitute an important
mass of the agricultural population only in those places where the
spaniards at the time of the conquest found regular governments
social communities and ancient and very complicated institutions
as for example in new spain south of durango and in peru from
cuzco to potosi in the capitania-general of caracas the indian
population is inconsiderable at least beyond the missions and in
the cultivated zone even in times of great political excitement
the natives do not inspire any apprehension in the whites or the
mixed castes computing in 1800 the total population of the seven
united provinces at nine hundred thousand souls it appeared to me
that the indians made only one-ninth while at mexico they form
nearly one half of the inhabitants

considering the caribbean sea of which the gulf of mexico makes a
part as an interior sea with several mouths it is important to
fix our attention on the political relations arising out of this
singular configuration of the new continent between countries
placed around the same basin notwithstanding the isolated state in
which most of the mother-countries endeavour to hold their
colonies the agitations that take place are not the less
communicated from one to the other the elements of discord are
everywhere the same and as if by instinct an understanding is
established between men of the same colour although separated by
difference of language and inhabiting opposite coasts that
american mediterranean formed by the shores of venezuela new
grenada mexico the united states and the west india islands
counts upon its borders near a million and a half of free and
enslaved blacks but so unequally distributed that there are very
few to the south and scarcely any in the regions of the west
their great accumulation is on the northern and eastern coasts
which may be said to be the african part of the interior basin the
commotions which since 1792 have broken out in st domingo have
naturally been propagated to the coasts of venezuela so long as
spain possessed those fine colonies in tranquillity the little
insurrections of the slaves were easily repressed but when a
struggle of another kind that for independence began the blacks
by their menacing position excited alternately the apprehensions of
the opposite parties and the gradual or instantaneous abolition of
slavery has been proclaimed in different regions of spanish
america less from motives of justice and humanity than to secure
the aid of an intrepid race of men habituated to privation and
fighting for their own cause i found in the narrative of the
voyage of girolamo benzoni a curious passage which proves that
the apprehensions caused by the increase of the black population
are of very old date these apprehensions will cease only where
governments shall second by laws the progressive reforms which
refinement of manners opinion and religious sentiment introduce
into domestic slavery "the negroes" says benzoni "multiply so
much at st domingo that in 1545 when i was in terra firma [on
the coast of caracas] i saw many spaniards who had no doubt that
the island would shortly be the property of the blacks"* (* "vi
sono molti spagnuoli che tengono per cosa certa che quest' isola
(san dominico) in breve tempo sara posseduta da questi mori di
guinea" (benzoni istoria del mondo nuovo ediz 2da 1672 page 65)
the author who is not very scrupulous in the adoption of
statistical facts believes that in his time there were at st
domingo seven thousand fugitive negroes (mori cimaroni) with whom
don luis columbus made a treaty of peace and friendship) it was
reserved for our age to see this prediction accomplished and a
european colony of america transform itself into an african state

the sixty thousand slaves which the seven united provinces of
venezuela are computed to contain are so unequally divided that
in the province of caracas alone there are nearly forty thousand
one-fifth of whom are mulattoes in maracaybo there are ten or
twelve thousand but in cumana and barcelona scarcely six
thousand to judge of the influence which the slaves and men of
colour exercise on the public tranquility it is not enough to know
their number we must consider their accumulation at certain
points and their manner of life as cultivators or inhabitants of
towns in the province of venezuela the slaves are assembled
together on a space of no great extent between the coast and a
line which passes (at twelve leagues from the coast) through
panaquire yare sabana de ocumare villa de cura and nirgua the
llanos or vast plains of calaboso san carlos guanare and
barquecimeto contain only four or five thousand slaves who are
scattered among the farms and employed in the care of cattle the
number of free men is very considerable the spanish laws and
customs being favourable to affranchisement a master cannot refuse
liberty to a slave who offers him the sum of three hundred
piastres even though the slave may have cost double that price on
account of his industry or a particular aptitude for the trade he
practises instances of persons who voluntarily bestow liberty on a
certain number of their slaves are more common in the province of
venezuela than in any other place a short time before we visited
the fertile valleys of aragua and the lake of valencia a lady who
inhabited the great village of victoria ordered her children on
her death-bed to give liberty to all her slaves thirty in number
i feel pleasure in recording facts that do honour to the character
of a people from whom m bonpland and myself received so many marks
of kindness

if we compare the seven united provinces of venezuela with the
kingdom of mexico and the island of cuba we shall succeed in
finding the approximate number of white creoles and even of
europeans the white creoles whom i may call hispano-americans*
(* in imitation of the word anglo-american adapted in all the
languages of europe in the spanish colonies the whites born in
america are called spaniards and the real spaniards those born in
the mother country are called europeans gachupins or chapetons)
form in mexico nearly a fifth and in the island of cuba according
to the very accurate enumeration of 1801 a third of the whole
population when we reflect that the kingdom of mexico contains two
millions and a half of natives of the copper-coloured race when we
consider the state of the coasts bordering on the pacific and the
small number of whites in the intendencias of puebla and oaxaca
compared with the natives we cannot doubt that the province of
venezuela at least if not the capitania-general has a greater
proportion than that of one to five the island of cuba* (* i do
not mention the kingdom of buenos ayres where among a million of
inhabitants the whites are extremely numerous in parts near the
coast while the table-lands or provinces of the sierra are almost
entirely peopled with natives) in which the whites are even more
numerous than in chile may furnish us with a limiting number that
is to say the maximum which may be supposed in the
capitania-general of caracas i believe we must stop at two
hundred or two hundred and ten thousand hispano-americans in a
total population of nine hundred thousand souls the number of
europeans included in the white race (not comprehending the troops
sent from the mother-country) does not exceed twelve or fifteen
thousand it certainly is not greater at mexico than sixty
thousand and i find by several statements that if we estimate
the whole of the spanish colonies at fourteen or fifteen millions
of inhabitants there are in that number at most three millions of
creole whites and two hundred thousand europeans

when tupac-amaru who believed himself to be the legitimate heir to
the empire of the incas made the conquest of several provinces of
upper peru in 1781 at the head of forty thousand indian
mountaineers all the whites were filled with alarm the
hispano-americans felt like the spaniards born in europe that the
contest was between the copper-coloured race and the whites
between barbarism and civilization tupac-amaru who himself was
not destitute of intellectual cultivation began with flattering
the creoles and the european clergy but soon impelled by events
and by the spirit of vengeance that inspired his nephew andres
condorcanqui he changed his plan a rising for independence became
a cruel war between the different castes the whites were
victorious and excited by a feeling of common interest from that
period they kept watchful attention on the proportions existing in
the different provinces between their numbers and those of the
indians it was reserved for our times to see the whites direct
this attention towards themselves and examine from motives of
distrust the elements of which their own caste is composed every
enterprise in favour of independence and liberty puts the national
or american party in opposition to the men of the mother-country
when i arrived at caracas the latter had just escaped from the
danger with which they thought they were menaced by the
insurrection projected by espana the consequences of that bold
attempt were the more deplorable because instead of investigating
the real causes of the popular discontent it was thought that the
mother-country would be saved by employing vigorous measures at
present the commotions which have arisen throughout the country
from the banks of the rio de la plata to new mexico an extent of
fourteen hundred leagues have divided men of a common origin

the indian population in the united provinces of venezuela is not
considerable and is but recently civilized all the towns were
founded by the spanish conquerors who could not carry out as in
mexico and peru the old civilization of the natives caracas
maracaybo cumana and coro have nothing indian but their names
compared with the three capitals of equinoctial america* (*
mexico santa fe de bogota and quito the elevation of the site of
the capital of guatimala is still unknown judging from the
vegetation we may infer that it is less than 500 toises) situated
on the mountains and enjoying a temperate climate caracas is the
least elevated it is not a central point of commerce like mexico
santa fe de bogota and quito each of the seven provinces united
in one capitania-general has a port by which its produce is
exported it is sufficient to consider the position of the
provinces their respective degree of intercourse with the windward
islands the direction of the mountains and the course of the
great rivers to perceive that caracas can never exercise any
powerful political influence over the territories of which it is
the capital the apure the meta and the orinoco running from
west to east receive all the streams of the llanos or the region
of pasturage st thomas de la guiana will necessarily at some
future day be a trading-place of high importance especially when
the flour of new grenada embarked above the confluence of the rio
negro and the umadea and descending by the meta and orinoco shall
be preferred at caracas and guiana to the flour of new england it
is a great advantage to the provinces of venezuela that their
territorial wealth is not directed to one point like that of
mexico and new grenada which flows to vera cruz and carthagena
but that they possess a great number of towns equally well peopled
and forming various centres of commerce and civilization

the city of caracas is seated at the entrance of the plain of
chacao which extends three leagues eastward in the direction of
caurimare and the cuesta de auyamas and is two leagues and a half
in breadth this plain through which runs the rio guayra is at
the elevation of four hundred and fourteen toises above the level
of the sea the ground on which the city of caracas is built is
uneven and has a steep slope from north-north-west to
south-south-east to form an accurate idea of the situation of
caracas we must bear in mind the general direction of the
mountains of the coast and the great longitudinal valleys by which
they are traversed the rio guayra rises in the group of primitive
mountains of higuerote which separates the valley of caracas from
that of aragua it is formed near las ajuntas by the junction of
the little rivers of san pedro and macarao and runs first eastward
as far as the cuesta of auyamas and then southward uniting its
waters with those of the rio tuy below yare the rio tuy is the
only considerable river in the northern and mountainous part of the
province

the river flows in a direct course from west to east the distance
of thirty leagues and it is navigable along more than three
quarters of that distance by barometrical measurements i found the
slope of the tuy along this length from the plantation of
manterola* (* at the foot of the high mountain of cocuyza 3 east
from victoria) to its mouth east of cape codera to be two
hundred and ninety-five toises this river forms in the chain of
the coast a kind of longitudinal valley while the waters of the
llanos or of five-sixths of the province of caracas follow the
slope of the land southward and join the orinoco this
hydrographic sketch may throw some light on the natural tendency of
the inhabitants of each particular province to export their
productions by different roads

the valleys of caracas and of the tuy run parallel for a
considerable length they are separated by a mountainous tract
which is crossed in going from caracas to the high savannahs of
ocumare passing by la valle and salamanca these savannahs
themselves are beyond the tuy and the valley of the tuy being a
great deal lower than that of caracas the descent is almost
constantly from north to south as cape codera the silla the
cerro de avila between caracas and la guayra and the mountains of
mariara constitute the most northern and elevated range of the
coast chain so the mountains of panaquire ocumare guiripa and
of the villa de cura form the most southern range the general
direction of the strata composing this vast chain of the coast is
from south-east to north-west and the dip is generally towards
north-west hence it follows that the direction of the primitive
strata is independent of that of the whole chain it is extremely
remarkable tracing this chain* from porto cabello as far as
maniquarez and macanao in the island of margareta (* i have
spoken in the preceding chapter of the interruption in the chain
of the coast to the east of cape codera) to find from west to
east first granite then gneiss mica-slate and primitive schist
and finally compact limestone gypsum and conglomerates
containing sea-shells

it is to be regretted that the town of caracas was not built
farther to the east below the entrance of the anauco into the
guayra on that spot near chacao where the valley widens into an
extensive plain which seems to have been levelled by the waters
diego de losada when he founded* the town followed no doubt the
traces of the first establishment made by faxardo at that time
the spaniards attracted by the high repute of the two gold mines
of los teques and baruta were not yet masters of the whole valley
and preferred remaining near the road leading to the coast (* the
foundation of santiago de leon de caracas dates from 1567 and is
posterior to that of cumana coro nueva barcelona and
caravalleda or el collado) the town of quito is also built in the
narrowest and most uneven part of a valley between two fine
plains turupamba and rumipamba

the descent is uninterrupted from the custom-house of the pastora
by the square of trinidad and the plaza mayor to santa rosalia
and the rio guayra this declivity of the ground does not prevent
carriages from going about the town but the inhabitants make
little use of them three small rivers descending from the
mountains the anauco the catuche and the caraguata intersect
the town running from north to south their banks are very high
and with the dried-up ravines which join them furrowing the
ground they remind the traveller of the famous guaicos of quito
only on a smaller scale the water used for drinking at caracas is
that of the rio catuche but the richer class of the inhabitants
have their water brought from la valle a village a league distant
on the south this water and that of gamboa are considered very
salubrious because they flow over the roots of sarsaparilla* (*
throughout america water is supposed to share the properties of
those plants under the shade of which it flows thus at the
straits of magellan that water is much praised which comes in
contact with the roots of the canella winterana) i could not
discover in them any aromatic or extractive matter the water of
the valley does not contain lime but a little more carbonic acid
than the water of the anauco the new bridge over this river is a
handsome structure caracas contains eight churches five convents
and a theatre capable of holding fifteen or eighteen hundred
persons when i was there the pit in which the seats of the men
are apart from those of the women was uncovered by this means the
spectators could either look at the actors or gaze at the stars as
the misty weather made me lose a great many observations of
jupiter's satellites i was able to ascertain as i sat in a box in
the theatre whether the planet would be visible that night the
streets of caracas are wide and straight and they cross each other
at right angles as in all the towns built by the spaniards in
america the houses are spacious and higher than they ought to be
in a country subject to earthquakes in 1800 the two squares of
alta gracia and san francisco presented a very agreeable aspect i
say in the year 1800 because the terrible shocks of the 26th of
march 1812 almost destroyed the whole city which is only now
slowly rising from its ruins the quarter of trinidad in which i
resided was destroyed as completely as if a mine had been sprung
beneath it

the small extent of the valley and the proximity of the high
mountains of avila and the silla give a gloomy and stern character
to the scenery of caracas particularly in that part of the year
when the coolest temperature prevails namely in the months of
november and december the mornings are then very fine and on a
clear and serene sky we could perceive the two domes or rounded
pyramids of the silla and the craggy ridge of the cerro de avila
but towards evening the atmosphere thickens the mountains are
overhung with clouds streams of vapour cling to their evergreen
slopes and seem to divide them into zones one above another these
zones are gradually blended together the cold air which descends
from the silla accumulates in the valley and condenses the light
vapours into large fleecy clouds these often descend below the
cross of la guayra and advance gliding on the soil in the
direction of the pastora of caracas and the adjacent quarter of
trinidad beneath this misty sky i could scarcely imagine myself
to be in one of the temperate valleys of the torrid zone but
rather in the north of germany among the pines and the larches
that cover the mountains of the hartz

but this gloomy aspect this contrast between the clearness of
morning and the cloudy sky of evening is not observable in the
midst of summer the nights of june and july are clear and
delicious the atmosphere then preserves almost without
interruption the purity and transparency peculiar to the
table-lands and elevated valleys of these regions in calm weather
as long as the winds do not mingle together strata of air of
unequal temperature that is the season for enjoying the beauty of
the landscape which however i saw clearly illumined only during
a few days at the end of january the two rounded summits of the
silla are seen at caracas almost under the same angles of
elevation* as the peak of teneriffe at the port of orotava* (* i
found at the square of trinidad the apparent height of the silla
to be 11 degrees 12 minutes 49 seconds it was about four thousand
five hundred toises distant) the first half of the mountain is
covered with short grass then succeeds the zone of evergreen trees
reflecting a purple light at the season when the befaria the
alpine rose-tree* (* rhododendron ferrugineum of the alps) of
equinoctial america is in blossom the rocky masses rise above
this wooded zone in the form of domes being destitute of
vegetation they increase by the nakedness of their surface the
apparent height of a mountain which in the temperate parts of
europe would scarcely rise to the limit of perpetual snow the
cultivated region of the valley and the gay plains of chacao
petare and la vega form an agreeable contrast to the imposing
aspect of the silla and the great irregularities of the ground on
the north of the town

the climate of caracas has often been called a perpetual spring
the same sort of climate exists everywhere halfway up the
cordilleras of equinoctial america between four hundred and nine
hundred toises of elevation except in places where the great
breadth of the valleys combined with an arid soil causes an
extraordinary intensity* of radiant caloric (* as at carthago and
ibague in new grenada) what can we conceive to be more delightful
than a temperature which in the day keeps between 20 and 26 degrees
(between 16 and 208 degrees reaum) and at night between 16 and
18 degrees (between 128 and 144 degrees reaum) which is equally
favourable to the plantain the orange-tree the coffee-tree the
apple the apricot and corn? jose de oviedo y banos the
historiographer of venezuela calls the situation of caracas that
of a terrestrial paradise and compares the anauco and the
neighbouring torrents to the four rivers of the garden of eden

it is to be regretted that this delightful climate is generally
inconstant and variable the inhabitants of caracas complain of
having several seasons in one and the same day and of the rapid
change from one season to another in the month of january for
instance a night of which the mean temperature is 16 degrees is
sometimes followed by a day when the thermometer during eight
successive hours keeps above 22 degrees in the shade in the same
day we may find the temperature of 24 and 18 degrees these
variations are extremely common in our temperate climates of
europe but in the torrid zone europeans themselves are so
accustomed to the uniform action of exterior stimulus that they
suffer from a change of temperature of 6 degrees at cumana and
everywhere in the plains the temperature from eleven in the
morning to eleven at night changes only 2 or 3 degrees moreover
these variations act on the human frame at caracas more violently
than might be supposed from the mere indications of the
thermometer in this narrow valley the atmosphere is in some sort
balanced between two winds one blowing from the west or the
seaside the other from the east or the inland country the first
is known by the name of the wind of catia because it blows from
catia westward of cabo blanco through the ravine of tipe it is
however only a westerly wind in appearance and it is oftener the
breeze of the east and north-east which rushing with extreme
impetuosity engulfs itself in the quebrada de tipe rebounding
from the high mountains of aguas negras this wind finds its way
back to caracas in the direction of the hospital of the capuchins
and the rio caraguata it is loaded with vapours which it deposits
as its temperature decreases and consequently the summit of the
silla is enveloped in clouds when the catia blows in the valley
this wind is dreaded by the inhabitants of caracas it causes
headache in persons whose nervous system is irritable in order to
shun its effects people sometimes shut themselves up in their
houses as they do in italy when the sirocco is blowing i thought
i perceived during my stay at caracas that the wind of catia was
purer (a little richer in oxygen) than the wind of petare i even
imagined that its purity might explain its exciting property the
wind of petare coming from the east and south-east by the eastern
extremity of the valley of the guayra brings from the mountains
and the interior of the country a drier air which dissipates the
clouds and the summit of the silla rises in all its beauty

we know that the modifications produced by winds in the composition
of the air in various places entirely escape our eudiometrical
experiments the most precise of which can estimate only as far
as 0003 degrees of oxygen chemistry does not yet possess any
means of distinguishing two jars of air the one filled during the
prevalence of the sirocco or the catia and the other before these
winds have commenced it appears to me probable that the singular
effects of the catia and of all those currents of air to the
influence of which popular opinion attaches so much importance
must be looked for rather in the changes of humidity and of
temperature than in chemical modifications we need not trace
miasms to caracas from the unhealthy shore on the coast it may be
easily conceived that men accustomed to the drier air of the
mountains and the interior must be disagreeably affected when the
very humid air of the sea pressed through the gap of tipe reaches
in an ascending current the high valley of caracas and getting
cooler by dilatation and by contact with the adjacent strata
deposits a great portion of the water it contains this inconstancy
of climate these somewhat rapid transitions from dry and
transparent to humid and misty air are inconveniences which
caracas shares in common with the whole temperate region of the
tropics with all places situated between four and eight hundred
toises of elevation either on table-lands of small extent or on
the slope of the cordilleras as at xalapa in mexico and guaduas
in new granada a serenity uninterrupted during a great part of
the year prevails only in the low regions at the level of the sea
and at considerable heights on those vast table-lands where the
uniform radiation of the soil seems to contribute to the perfect
dissolution of vesicular vapours the intermediate zone is at the
same height as the first strata of clouds which surround the
surface of the earth and the climate of this zone the temperature
of which is so mild is essentially misty and variable

notwithstanding the elevation of the spot the sky is generally
less blue at caracas than at cumana the aqueous vapour is less
perfectly dissolved and here as in our climates a greater
diffusion of light diminishes the intensity of the aerial colour
by introducing white into the blue of the air this intensity
measured with the cyanometer of saussure was found from november
to january generally 18 never above 20 degrees on the coasts it
was from 22 to 25 degrees i remarked in the village of caracas
that the wind of petare sometimes contributes singularly to give a
pale tint to the celestial vault on the 22nd of january the blue
of the sky was at noon in the zenith feebler than i ever saw it in
the torrid zone* (* at noon thermometer in the shade 237 (in the
sun out of the wind 304 degrees) de luc's hygrometer 362
cyanometer at the zenith 12 at the horizon 9 degrees the wind
ceased at three in the afternoon thermometer 21 hygrometer 393
cyanometer 16 degrees at six o'clock thermometer 202 hygrometer
39 degrees) it corresponded only to 12 degrees of the cyanometer
the atmosphere was then remarkably transparent without clouds and
of extraordinary dryness the moment the wind of petare ceased the
blue colour rose at the zenith as high as 16 degrees i have often
observed at sea but in a smaller degree a similar effect of the
wind on the colour of the serenest sky

we know less exactly the mean temperature of caracas than that of
santa fe de bogota and of mexico i believe however i can
demonstrate that it cannot be very distant from twenty to
twenty-two degrees i found by my own observations during the
three very cool months of november december and january taking
each day the maximum and minimum of the temperature the heights
were 202 201 202 degrees

rains are extremely frequent at caracas in the months of april
may and june the storms always come from the east and south-east
from the direction of petare and la valle no hail falls in the low
regions of the tropics yet it occurs at caracas almost every four
or five years hail has even been seen in valleys still lower and
this phenomenon when it does happen makes a powerful impression
on the people falls of aerolites are less rare with us than hail
in the torrid zone notwithstanding the frequency of thunder-storms
at the elevation of three hundred toises above the level of the
sea

the cool and delightful climate we have just been describing is
also suited for the culture of equinoctial productions the
sugar-cane is reared with success even at heights exceeding that
of caracas but in the valley owing to the dryness of the climate
and the stony soil the cultivation of the coffee-tree is
preferred it yields indeed but little fruit but that little is of
the finest quality when the shrub is in blossom the plain
extending beyond chacao presents a delightful aspect the
banana-tree which is seen in the plantations near the town is not
the great platano harton but the varieties camburi and dominico
which require less heat the great plantains are brought to the
market of caracas from the haciendas of turiamo situated on the
coast between burburata and porto cabello the finest flavoured
pine-apples are those of baruto of empedrado and of the heights
of buenavista on the road to victoria when a traveller for the
first time visits the valley of caracas he is agreeably surprised
to find the culinary plants of our climates as well as the
strawberry the vine and almost all the fruit-trees of the
temperate zone growing beside the coffee and banana-tree the
apples and peaches esteemed the best come from macarao or from the
western extremity of the valley there the quince-tree the trunk
of which attains only four or five feet in height is so common
that it has almost become wild preserved apples and quinces
particularly the latter* (* "dulce de manzana y de membrillo" are
the spanish names of these preserves) are much used in a country
where it is thought that before drinking water thirst should be
excited by sweetmeats in proportion as the environs of the town
have been planted with coffee and the establishment of plantations
(which dates only from the year 1795) has increased the number of
agricultural negroes* the apple and quince-trees scattered in the
savannahs have given place in the valley of caracas to maize and
pulse (* the consumption of provisions especially meat is so
considerable in the towns of spanish america that at caracas in
1800 there were 40000 oxen killed every year while in paris in
1793 with a population fourteen times as great the number
amounted only to 70000) rice watered by means of small trenches
was formerly more common than it now is in the plain of chacao i
observed in this province as in mexico and in all the elevated
lands of the torrid zone that where the apple-tree is most
abundant the culture of the pear-tree is attended with great
difficulty i have been assured that near caracas the excellent
apples sold in the markets come from trees not grafted there are
no cherry-trees the olive-trees which i saw in the court of the
convent of san felipe de neri were large and fine but the
luxuriance of their vegetation prevented them from bearing fruit

if the atmospheric constitution of the valley be favourable to the
different kinds of culture on which colonial industry is based it
is not equally favourable to the health of the inhabitants or to
that of foreigners settled in the capital of venezuela the extreme
inconstancy of the weather and the frequent suppression of
cutaneous perspiration give birth to catarrhal affections which
assume the most various forms a european once accustomed to the
violent heat enjoys better health at cumana in the valley of
aragua and in every place where the low region of the tropics is
not very humid than at caracas and in those mountain-climates
which are vaunted as the abode of perpetual spring

speaking of the yellow fever of la guayra i mentioned the opinion
generally adopted that this disease is propagated as little from
the coast of venezuela to the capital as from the coast of mexico
to xalapa this opinion is founded on the experience of the last
twenty years the contagious disorders which were severely felt in
the port of la guayra were scarcely felt at caracas i am not
convinced that the american typhus rendered endemic on the coast
as the port becomes more frequented if favoured by particular
dispositions of the climate may not become common in the valley
for the mean temperature of caracas is considerable enough to allow
the thermometer in the hottest months to keep between twenty-two
and twenty-six degrees the situation of xalapa on the declivity
of the mexican mountains promises more security because that town
is less populous and is five times farther distant from the sea
than caracas and two hundred and thirty toises higher its mean
temperature being three degrees cooler in 1696 a bishop of
venezuela diego de banos dedicated a church (ermita) to santa
rosalia of palermo for having delivered the capital from the
scourge of the black vomit (vomito negro) which is said to have
raged for the space of sixteen months a mass celebrated every year
in the cathedral in the beginning of september perpetuates the
remembrance of this epidemic in the same manner as processions
fix in the spanish colonies the date of the great earthquakes
the year 1696 was indeed very remarkable for the yellow fever
which raged with violence in all the west india islands where it
had only begun to gain an ascendancy in 1688 but how can we give
credit to an epidemical black vomit having lasted sixteen months
without interruption and which may be said to have passed through
that very cool season when the thermometer at caracas falls to
twelve or thirteen degrees? can the typhus be of older date in the
elevated valley of caracas than in the most frequented ports of
terra firma according to ulloa it was unknown in terra firma
before 1729 i doubt therefore the epidemic of 1696 having been
the yellow fever or real typhus of america some of the symptoms
which accompany yellow fever are common to bilious remittent
fevers and are no more characteristic than haematemeses of that
severe disease now known at the havannah and vera cruz by the name
of vomito but though no accurate description satisfactorily
demonstrates that the typhus of america existed at caracas as early
as the end of the seventeenth century it is unhappily too certain
that this disease carried off in that capital a great number of
european soldiers in 1802 we are filled with dismay when we
reflect that in the centre of the torrid zone a table-land four
hundred and fifty toises high but very near the sea does not
secure the inhabitants against a scourge which was believed to
belong only to the low regions of the coast

abode at caracas
mountains in the vicinity of the town
excursion to the summit of the silla
indications of mines

i remained two months at caracas where m bonpland and i lived in
a large house in the most elevated part of the town from a gallery
we could survey at once the summit of the silla the serrated ridge
of the galipano and the charming valley of the guayra the rich
culture of which was pleasingly contrasted with the gloomy curtain
of the surrounding mountains it was in the dry season and to
improve the pasturage the savannahs and the turf covering the
steepest rocks were set on fire these vast conflagrations viewed
from a distance produce the most singular effects of light
wherever the savannahs following the undulating slope of the
rocks have filled up the furrows hollowed out by the waters the
flame appears in a dark night like currents of lava suspended over
the valley the vivid but steady light assumes a reddish tint when
the wind descending from the silla accumulates streams of vapour
in the low regions at other times (and this effect is still more
curious) these luminous bands enveloped in thick clouds appear
only at intervals where it is clear and as the clouds ascend
their edges reflect a splendid light these various phenomena so
common in the tropics acquire additional interest from the form of
the mountains the direction of the slopes and the height of the
savannahs covered with alpine grasses during the day the wind of
petare blowing from the east drives the smoke towards the town
and diminishes the transparency of the air

if we had reason to be satisfied with the situation of our house
we had still greater cause for satisfaction in the reception we met
with from all classes of the inhabitants though i have had the
advantage which few spaniards have shared with me of having
successively visited caracas the havannah santa fe de bogota
quito lima and mexico and of having been connected in these six
capitals of spanish america with men of all ranks i will not
venture to decide on the various degrees of civilization which
society has attained in the several colonies it is easier to
indicate the different shades of national improvement and the
point towards which intellectual development tends than to compare
and class things which cannot all be considered under one point of
view it appeared to me that a strong tendency to the study of
science prevailed at mexico and santa fe de bogota more taste for
literature and whatever can charm an ardent and lively
imagination at quito and lima more accurate notions of the
political relations of countries and more enlarged views on the
state of colonies and their mother-countries at the havannah and
caracas the numerous communications with commercial europe with
the caribbean sea (which we have described as a mediterranean with
many outlets) have exercised a powerful influence on the progress
of society in the five provinces of venezuela and in the island of
cuba in no other part of spanish america has civilization assumed
a more european character the great number of indian cultivators
who inhabit mexico and the interior of new grenada impart a
peculiar i may almost say an exotic aspect on those vast
countries notwithstanding the increase of the black population we
seem to be nearer to cadiz and the united states at caracas and
the havannah than in any other part of the new world

when in the reign of charles v social distinctions and their
consequent rivalries were introduced from the mother-country to the
colonies there arose in cumana and in other commercial towns of
terra firma exaggerated pretensions to nobility on the part of
some of the most illustrious families of caracas distinguished by
the designation of los mantuanos the progress of knowledge and
the consequent change in manners have however gradually and
pretty generally neutralized whatever is offensive in those
distinctions among the whites in all the spanish colonies there
exist two kinds of nobility one is composed of creoles whose
ancestors only from a very recent period filled great stations in
america their prerogatives are partly founded on the distinction
they enjoy in the mother-country and they imagine they can retain
those distinctions beyond the sea whatever may be the date of
their settlement in the colonies the other class of nobility has
more of an american character it is composed of the descendants of
the conquistadores that is to say of the spaniards who served in
the army at the time of the first conquest among the warriors who
fought with cortez losada and pizarro several belonged to the
most distinguished families of the peninsula others sprung from
the inferior classes of the people have shed lustre on their
names by that chivalrous spirit which prevailed at the beginning
of the sixteenth century in the records of those times of
religious and military enthusiasm we find among the followers of
the great captains many simple virtuous and generous characters
who reprobated the cruelties which then stained the glory of the
spanish name but who being confounded in the mass have not
escaped the general proscription the name of conquistadares
remains the more odious as the greater number of them after
having outraged peaceful nations and lived in opulence did not
end their career by suffering those misfortunes which appease the
indignation of mankind and sometimes soothe the severity of the
historian

but it is not only the progress of ideas and the conflict between
two classes of different origin which have induced the privileged
castes to abandon their pretensions or at least cautiously to
conceal them aristocracy in the spanish colonies has a
counterpoise of another kind the action of which becomes every day
more powerful a sentiment of equality among the whites has
penetrated every bosom wherever men of colour are either
considered as slaves or as having been enfranchised that which
constitutes nobility is hereditary liberty the proud boast of
having never reckoned among ancestors any but freemen in the
colonies the colour of the skin is the real badge of nobility in
mexico as well as peru at caracas as in the island of cuba a
bare-footed fellow with a white skin is often heard to exclaim
"does that rich man think himself whiter than i am?" the population
which europe pours into america being very considerable it may
easily be supposed that the axiom 'every white man is noble'
(todo blanco es caballero) must singularly wound the pretensions
of many ancient and illustrious european families but it may be
further observed that the truth of this axiom has long since been
acknowledged in spain among a people justly celebrated for
probity industry and national spirit every biscayan calls
himself noble and there being a greater number of biscayans in
america and the philippine islands than in the peninsula the
whites of that race have contributed in no small degree to
propagate in the colonies the system of equality among all men
whose blood has not been mixed with that of the african race

moreover the countries of which the inhabitants even without a
representative government or any institution of peerage annex so
much importance to genealogy and the advantages of birth are not
always those in which family aristocracy is most offensive we do
not find among the natives of spanish origin that cold and
assuming air which the character of modern civilization seems to
have rendered less common in spain than in the rest of europe
conviviality candour and great simplicity of manner unite the
different classes of society in the colonies as well as in the
mother-country it may even be said that the expression of vanity
and self-love becomes less offensive when it retains something of
simplicity and frankness

i found in several families at caracas a love of information an
acquaintance with the masterpieces of french and italian
literature and a marked predilection for music which is greatly
cultivated and which (as always results from a taste for the fine
arts) brings the different classes of society nearer to each other
the mathematical sciences drawing and painting cannot here boast
of any of those establishments with which royal munificence and the
patriotic zeal of the inhabitants have enriched mexico in the
midst of the marvels of nature so rich in interesting productions
it is strange that we found no person on this coast devoted to the
study of plants and minerals in a franciscan convent i met it is
true with an old monk who drew up the almanac for all the
provinces of venezuela and who possessed some accurate knowledge
of astronomy our instruments interested him deeply and one day
our house was filled with all the monks of san francisco begging
to see a dipping-needle the curiosity excited by physical
phenomena is naturally great in countries undermined by volcanic
fires and in a climate where nature is at once so majestic and so
mysteriously convulsed

when we remember that in the united states of north america
newspapers are published in small towns not containing more than
three thousand inhabitants it seems surprising that caracas with
a population of forty or fifty thousand souls should have
possessed no printing office before 1806 for we cannot give the
name of a printing establishment to a few presses which served only
from year to year to promulgate an almanac of a few pages or the
pastoral letter of a bishop though the number of those who feel
reading to be a necessity is not very considerable even in the
spanish colonies most advanced in civilization yet it would be
unjust to reproach the colonists for a state of intellectual
lassitude which has been the result of a jealous policy a
frenchman named delpeche has the merit of having established the
first printing office in caracas it appears somewhat extraordinary
that an establishment of this kind should have followed and not
preceded a political revolution

in a country abounding in such magnificent scenery and at a period
when notwithstanding some symptoms of popular commotion most of
the inhabitants seem only to direct attention to physical objects
such as the fertility of the year the long drought or the
conflicting winds of petare and catia i expected to find many
individuals well acquainted with the lofty surrounding mountains
but i was disappointed and we could not find in caracas a single
person who had visited the summit of the silla hunters do not
ascend so high on the ridges of mountains and in these countries
journeys are not undertaken for such purposes as gathering alpine
plants carrying a barometer to an elevated point or examining the
nature of rocks accustomed to a uniform and domestic life the
people dread fatigue and sudden changes of climate they seem to
live not to enjoy life but only to prolong it

our walks led us often in the direction of two coffee plantations
the proprietors of which don andres de ibarra and m blandin were
men of agreeable manners these plantations were situated opposite
the silla de caracas surveying by a telescope the steep
declivity of the mountains and the form of the two peaks by which
it is terminated we could form an idea of the difficulties we
should have to encounter in reaching its summit angles of
elevation taken with the sextant at our house had led me to
believe that the summit was not so high above sea-level as the
great square of quito this estimate was far from corresponding
with the notions entertained by the inhabitants of the city
mountains which command great towns have acquired from that very
circumstance an extraordinary celebrity in both continents long
before they have been accurately measured a conventional height is
assigned to them and to entertain the least doubt respecting that
height is to wound a national prejudice

the captain-general senor de guevara directed the teniente of
chacao to furnish us with guides to conduct us on our ascent of the
silla these guides were negroes and they knew something of the
path leading over the ridge of the mountain near the western peak
of the silla this path is frequented by smugglers but neither the
guides nor the most experienced of the militia accustomed to
pursue the smugglers in these wild spots had been on the eastern
peak forming the most elevated summit of the silla during the
whole month of december the mountain (of which the angles of
elevation made me acquainted with the effects of the terrestrial
refractions) had appeared only five times free of clouds in this
season two serene days seldom succeed each other and we were
therefore advised not to choose a clear day for our excursion but
rather a time when the clouds not being elevated we might hope
after having crossed the first layer of vapours uniformly spread
to enter into a dry and transparent air we passed the night of the
2nd of january in the estancia de gallegos a plantation of
coffee-trees near which the little river of chacaito flowing in a
luxuriantly shaded ravine forms some fine cascades in descending
the mountains the night was pretty clear and though on the day
preceding a fatiguing journey it might have been well to have
enjoyed some repose m bonpland and i passed the whole night in
watching three occultations of the satellites of jupiter i had
previously determined the instant of the observation but we missed
them all owing to some error of calculation in the connaissance
des temps the apparent time had been mistaken for mean time

i was much disappointed by this accident and after having observed
at the foot of the mountain the intensity of the magnetic forces
before sunrise we set out at five in the morning accompanied by
slaves carrying our instruments our party consisted of eighteen
persons and we all walked one behind another in a narrow path
traced on a steep acclivity covered with turf we endeavoured
first to reach a hill which towards the south-east seems to form a
promontory of the silla it is connected with the body of the
mountain by a narrow dyke called by the shepherds the gate or
puerta de la silla we reached this dyke about seven the morning
was fine and cool and the sky till then seemed to favour our
excursion i saw that the thermometer kept a little below 14
degrees (112 degrees reaum) the barometer showed that we were
already six hundred and eighty-five toises above the level of the
sea that is nearly eighty toises higher than at the venta where
we enjoyed so magnificent a view of the coast our guides thought
that it would require six hours more to reach the summit of the
silla

we crossed a narrow dyke of rocks covered with turf which led us
from the promontory of the puerta to the ridge of the great
mountain here the eye looks down on two valleys or rather narrow
defiles filled with thick vegetation on the right is perceived
the ravine which descends between the two peaks to the farm of
munoz on the left we see the defile of chacaito with its waters
flowing out near the farm of gallegos the roaring of the cascades
is heard while the water is unseen being concealed by thick
groves of erythrina clusia and the indian fig-tree* (* ficus
nymphaeifolia erythrina mitis two fine species of mimosa are
found in the same valley inga fastuosa and i cinerea) nothing
can be more picturesque in a climate where so many plants have
broad large shining and coriaceous leaves than the aspect of
trees when the spectator looks down from a great height above them
and when they are illumined by the almost perpendicular rays of the
sun

from the puerta de la silla the steepness of the ascent increases
and we were obliged to incline our bodies considerably forwards as
we advanced the slope is often from 30 to 32 degrees* (* since my
experiments on slopes mentioned above in chapter 12 i have
discovered in the figure de la terre of bouguer a passage which
shows that this astronomer whose opinions are of such weight
considered also 36 degrees as the inclination of a slope quite
inaccessible if the nature of the ground did not admit of forming
steps with the foot) we felt the want of cramp-irons or sticks
shod with iron short grass covered the rocks of gneiss and it was
equally impossible to hold by the grass or to form steps as we
might have done in softer ground this ascent which was attended
with more fatigue than danger discouraged those who accompanied us
from the town and who were unaccustomed to climb mountains we
lost a great deal of time in waiting for them and we did not
resolve to proceed alone till we saw them descending the mountain
instead of climbing up it the weather was becoming cloudy the
mist already issued in the form of smoke and in slender and
perpendicular streaks from a small humid wood which bordered the
region of alpine savannahs above us it seemed as if a fire had
burst forth at once on several points of the forest these streaks
of vapour gradually accumulated together and rising above the
ground were carried along by the morning breeze and glided like a
light cloud over the rounded summit of the mountain

m bonpland and i foresaw from these infallible signs that we
should soon be covered by a thick fog and lest our guides should
take advantage of this circumstance and leave us we obliged those
who carried the most necessary instruments to precede us we
continued climbing the slopes which lead towards the ravine of
chacaito the familiar loquacity of the creole blacks formed a
striking contrast with the taciturn gravity of the indians who had
constantly accompanied us in the missions of caripe the negroes
amused themselves by laughing at the persons who had been in such
haste to abandon an expedition so long in preparation above all
they did not spare a young capuchin monk a professor of
mathematics who never ceased to boast of the superior physical
strength and courage possessed by all classes of european spaniards
over those born in spanish america he had provided himself with
long slips of white paper which were to be cut and flung on the
savannah to indicate to those who might stray behind the
direction they ought to follow the professor had even promised the
friars of his order to fire off some rockets to announce to the
whole town of caracas that we had succeeded in an enterprise which
to him appeared of the utmost importance he had forgotten that his
long and heavy garments would embarrass him in the ascent having
lost courage long before the creoles he passed the rest of the day
in a neighbouring plantation gazing at us through a glass directed
to the silla as we climbed the mountain unfortunately for us he
had taken charge of the water and the provision so necessary in an
excursion to the mountains the slaves who were to rejoin us were
so long detained by him that they arrived very late and we were
ten hours without either bread or water

the eastern peak is the most elevated of the two which form the
summit of the mountain and to this we directed our course with our
instruments the hollow between these two peaks has suggested the
spanish name of silla (saddle) which is given to the whole
mountain the narrow defile which we have already mentioned
descends from this hollow toward the valley of caracas commencing
near the western dome the eastern summit is accessible only by
going first to the west of the ravine over the promontory of the
puerta proceeding straight forward to the lower summit and not
turning to the east till the ridge or the hollow of the silla
between the two peaks is nearly reached the general aspect of the
mountain points out this path the rocks being so steep on the east
of the ravine that it would be extremely difficult to reach the
summit of the silla by ascending straight to the eastern dome
instead of going by the way of the puerta

from the foot of the cascade of chacaito to one thousand toises of
elevation we found only savannahs two small liliaceous plants
with yellow flowers* alone lift up their heads among the grasses
which cover the rocks (* cypura martinicensis and sisyrinchium
iridifolium this last is found also near the venta of la guayra
at 600 toises of elevation) a few brambles* (* rubus jamaicensis)
remind us of the form of our european vegetation we in vain hoped
to find on the mountains of caracas and subsequently on the back
of the andes an eglantine near these brambles we did not find one
indigenous rose-tree in all south america notwithstanding the
analogy existing between the climates of the high mountains of the
torrid zone and the climate of our temperate zone it appears that
this charming shrub is wanting in all the southern hemisphere
within and beyond the tropics it was only on the mexican mountains
that we were fortunate enough to discover in the nineteenth degree
of latitude american eglantines* (* m redoute in his superb
work on rose-trees has given our mexican eglantine under the name
of rosier de montezuma montezuma rose)

we were sometimes so enveloped in mist that we could not without
difficulty find our way at this height there is no path and we
were obliged to climb with our hands when our feet failed us on
the steep and slippery acclivity a vein filled with porcelain-clay
attracted our attention* (* the breadth of the vein is three feet
this porcelain-clay when moistened readily absorbs oxygen from
the atmosphere i found at caracas the residual nitrogen very
slightly mingled with carbonic acid though the experiment was made
in phials with ground-glass stoppers not filled with water) it is
of snowy whiteness and is no doubt the remains of a decomposed
feldspar i forwarded a considerable portion of it to the intendant
of the province in a country where fuel is not scarce a mixture
of refractory earths may be useful to improve the earthenware and
even the bricks every time that the clouds surrounded us the
thermometer sunk as low as 12 degrees (to 96 degrees r) with a
serene sky it rose to 21 degrees these observations were made in
the shade but it is difficult on such rapid declivities covered
with a dry shining yellow turf to avoid the effects of radiant
heat we were at nine hundred and forty toises of elevation and
yet at the same height towards the east we perceived in a ravine
not merely a few solitary palm-trees but a whole grove it was the
palma real probably a species of the genus oreodoxa this group of
palms at so considerable an elevation formed a striking contrast
with the willows* scattered on the depth of the more temperate
valley of caracas (* salix humboldtiana of willdenouw on the
alpine palm-trees see my prolegomena de dist plant page 235) we
here discovered plants of european forms situated below those of
the torrid zone

after proceeding for the space of four hours across the savannahs
we entered into a little wood composed of shrubs and small trees
called el pejual doubtless from the great abundance here of the
pejoa (gaultheria odorata) a plant with very odoriferous leaves*
(* it is a great advantage of the spanish language and a
peculiarity which it shares in common with the latin that from
the name of a tree may be derived a word designating an
association or group of trees of the same species thus are formed
the words olivar robledar and pinal from olivo roble and pino
the hispano-americans have added tunal pejual guayaval etc
places where a great many cactuses gualtheria odoratas and
psidiums grow together) the steepness of the mountain became less
considerable and we felt an indescribable pleasure in examining
the plants of this region nowhere perhaps can be found collected
together in so small a space productions so beautiful and so
remarkable in regard to the geography of plants at the height of a
thousand toises the lofty savannahs of the hills terminate in a
zone of shrubs which by their appearance their tortuous branches
their stiff leaves and the magnitude and beauty of their purple
flowers remind us of what is called in the cordilleras of the
andes the vegetation of the paramos and the punas* (* for the
explanation of these words see above chapter 15) we there find
the family of the alpine rhododendrons the thibaudias the
andromedas the vacciniums and those befarias with resinous
leaves which we have several times compared to the rhododendron of
our european alps

even when nature does not produce the same species in analogous
climates either in the plains of isothermal parallels* (we may
compare together either latitudes which in the same hemisphere
present the same mean temperature (as for instance pennsylvania
and the central part of france chile and the southern part of new
holland) or we may consider the relations that may exist between
the vegetation of the two hemispheres under isothermal parallels)
or on table-lands the temperature of which resembles that of
places nearer the poles* we still remark a striking resemblance of
appearance and physiognomy in the vegetation of the most distant
countries (* the geography of plants comprises not merely an
examination of the analogies observed in the same hemisphere as
between the vegetation of the pyrenees and that of the scandinavian
plains or between that of the cordilleras of peru and of the
coasts of chile it also investigates the relations between the
alpine plants of both hemispheres it compares the vegetation of
the alleghanies and the cordilleras of mexico with that of the
mountains of chile and brazil bearing in mind that every
isothermal line has an alpine branch (as for instance that which
connects upsala with a point in the swiss alps) the great problem
of the analogy of vegetable forms may be defined as follows 1st
examining in each hemisphere and at the level of the coasts the
vegetation on the same isothermal line especially near convex or
concave summits 2nd comparing with respect to the form of
plants on the same isothermal line north and south of the equator
the alpine branch with that traced in the plains 3rd comparing
the vegetation on homonymous isothermal lines in the two
hemispheres either in the low regions or in the alpine regions)
this phenomenon is one of the most curious in the history of
organic forms i say the history for in vain would reason forbid
man to form hypotheses on the origin of things he still goes on
puzzling himself with insoluble problems relating to the
distribution of beings

a gramen of switzerland grows on the granitic rocks of the straits
of magellan* (* phleum alpinum examined by mr brown the
investigations of this great botanist prove that a certain number
of plants are at once common to both hemispheres potentilla
anserina prunella vulgaris scirpus mucronatus and panicum
crus-galli grow in germany in australia and in pennsylvania)
new holland contains above forty european phanerogamous plants and
the greater number of those plants which are found equally in the
temperate zones of both hemispheres are entirely wanting in the
intermediary or equinoctial region as well in the plains as on the
mountains a downy-leaved violet which terminates in some sort the
zone of the phanerogamous plants at teneriffe and which was long
thought peculiar to that island* is seen three hundred leagues
farther north near the snowy summit of the pyrenees (* the viola
cheiranthifolia has been found by mm kunth and von buch among the
alpine plants which jussieu brought from the pyrenees) gramina and
cyperaceous plants of germany arabia and senegal have been
recognized among those that were gathered by m bonpland and myself
on the cold table-lands of mexico along the burning shores of the
orinoco and in the southern hemisphere on the andes and quito* (*
cyperus mucronatus poa eragrostis festuca myurus andropogos
avenaceus lapago racemosa (see the nova genera et species
plantarum volume 1 page 25)) how can we conceive the migration of
plants through regions now covered by the ocean? how have the germs
of organic life which resemble each other in their appearance and
even in their internal structure unfolded themselves at unequal
distances from the poles and from the surface of the seas wherever
places so distant present any analogy of temperature?
notwithstanding the influence exercised on the vital functions of
plants by the pressure of the air and the greater or less
extinction of light heat unequally distributed in different
seasons of the year must doubtless be considered as the most
powerful stimulus of vegetation

the number of identical species in the two continents and in the
two hemispheres is far less than the statements of early travellers
would lead us to believe the lofty mountains of equinoctial
america have certainly plantains valerians arenarias
ranunculuses medlars oaks and pines which from their
physiognomy we might confound with those of europe but they are
all specifically different when nature does not present the same
species she loves to repeat the same genera neighbouring species
are often placed at enormous distances from each other in the low
regions of the temperate zone and on the alpine heights of the
equator at other times (and the silla of caracas affords a
striking example of this phenomenon) they are not the european
genera which have sent species to people like colonists the
mountains of the torrid zone but genera of the same tribe
difficult to be distinguished by their appearance which take the
place of each other in different latitudes

the mountains of new grenada surrounding the table-lands of bogota
are more than two hundred leagues distant from those of caracas
and yet the silla the only elevated peak in the chain of low
mountains presents those singular groupings of befarias with
purple flowers of andromedas of gualtherias of myrtilli of uvas
camaronas* (* the names vine-tree and uvas camaronas are given
in the andes to plants of the genus thibaudia on account of their
large succulent fruits thus the ancient botanists gave the name of
bear's vine uva ursi and vine of mount ida (vitis idaea) to an
arbutus and a myrtillus which belong like the thibaudia to the
family of the ericineae) of nerteras and of aralias with hoary
leaves* (* nertera depressa aralia reticulata hedyotis
blaerioides) which characterize the vegetation of the paramos on
the high cordilleras of santa fe we found the same thibaudia
glandulosa at the entrance of the table-land of bogota and in the
pejual of the silla the coast-chain of caracas is unquestionably
connected (by the torito the palomera tocuyo and the paramos of
rosas of bocono and of niquitao) with the high cordilleras of
merida pamplona and santa fe but from the silla to tocuyo along
a distance of seventy leagues the mountains of caracas are so low
that the shrubs of the family of the ericineous plants just cited
do not find the cold climate which is necessary for their
development supposing as is probable that the thibaudias and the
rhododendron of the andes or befaria exist in the paramo of
niquitao and in the sierra de merida covered with eternal snow
these plants would nevertheless want a ridge sufficiently lofty and
long for their migration towards the silla of caracas

the more we study the distribution of organized beings on the
globe the more we are inclined if not to abandon the ideas of
migration at least to consider them as hypotheses not entirely
satisfactory the chain of the andes divides the whole of south
america into two unequal longitudinal parts at the foot of this
chain on the east and west we found a great number of plants
specifically the same the various passages of the cordilleras
nowhere permit the vegetable productions of the warm regions to
proceed from the coasts of the pacific to the banks of the amazon
when a peak attains a great elevation either in the middle of very
low mountains and plains or in the centre of an archipelago heaved
up by volcanic fires its summit is covered with alpine plants
many of which are again found at immense distances on other
mountains having an analogous climate such are the general
phenomena of the distribution of plants

it is now said that a mountain is high enough to enter into the
limits of the rhododendrons and the befarias as it has long been
said that such a mountain reached the limit of perpetual snow in
using this expression it is tacitly admitted that under the
influence of certain temperatures certain vegetable forms must
necessarily be developed such a supposition however taken in all
its generality is not strictly accurate the pines of mexico are
wanting on the cordilleras of peru the silla of caracas is not
covered with the oaks which flourish in new grenada at the same
height identity of forms indicates an analogy of climate but in
similar climates the species may be singularly diversified

the charming rhododendron of the andes (the befaria) was first
described by m mutis who observed it near pamplona and santa fe
de bogota in the fourth and seventh degree of north latitude it
was so little known before our expedition to the silla that it was
scarcely to be found in any herbal in europe the learned editors
of the flora of peru had even described it under another name that
of acunna in the same manner as the rhododendrons of lapland
caucasus and the alps* (* rhododendron lapponicum r caucasicum
r ferrugineum and r hirsutum) differ from each other the two
species of befaria we brought from the silla* (* befaria glauca b
ledifolia) are also specifically different from that of santa fe
and bogota* (* befaria aestuans and b resinosa) near the
equator the rhododendrons of the andes (particularly b aestuans of
mutis and two new species of the southern hemisphere which we
have described under the name of b coarctata and b grandiflora)
cover the mountains as far as the highest paramos at sixteen and
seventeen hundred toises of elevation advancing northward on the
silla de caracas we find them much lower a little below one
thousand toises the befaria recently discovered in florida in
latitude 30 degrees grows even on hills of small elevation thus
in a space of six hundred leagues in latitude these shrubs descend
towards the plains in proportion as their distance from the equator
augments the rhododendron of lapland grows also at eight or nine
hundred toises lower than the rhododendron of the alps and the
pyrenees we were surprised at not meeting with any species of
befaria in the mountains of mexico between the rhododendrons of
santa fe and caracas and those of florida

in the small grove which crowns the silla the befaria ledifolia is
only three or four feet high the trunk is divided from its root
into a great many slender and even verticillate branches the
leaves are oval lanceolate glaucous on their inferior part and
curled at the edges the whole plant is covered with long and
viscous hairs and emits a very agreeable resinous smell the bees
visit its fine purple flowers which are very abundant as in all
the alpine plants and when in full blossom they are often nearly

the rhododendron of switzerland in those places where it grows at
the elevation of between eight hundred and a thousand toises
belongs to a climate the mean temperature of which is +2 and-1
degrees like that of the plains of lapland in this zone the
coldest months are-4 and-10 degrees the hottest 12 and 7
degrees thermometrical observations made at the same heights and
in the same latitudes render it probable that at the pejual of
the silla one thousand toises above the caribbean sea the mean
temperature of the air is still 17 or 18 degrees and that the
thermometer keeps in the coolest season between 15 and 20 degrees
in the day and in the night between 10 and 12 degrees at the
hospital of st gothard situated nearly on the highest limit of
the rhododendron of the alps the maximum of heat in the month of
august at noon in the shade is usually 12 or 13 degrees in the
night at the same season the air is cooled by the radiation of
the soil down to +1 or-15 degrees under the same barometric
pressure consequently at the same height but thirty degrees of
latitude nearer the equator the befaria of the silla is often at
noon in the sun exposed to a heat of 23 or 24 degrees the
greatest nocturnal refrigeration probably never exceeds 7 degrees
we have carefully compared the climate under the influence of
which at different latitudes two groups of plants of the same
family vegetate at equal heights above the level of the sea the
results would have been far different had we compared zones
equally distant either from the perpetual snow or from the
isothermal line of 0 degrees* (* the stratum of air the mean
temperature of which is 0 degrees and which scarcely coincides
with the superior limit of perpetual snow is found in the parallel
of the rhododendrons of switzerland at nine hundred toises in the
parallel of the befarias of caracas at two thousand seven hundred
toises of elevation)

in the little thicket of the pejual near the purple-flowered
befaria grows a heath-leaved hedyotis eight feet high the
caparosa* which is a large arborescent hypericum (* vismia
caparosa (a loranthus clings to this plant and appropriates to
itself the yellow juice of the vismia) davallia meifolia heracium
avilae aralia arborea jacq and lepidium virginicum two new
species of lycopodium the thyoides and the aristatum are seen
lower down near the puerto de la silla) a lepidium which
appears identical with that of virginia and lastly lycopodiaceous
plants and mosses which cover the rocks and roots of the trees
that which gives most celebrity in the country to the little
thicket is a shrub ten or fifteen feet high of the corymbiferous
family the creoles call it incense (incienso)* (* trixis
nereifolia of m bonpland) its tough and crenate leaves as well
as the extremities of the branches are covered with a white wool
it is a new species of trixis extremely resinous the flowers of
which have the agreeable odour of storax this smell is very
different from that emitted by the leaves of the trixis
terebinthinacea of the mountains of jamaica opposite to those of
caracas the people sometimes mix the incienso of the silla with
the flowers of the pevetera another composite plant the smell of
which resembles that of the heliotropium of peru the pevetera does
not however grow on the mountains so high as the zone of the
befarias it vegetates in the valley of chacao and the ladies of
caracas prepare from it an extremely pleasant odoriferous water

we spent a long time in examining the fine resinous and fragrant
plants of the pejual the sky became more and more cloudy and the
thermometer sank below 11 degrees a temperature at which in this
zone people begin to suffer from the cold quitting the little
thicket of alpine plants we found ourselves again in a savannah
we climbed over a part of the western dome in order to descend
into the hollow of the silla a valley which separates the two
summits of the mountain we there had great difficulties to
overcome occasioned by the force of the vegetation a botanist
would not readily guess that the thick wood covering this valley is
formed by the assemblage of a plant of the musaceous family*
(*scitamineous plants or family of the plantains) it is probably
a maranta or a heliconia its leaves are large and shining it
reaches the height of fourteen or fifteen feet and its succulent
stalks grow near one another like the stems of the reeds found in
the humid regions of the south of europe* (* arundo donax) we
were obliged to cut our way through this forest the negroes walked
before with their cutlasses or machetes the people confound this
alpine scitamineous plant with the arborescent gramina under the
name of carice we saw neither its fruit nor flowers we are
surprised to meet with a monocotyledonous family believed to be
exclusively found in the hot and low regions of the tropics at
eleven hundred toises of elevation much higher than the
andromedas the thibaudias and the rhododendron of the
cordilleras* (* befaria) in a chain of mountains no less
elevated and more northern (the blue mountains of jamaica) the
heliconia of the parrots and the bihai rather grow in the alpine
shaded situations* (* heliconia psittacorum and h bihai these
two heliconias are very common in the plains of terra firma)

wandering in this thick wood of musaceae or arborescent plants we
constantly directed our course towards the eastern peak which we
perceived from time to time through an opening on a sudden we
found ourselves enveloped in a thick mist the compass alone could
guide us but in advancing northward we were in danger at every
step of finding ourselves on the brink of that enormous wall of
rocks which descends almost perpendicularly to the depth of six
thousand feet towards the sea we were obliged to halt surrounded
by clouds sweeping the ground we began to doubt whether we should
reach the eastern peak before night happily the negroes who
carried our water and provisions rejoined us and we resolved to
take some refreshment our repast did not last long possibly the
capuchin father had not thought of the great number of persons who
accompanied us or perhaps the slaves had made free with our
provisions on the way be that as it may we found nothing but
olives and scarcely any bread horace in his retreat at tibur
never boasted of a repast more light and frugal but olives which
might have afforded a satisfactory meal to a poet devoted to
study and leading a sedentary life appeared an aliment by no
means sufficiently substantial for travellers climbing mountains
we had watched the greater part of the night and we walked for
nine hours without finding a single spring our guides were
discouraged they wished to go back and we had great difficulty in
preventing them

in the midst of the mist i made trial of the electrometer of volta
armed with a smoking match though very near a thick wood of
heliconias i obtained very sensible signs of atmospheric
electricity it often varied from positive to negative its
intensity changing every instant these variations and the
conflict of several small currents of air which divided the mist
and transformed it into clouds the borders of which were visible
appeared to me infallible prognostics of a change in the weather
it was only two o'clock in the afternoon we entertained some hope
of reaching the eastern summit of the silla before sunset and of
re-descending into the valley separating the two peaks intending
there to pass the night to light a great fire and to make our
negroes construct a hut with the leaves of the heliconia we sent
off half of our servants with orders to hasten the next morning to
meet us not with olives but with a supply of salt beef

we had scarcely made these arrangements when the east wind began to
blow violently from the sea the thermometer rose to 125 degrees
it was no doubt an ascending wind which by heightening the
temperature dissolved the vapours in less than two minutes the
clouds dispersed and the two domes of the silla appeared to us
singularly near we opened the barometer in the lowest part of the
hollow that separates the two summits near a little pool of very
muddy water here as in the west india islands marshy plains are
found at great elevations not because the woody mountains attract
the clouds but because they condense the vapours by the effect of
nocturnal refrigeration occasioned by the radiation of heat from
the ground and from the parenchyma of the leaves the mercury was
at 21 inches 57 lines we shaped our course direct to the eastern
summit the obstruction caused by the vegetation gradually
diminished it was however necessary to cut down some heliconias
but these arborescent plants were not now very thick or high the
peaks of the silla themselves as we have several times mentioned
are covered only with gramina and small shrubs of befaria their
barrenness however is not owing to their height the limit of
trees in this region is four hundred toises higher since judging
according to the analogy of other mountains this limit would be
found here only at a height of eighteen hundred toises the absence
of large trees on the two rocky summits of the silla may be
attributed to the aridity of the soil the violence of the winds
blowing from the sea and the conflagrations so frequent in all the
mountains of the equinoctial region

to reach the eastern peak which is the highest it is necessary to
approach as near as possible the great precipice which descends
towards caravalleda and the coast the gneiss as far as this spot
preserves its lamellar texture and its primitive direction but
where we climbed the summit of the silla we found it had passed
into granite its texture becomes granular the mica less
frequent is more unequally spread through the rock instead of
garnets we met with a few solitary crystals of hornblende it is
however not a syenite but rather a granite of new formation we
were three quarters of an hour in reaching the summit of the
pyramid this part of the way is not dangerous provided the
traveller carefully examines the stability of each fragment of rock
on which he places his foot the granite superposed on the gneiss
does not present a regular separation into beds it is divided by
clefts which often cross one another at right angles prismatic
blocks one foot wide and twelve long stand out from the ground
obliquely and appear on the edges of the precipice like enormous
beams suspended over the abyss

having arrived at the summit we enjoyed for a few minutes only
the serenity of the sky the eye ranged over a vast extent of
country looking down to the north was the sea and to the south
the fertile valley of caracas the barometer was at 20 inches 76
lines the thermometer at 137 degrees we were at thirteen hundred
and fifty toises of elevation we gazed on an extent of sea the
radius of which was thirty-six leagues persons who are affected by
looking downward from a considerable height should remain at the
centre of the small flat which crowns the eastern summit of the
silla the mountain is not very remarkable for height it is nearly
eighty toises lower than the canigou but it is distinguished among
all the mountains i have visited by an enormous precipice on the
side next the sea the coast forms only a narrow border and
looking from the summit of the pyramid on the houses of
caravalleda this wall of rocks seems by an optical illusion to
be nearly perpendicular the real slope of the declivity appeared
to me according to an exact calculation 53 degrees 28 minutes*
(* observations of the latitude give for the horizontal distance
between the foot of the mountain near caravalleda and the vertical
line passing through its summit scarcely 1000 toises) the mean
slope of the peak of teneriffe is scarcely 12 degrees 30 minutes a
precipice of six or seven thousand feet like that of the silla of
caracas is a phenomenon far more rare than is generally believed
by those who cross mountains without measuring their height their
bulk and their slope since the experiments on the fall of bodies
and on their deviation to the south-east have been resumed in
several parts of europe a rock of two hundred and fifty toises of
perpendicular elevation has been in vain sought for among all the
alps of switzerland the declivity of mont blanc towards the allee
blanche does not even reach an angle of 45 degrees though in the
greater number of geological works mont blanc is described as
perpendicular on the south side

at the silla of caracas the enormous northern cliff is partly
covered with vegetation notwithstanding the extreme steepness of
its slope tufts of befaria and andromedas appear as if suspended
from the rock the little valley which separates the domes towards
the south stretches in the direction of the sea alpine plants
fill this hollow and not confined to the ridge of the mountain
they follow the sinuosities of the ravine it would seem as if
torrents were concealed under that fresh foliage and the
disposition of the plants the grouping of so many inanimate
objects give the landscape all the charm of motion and of life

seven months had now elapsed since we had been on the summit of the
peak of teneriffe whence we surveyed a space of the globe equal to
a fourth part of france the apparent horizon of the sea is there
six leagues farther distant than at the top of the silla and yet
we saw that horizon at least for some time very distinctly it
was strongly marked and not confounded with the adjacent strata of
air at the silla which is five hundred and fifty toises lower
than the peak of teneriffe the horizon though nearer continued
invisible towards the north and north-north-east following with
the eye the surface of the sea which was smooth as glass we were
struck with the progressive diminution of the reflected light
where the visual ray touched the last limit of that surface the
water was lost among the superposed strata of air this appearance
has something in it very extraordinary we expect to see the
horizon level with the eye but instead of distinguishing at this
height a marked limit between the two elements the more distant
strata of water seem to be transformed into vapour and mingled
with the aerial ocean i observed the same appearance not in one
spot of the horizon alone but on an extent of more than a hundred
and sixty degrees along the pacific when i found myself for the
first time on the pointed rock that commands the crater of
pichincha a volcano the elevation of which exceeds that of mont
blanc* (* see views of nature bohn's edition page 358) the
visibility of a very distant horizon depends when there is no
mirage upon two distinct things the quantity of light received on
that part of the sea where the visual ray terminates and the
extinction of the reflected light during its passage through the
intermediate strata of air it may happen notwithstanding the
serenity of the sky and the transparency of the atmosphere that
the ocean is feebly illuminated at thirty or forty leagues'
distance or that the strata of air nearest the earth may
extinguish a great deal of the light by absorbing the rays that
traverse them

the rounded peak or western dome of the silla concealed from us
the view of the town of caracas but we distinguished the nearest
houses the villages of chacao and petare the coffee plantations
and the course of the rio guayra a slender streak of water
reflecting a silvery light the narrow band of cultivated ground
was pleasingly contrasted with the wild and gloomy aspect of the
neighbouring mountains whilst contemplating these grand scenes we
feel little regret that the solitudes of the new world are not
embellished with the monuments of antiquity

but we could not long avail ourselves of the advantage arising from
the position of the silla in commanding all the neighbouring
summits while we were examining with our glasses that part of the
sea the horizon of which was clearly defined and the chain of the
mountains of ocumare behind which begins the unknown world of the
orinoco and the amazon a thick fog from the plains rose to the
elevated regions first filling the bottom of the valley of
caracas the vapours illumined from above presented a uniform
tint of a milky white the valley seemed overspread with water and
looked like an arm of the sea of which the adjacent mountains
formed the steep shore in vain we waited for the slave who carried
ramsden's great sextant eager to avail myself of the favourable
state of the sky i resolved to take a few solar altitudes with a
sextant by troughton of two inches radius the disk of the sun was
half-concealed by the mist the difference of longitude between the
quarter of the trinidad and the eastern peak of the silla appears
scarcely to exceed 0 degrees 3 minutes 22 seconds* (* the difference
of longitude between the silla and la guayra according to fidalgo
is 0 degrees 6 minutes 40 seconds)

whilst seated on the rock i was determining the dip of the
needle i found my hands covered with a species of hairy bee a
little smaller than the honey-bee of the north of europe these
insects make their nests in the ground they seldom fly and from
the slowness of their movements i should have supposed they were
benumbed by the cold of the mountains the people in these
regions call them angelitos (little angels) because they very
seldom sting they are no doubt of the genus apis of the division
melipones it has been erroneously affirmed that these bees which
are peculiar to the new world are destitute of all offensive
weapons their sting is indeed comparatively feeble and they use
it seldom but a person not fully convinced of the harmlessness of
these angelitos can scarcely divest himself of a sensation of
fear i must confess that whilst engaged in my astronomical
observations i was often on the point of letting my instruments
fall when i felt my hands and face covered with these hairy bees
our guides assured us that they attempt to defend themselves only
when irritated by being seized by their legs i was not tempted to
try the experiment on myself

the dip of the needle at the silla was one centesimal degree less
than in the town of caracas in collecting the observations which i
made during calm weather and in very favourable circumstances on
the mountains as well as along the coast it would at first seem
that we discover in that part of the globe a certain influence of
the heights on the dip of the needle and the intensity of the
magnetical forces but we must remark that the dip at caracas is
much greater than could be supposed from the situation of the
town and that the magnetical phenomena are modified by the
proximity of certain rocks which constitute so many particular
centres or little systems of attraction* (* i have seen fragments
of quartz traversed by parallel bands of magnetic iron carried
into the valley of caracas by the waters descending from the
galipano and the cerro de avila this banded magnetic iron-ore is
found also in the sierra nevada of merida between the two peaks of
the silla angular fragments of cellular quartz are found covered
with red oxide of iron they do not act on the needle this oxide
is of a cinnabar-red colour)

the temperature of the atmosphere varied on the summit of the silla
from eleven to fourteen degrees according as the weather was calm
or windy every one knows how difficult it is to verify on the
summit of a mountain the temperature which is to serve for the
barometric calculation the wind was east which would seem to
prove that the trade-winds extend in this latitude much higher than
fifteen hundred toises von buch had observed that at the peak of
teneriffe near the northern limit of the trade-winds there exists
generally at the elevation of one thousand nine hundred toises a
contrary current from the west the academy of sciences recommended
the men of science who accompanied the unfortunate la perouse to
employ small air-balloons for the purpose of ascertaining at sea
the extent of the trade-winds within the tropics such experiments
are very difficult small balloons do not in general reach the
height of the silla and the light clouds which are sometimes
perceived at an elevation of three or four thousand toises for
instance the fleecy clouds called by the french moutons remain
almost fixed or have such a slow motion that it is impossible to
judge of the direction of the wind

during the short space of time that the sky was serene at the
zenith i found the blue of the atmosphere sensibly deeper than on
the coasts it is probable that in the months of july and august
the difference between the colour of the sky on the coasts and on
the summit of the silla is still more considerable but the
meteorological phenomenon with which m bonpland and myself were
most struck during the hour we passed on the mountain was the
apparent dryness of the air which seemed to increase as the fog
augmented

this fog soon became so dense that it would have been imprudent to
remain longer on the edge of a precipice of seven or eight thousand
feet deep* (* in the direction of north-west the slopes appear
more accessible and i have been told of a path frequented by
smugglers which leads to caravalleda between the two peaks of the
silla from the eastern peak i took the bearings of the western
peak 64 degrees 40 minutes south-west and of the houses which i
was told belonged to caravalleda 55 degrees 20 minutes north-west
) we descended the eastern dome of the silla and gathered in our
descent a gramen which not only forms a new and very remarkable
genus but which to our great astonishment we found again some
time after on the summit of the volcano of pichincha at the
distance of four hundred leagues from the silla in the southern
hemisphere* (* aegopogon cenchroides) the lichen floridus so
common in the north of europe covered the branches of the befaria
and the gualtheria odorata descending even to the roots of these
shrubs examining the mosses which cover the rocks of gneiss in the
valley between the two peaks i was surprised at finding real
pebbles rounded fragments of quartz* (* fragments of brown
copper-ore were found mixed with these pebbles at an elevation of
1170 toises) it may be conceived that the valley of caracas was
once an inland lake before the rio guayra found an issue to the
east near caurimare at the foot of the hill of auyamas and before
the ravine of tipe opened on the west in the direction of gatia
and cabo blanco but how can we imagine that these waters could
ascend as high as the silla when the mountains opposite this peak
those of ocumare were too low to prevent their overflow into the
llanos? the pebbles could not have been brought by torrents from
more elevated points since there is no height that commands the
silla must we admit that they have been heaved up like all the
mountains which border the coast

it was half after four in the afternoon when we finished our
observations satisfied with the success of our journey we forgot
that there might be danger in descending in the dark steep
declivities covered by a smooth and slippery turf the mist
concealed the valley from us but we distinguished the double hill
of la puerta which like all objects lying almost perpendicularly
beneath the eye appeared extremely near we relinquished our
design of passing the night between the two summits of the silla
and having again found the path we had cut through the thick wood
of heliconia we soon arrived at the pejual the region of
odoriferous and resinous plants the beauty of the befarias and
their branches covered with large purple flowers again rivetted
our attention when in these climates a botanist gathers plants
to form his herbal he becomes difficult in his choice in
proportion to the luxuriance of vegetation he casts away those
which have been first cut because they appear less beautiful than
those which were out of reach though loaded with plants before
quitting the pejual we still regretted not having made a more
ample harvest we tarried so long in this spot that night
surprised us as we entered the savannah at the elevation of
upwards of nine hundred toises

as there is scarcely any twilight in the tropics we pass suddenly
from bright daylight to darkness the moon was on the horizon but
her disk was veiled from time to time by thick clouds drifted by a
cold and rough wind rapid slopes covered with yellow and dry
grass now seen in shade and now suddenly illumined seemed like
precipices the depth of which the eye sought in vain to measure
we proceeded onwards in single file and endeavoured to support
ourselves by our hands lest we should roll down the guides who
carried our instruments abandoned us successively to sleep on the
mountain among those who remained with us was a congo black who
evinced great address bearing on his head a large dipping-needle
he held it constantly steady notwithstanding the extreme declivity
of the rocks the fog had dispersed by degrees in the bottom of the
valley and the scattered lights we perceived below us caused a
double illusion the steeps appeared still more dangerous than they
really were and during six hours of continual descent we seemed
to be always equally near the farms at the foot of the silla we
heard very distinctly the voices of men and the notes of guitars
sound is generally so well propagated upwards that in a balloon at
the elevation of three thousand toises the barking of dogs is
sometimes heard* (* gay-lussac's account of his ascent on the 15th
of september 1805)

we did not arrive till ten at night at the bottom of the valley we
were overcome with fatigue and thirst having walked for fifteen
hours nearly without stopping the soles of our feet were cut and
torn by the asperities of a rocky soil and the hard and dry stalks
of the gramina for we had been obliged to pull off our boots the
soles having become too slippery on declivities devoid of shrubs
or ligneous herbs which may be grasped by the hand the danger of
the descent is diminished by walking barefoot in order to shorten
the way our guides conducted us from the puerta de la silla to the
farm of gallegos by a path leading to a reservoir of water called
el tanque they missed their way however and this last descent
the steepest of all brought us near the ravine of chacaito the
noise of the cascades gave this nocturnal scene a grand and wild
character

we passed the night at the foot of the silla our friends at
caracas had been able to distinguish us with glasses on the summit
of the eastern peak they felt interested in hearing the account of
our expedition but they were not satisfied with the result of our
measurement which did not assign to the silla even the elevation
of the highest summit of the pyrenees* (* it was formerly believed
that the height of the silla of caracas scarcely differed from that
of the peak of teneriffe) one cannot blame the national feeling
which suggests exaggerated ideas of the monuments of nature in a
country in which the monuments of art are nothing nor can we
wonder that the inhabitants of quito and riobamba who have prided
themselves for ages on the height of chimborazo mistrust those
measurements which elevate the mountains of himalaya above all the
colossal cordilleras?

during our journey to the silla and in all our excursions in the
valley of caracas we were very attentive to the lodes and
indications of ore which we found in the strata of gneiss no
regular diggings having been made we could only examine the
fissures the ravines and the land-slips occasioned by torrents in
the rainy season the rock of gneiss passing sometimes into a
granite of new formation sometimes into mica-slate* (* especially
at great elevations) belongs in germany to the most metalliferous
rocks but in the new continent the gneiss has not hitherto been
remarked as very rich in ores worth working the most celebrated
mines of mexico and peru are found in the primitive and transition
schists in the trap-porphyries the grauwakke and the alpine
limestones in several spots of the valley of caracas the gneiss
contains a small quantity of gold disseminated in small veins of
quartz sulphuretted silver azure copper-ore and galena but it
is doubtful whether these different metalliferous substances are
not too poor to encourage any attempt at working them such
attempts were however made at the conquest of the province about
the middle of the sixteenth century

from the promontory of paria to beyond cape vela the early
navigators had seen gold ornaments and gold dust in the possession
of the inhabitants of the coast they penetrated into the interior
of the country to discover whence the precious metal came and
though the information obtained in the province of coro and the
markets of curiana and cauchieto* (* the spaniards found in 1500
in the country of curiana (now coro) little birds frogs and
other ornaments made of gold those who had cast these figures
lived at cauchieto a place nearer the rio de la hacha i have seen
ornaments resembling those described by peter martyr of anghiera
(which indicate tolerable skill in goldsmiths' work) among the
remains of the ancient inhabitants of cundinamarca the same art
appears to have been practised in places along the coasts and also
farther to the south among the mountains of new grenada) clearly
proved that real mineral wealth was to be found only to the west
and south-west of coro (that is to say in the mountains near those
of new grenada) the whole province of caracas was nevertheless
eagerly explored a governor newly arrived on that coast could
recommend himself to the spanish court only by boasting of the
mines of his province and in order to take from cupidity what was
most ignoble and repulsive the thirst of gold was justified by the
purpose to which it was pretended the riches acquired by fraud and
violence might be employed "gold" says christopher columbus in
his last letter* (lettera rarissima data nelle indie nella isola di
jamaica a 7 julio dei 1503 "le oro e metallo sopra gli altri
excellentissimo e dell' oro si fanno li tesori e chi lo tiene fa e
opera quanto vuole nel mondo[?] e finel[?]mente aggionge a mandare
le anime al paradiso") to king ferdinand "gold is a thing so much
the more necessary to your majesty because in order to fulfil the
ancient prophecy jerusalem is to be rebuilt by a prince of the
spanish monarchy gold is the most excellent of metals what
becomes of those precious stones which are sought for at the
extremities of the globe? they are sold and are finally converted
into gold with gold we not only do whatever we please in this
world but we can even employ it to snatch souls from purgatory
and to people paradise" these words bear the stamp of the age in
which columbus lived but we are surprised to see this pompous
eulogium of riches written by a man whose whole life was marked by
the most noble disinterestedness

the conquest of the province of venezuela having been begun at its
western extremity the neighbouring mountains of coro tocuyo and
barquisimeto first attracted the attention of the conquistadores
these mountains join the cordilleras of new grenada (those of santa
fe pamplona la grita and merida) to the littoral chain of
caracas it is a land the more interesting in a geognostical point
of view as no map has yet made known the mountainous ramifications
which the paramos of niquitao and las rosas send out towards the
north-east between tocuyo araure and barquisimeto rises the
group of the altar mountains connected on the south-east with the
paramo of las rosas a branch of the altar stretches north-east by
san felipe el fuerte joining the granitic mountains of the coast
near porto cabello the other branch takes an eastward direction
towards nirgua and tinaco and joins the chain of the interior
that of yusma villa de cura and sabana de ocumare

the region we have been here describing separates the waters which
flow to the orinoco from those which run into the immense lake of
maracaybo and the caribbean sea it includes climates which may be
termed temperate rather than hot and it is looked upon in the
country notwithstanding the distance of more than a hundred
leagues as a prolongation of the metalliferous soil of pamplona
it was in the group of the western mountains of venezuela that the
spaniards in the year 1551 worked the gold mine of buria* (*
real de minas de san felipe de buria) which was the origin of the
foundation of the town of barquisimeto* (* nueva segovia) but
these works like many other mines successively opened were soon
abandoned here as in all the mountains of venezuela the produce
of the ore has been found to be very variable the lodes are very
often divided or they altogether cease and the metals appear only
in kidney-ores and present the most delusive appearances it is
however only in this group of mountains of san felipe and
barquisimeto that the working of mines has been continued till the
present time those of aroa near san felipe el fuerte situated in
the centre of a very insalubrious country are the only mines which
are wrought in the whole capitania-general of caracas they yield a
small quantity of copper

next to the works at buria near barquisimeto those of the valley
of caracas and of the mountains near the capital are the most
ancient francisco faxardo and his wife isabella of the nation of
the guaiquerias* often visited the table-land where the capital of
venezuela is now situated (* faxardo and his wife were the
founders of the town of the collado now called caravalleda) they
had given this table-land the name of valle de san francisco and
having seen some bits of gold in the hands of the natives faxardo
succeeded in the year 1560 in discovering the mines of los
teques* to the south-west of caracas near the group of the
mountains of cocuiza which separate the valleys of caracas and
aragua (* thirteen years later in 1573 gabriel de avila one of
the alcaldes of the new town of caracas renewed the working of
these mines which were from that time called the "real de minas de
nuestra senora" probably this same avila on account of a few
farms which he possessed in the mountains adjacent to la guayra and
caracas has occasioned the cumbre to receive the name of montana
de avila this name has subsequently been applied erroneously to
the silla and to all the chain which extends towards cape codera)
it is thought that in the first of these valleys near baruta
south of the village of valle the natives had made some
excavations in veins of auriferous quartz and that when the
spaniards first settled there and founded the town of caracas
they filled the shafts which had been dry with water it is now
impossible to ascertain this fact but it is certain that long
before the conquest grains of gold were a medium of exchange i do
not say generally but among certain nations of the new continent
they gave gold for the purchase of pearls and it does not appear
extraordinary that after having for a long time picked up grains
of gold in the rivulets people who had fixed habitations and were
devoted to agriculture should have tried to trace the auriferous
veins in the superior surface of the soil the mines of los teques
could not be peaceably wrought till the defeat of the cacique
guaycaypuro a celebrated chief of the teques who long contested
with the spaniards the possession of the province of venezuela

we have yet to mention a third point to which the attention of the
conquistadores was called by indications of mines so early as the
end of the sixteenth century in following the valley of caracas
eastward beyond caurimare on the road to caucagua we reach a
mountainous and woody country where a great quantity of charcoal
is now made and which anciently bore the name of the province of
los mariches in these eastern mountains of venezuela the gneiss
passes into the state of talc it contains as at salzburg lodes
of auriferous quartz the works anciently begun in those mines have
often been abandoned and resumed

the mines of caracas were forgotten during more than a hundred
years but at a period comparatively recent about the end of the
last century an intendant of venezuela don jose avalo again fell
into the illusions which had flattered the cupidity of the
conquistadores he fancied that all the mountains near the capital
contained great metallic riches some mexican miners were engaged
and their operations were directed to the ravine of tipe and the
ancient mines of baruta to the south of caracas where the indians
gather even now some little gold-washings but the zeal which had
prompted the enterprise soon diminished and after much useless
expense the working of the mines of caracas was totally abandoned
a small quantity of auriferous pyrites sulphuretted silver and a
little native gold were found but these were only feeble
indications and in a country where labour is extremely dear there
was no inducement to pursue works so little productive

we visited the ravine of tipe situated in that part of the valley
which opens in the direction of cabo blanco proceeding from
caracas we traverse in the direction of the great barracks of san
carlos a barren and rocky soil only a very few plants of argemone
mexicana are to be found the gneiss appears everywhere above
ground we might have fancied ourselves on the table-land of
freiberg we crossed first the little rivulet of agua salud a
limpid stream which has no mineral taste and then the rio
garaguata the road is commanded on the right by the cerro de avila
and the cumbre and on the left by the mountains of aguas negras
this defile is very interesting in a geological point of view at
this spot the valley of caracas communicates by the valleys of
tacagua and of tipe with the coast near catia a ridge of rock
the summit of which is forty toises above the bottom of the valley
of caracas and more than three hundred toises above the valley of
tacagua divides the waters which flow into the rio guayra and
towards cabo blanco on this point of division at the entrance of
the branch the view is highly pleasing the climate changes as we
descend westward in the valley of tacagua we found some new
habitations and also conucos of maize and plantains a very
extensive plantation of tuna or cactus stamps this barren country
with a peculiar character the cactuses reach the height of fifteen
feet and grow in the form of candelabra like the euphorbia of
africa they are cultivated for the purpose of selling their
refreshing fruits in the market of caracas the variety which has
no thorns is called strangely enough in the colonies tuna de
espana (spanish cactus) we measured at the same place magueys or
agaves the long stems of which laden with flowers were
forty-four feet high however common this plant is become in the
south of europe the native of a northern climate is never weary of
admiring the rapid development of a liliaceous plant which
contains at once a sweet juice and astringent and caustic liquids
employed to cauterize wounds

we found several veins of quartz in the valley of tipe visible
above the soil they contained pyrites carbonated iron-ore traces
of sulphuretted silver (glasserz) and grey copper-ore (fahlerz)
the works which had been undertaken either for extracting the ore
or exploring the nature of its bed appeared to be very
superficial the earth falling in had filled up those excavations
and we could not judge of the richness of the lode notwithstanding
the expense incurred under the intendancy of don jose avalo the
great question whether the province of venezuela contains mines
rich enough to be worked is yet problematical though in countries
where hands are wanting the culture of the soil demands
unquestionably the first care of the government yet the example of
new spain sufficiently proves that mining is not always
unfavourable to the progress of agriculture the best-cultivated
mexican lands those which remind the traveller of the most
beautiful districts of france and the south of germany extend from
silao towards the villa of leon they are in the neighbourhood of
the mines of guanaxuato which alone furnish a sixth part of all
the silver of the new world

earthquakes at caracas
connection of those phenomena with the volcanic eruptions
  of the west india islands

on the evening of the 7th of february we took our departure from
caracas since the period of our visit to that place tremendous
earthquakes have changed the surface of the soil the city which i
have described has disappeared and on the same spot on the
ground fissured in various directions another city is now slowly
rising the heaps of ruins which were the grave of a numerous
population are becoming anew the habitation of men in retracing
changes of so general an interest i shall be led to notice events
which took place long after my return to europe i shall pass over
in silence the popular commotions which have taken place and the
modifications which society has undergone modern nations careful
of their own remembrances snatch from oblivion the history of
human revolutions which is in fact the history of ardent
passions and inveterate hatred it is not the same with respect to
the revolutions of the physical world these are described with
least accuracy when they happen to be contemporary with civil
dissensions earthquakes and eruptions of volcanoes strike the
imagination by the evils which are their necessary consequence
tradition seizes on whatever is vague and marvellous and amid
great public calamities as in private misfortunes man seems to
shun that light which leads us to discover the real causes of
events and to understand the circumstances by which they are
attended

i have recorded in this work all i have been able to collect and
on the accuracy of which i can rely respecting the earthquake of
the 26th of march 1812 by that catastrophe the town of caracas
was destroyed and more than twenty thousand persons perished
throughout the extent of the province of venezuela the intercourse
which i have kept up with persons of all classes has enabled me to
compare the description given by many eye-witnesses and to
interrogate them on objects that may throw light on physical
science in general the traveller as the historian of nature
should verify the dates of great catastrophes examine their
connection and their mutual relations and should mark in the rapid
course of ages in the continual progress of successive changes
those fixed points with which other catastrophes may one day be
compared all epochs are proximate to each other in the immensity
of time comprehended in the history of nature years which have
passed away seem but a few instants and the physical descriptions
of a country even when they offer subjects of no very powerful and
general interest have at least the advantage of never becoming
old similar considerations no doubt led m de la condamine to
describe in his voyage a l'equateur the memorable eruptions of the
volcano of cotopaxi* which took place long after his departure
from quito (* those of the 30th of november 1744 and of the 3rd
of september 1750) i feel the less hesitation in following the
example of that celebrated traveller as the events i am about to
relate will help to elucidate the theory of volcanic reaction or
the influence of a system of volcanoes on a vast space of
circumjacent territory

at the time when m bonpland and myself visited the provinces of
new andalusia new barcelona and caracas it was generally
believed that the most eastern parts of those coasts were
especially exposed to the destructive effects of earthquakes the
inhabitants of cumana dreaded the valley of caracas on account of
its damp and variable climate and its gloomy and misty sky whilst
the inhabitants of the temperate valley regarded cumana as a town
whose inhabitants incessantly inhaled a burning atmosphere and
whose soil was periodically agitated by violent commotions
unmindful of the overthrow of riobamba and other very elevated
towns and not aware that the peninsula of araya composed of
mica-slate shares the commotions of the calcareous coast of
cumana well-informed persons imagined they discerned security in
the structure of the primitive rocks of caracas as well as in the
elevated situation of this valley religious ceremonies celebrated
at la guayra and even in the capital in the middle of the night*
doubtless called to mind the fact that the province of venezuela
had been subject at intervals to earthquakes but dangers of rare
occurrence are slightly feared (* for instance the nocturnal
procession of the 21st of october instituted in commemoration of
the great earthquake which took place on that day of the month at
one o'clock in the morning in 1778 other very violent shocks were
those of 1641 1703 and 1802) however in the year 1811 fatal
experience destroyed the illusion of theory and of popular opinion
caracas situated in the mountains three degrees west of cumana
and five degrees west of the volcanoes of the caribbee islands has
suffered greater shocks than were ever experienced on the coast of
paria or new andalusia

at my arrival in terra firma i was struck with the connection
between the destruction of cumana on the 14th of december 1797
and the eruption of the volcanoes in the smaller west india
islands this connection was again manifest in the destruction of
caracas on the 26th of march 1812 the volcano of guadaloupe
seemed in 1797 to have exercised a reaction on the coasts of
cumana fifteen years later it was a volcano situated nearer the
continent (that of st vincent) which appeared to have extended
its influence as far as caracas and the banks of apure possibly
at both those periods the centre of the explosion was at an
immense depth equally distant from the regions towards which the
motion was propagated at the surface of the globe

from the beginning of 1811 to 1813 a vast superficies of the
earth* (* between latitudes 5 and 36 degrees north and 31 and 91
degrees west longitude from paris) bound by the meridian of the
azores the valley of the ohio the cordilleras of new grenada the
coasts of venezuela and the volcanoes of the smaller west india
islands was shaken throughout its whole extent by commotions
which may be attributed to subterranean fires the following series
of phenomena seems to indicate communications at enormous
distances on the 30th of january 1811 a submarine volcano broke
out near the island of st michael one of the azores at a place
where the sea was sixty fathoms deep a rock made its appearance
above the surface of the waters the heaving-up of the softened
crust of the globe appears to have preceded the eruption of flame
at the crater as had already been observed at the volcanoes of
jorullo in mexico and on the appearance of the little island of
kameni near santorino the new islet of the azores was at first a
mere shoal but on the 15th of june an eruption which lasted six
days enlarged its extent and carried it progressively to the
height of fifty toises above the surface of the sea this new land
of which captain tillard took possession in the name of the british
government giving it the name of sabrina island was nine hundred
toises in diameter it has again it seems been swallowed up by
the ocean this is the third time that submarine volcanoes have
presented this extraordinary spectacle near the island of st
michael and as if the eruptions of these volcanoes were subject
to periodical recurrence owing to a certain accumulation of
elastic fluids the island raised up has appeared at intervals of
ninety-one or ninety-two years* (* malte-brun geographie
universelle there is however some doubt respecting the eruption
of 1628 to which some accounts assign the date of 1638 the rising
always happened near the island of st michael though not
identically on the same spot it is remarkable that the small
island of 1720 reached the same elevation as the island of sabrina
in 1811)

at the time of the appearance of the new island of sabrina the
smaller west india islands situated eight hundred leagues
south-west of the azores experienced frequent earthquakes more
than two hundred shocks were felt from the month of may 1811 to
april 1812 at st vincent one of the three islands in which there
are still active volcanoes the commotion was not circumscribed to
the insular portion of eastern america and from the 16th of
december 1811 till the year 1813 the earth was almost
incessantly agitated in the valleys of the mississippi the
arkansas river and the ohio the oscillations were more feeble on
the east of the alleghanies than to the west of these mountains
in tennessee and kentucky they were accompanied by a great
subterranean noise proceeding from the south-west in some places
between new madrid and little prairie as at the saline north of
cincinnati in latitude 37 degrees 45 minutes shocks were felt
every day nay almost every hour during several months the whole
of these phenomena continued from the 16th of december 1811 till
the year 1813 the commotion confined at first to the south in
the valley of the lower mississippi appeared to advance slowly
northward

precisely at the period when this long series of earthquakes
commenced in the transalleghanian states (in the month of december
1811) the town of caracas felt the first shock in calm and serene
weather this coincidence of phenomena was probably not accidental
for it must be borne in mind that notwithstanding the distance
which separates these countries the low grounds of louisiana and
the coasts of venezuela and cumana belong to the same basin that
of the gulf of mexico when we consider geologically the basin of
the caribbean sea and of the gulf of mexico we find it bounded on
the south by the coast-chain of venezuela and the cordilleras of
merida and pamplona on the east by the mountains of the west india
islands and the alleghanies on the west by the andes of mexico
and the rocky mountains and on the north by the very
inconsiderable elevations which separate the canadian lakes from
the rivers which flow into the mississippi more than two-thirds of
this basin are covered with water it is bordered by two ranges of
active volcanoes on the east in the carribee islands between
latitudes 13 and 16 degrees and on the west in the cordilleras of
nicaragua guatimala and mexico between latitudes 11 and 20
degrees when we reflect that the great earthquake at lisbon of
the 1st of november 1755 was felt almost simultaneously on the
coasts of sweden at lake ontario and at the island of martinique
it may not seem unreasonable to suppose that all this basin of the
west indies from cumana and caracas as far as the plains of
louisiana should be simultaneously agitated by commotions
proceeding from the same centre of action

it is an opinion very generally prevalent on the coasts of terra
firma that earthquakes become more frequent when electric
explosions have been during some years rare it is supposed to have
been observed at cumana and at caracas that the rains were less
frequently attended with thunder from the year 1792 and the total
destruction of cumana in 1797 as well as the commotions felt in
1800 1801 and 1802 at maracaibo porto cabello and caracas
have not failed to be attributed to an accumulation of electricity
in the interior of the earth persons who have lived long in new
andalusia or in the low regions of peru will admit that the
period most to be dreaded for the frequency of earthquakes is the
beginning of the rainy season which however is also the season
of thunder-storms the atmosphere and the state of the surface of
the globe seem to exercise an influence unknown to us on the
changes which take place at great depths and i am inclined to
think that the connection which it is supposed has been traced
between the absence of thunder-storms and the frequency of
earthquakes is rather a physical hypothesis framed by the
half-learned of the country than the result of long experience the
coincidence of certain phenomena may be favoured by chance the
extraordinary commotions felt almost continually during the space
of two years on the banks of the mississippi and the ohio and
which corresponded in 1812 with those of the valley of caracas
were preceded at louisiana by a year almost exempt from
thunder-storms the public mind was again struck with this
phenomenon we cannot be surprised that there should be in the
native land of franklin a great readiness to receive explanations
founded on the theory of electricity

the shock felt at caracas in the month of december 1811 was the
only one which preceded the terrible catastrophe of the 26th of
march 1812 the inhabitants of terra firma were alike ignorant of
the agitations of the volcano in the island of st vincent and of
those felt in the basin of the mississippi where on the 7th and
8th of february 1812 the earth was day and night in perpetual
oscillation a great drought prevailed at this period in the
province of venezuela not a single drop of rain had fallen at
caracas or in the country to the distance of ninety leagues round
during five months preceding the destruction of the capital the
26th of march was a remarkably hot day the air was calm and the
sky unclouded it was ascension-day and a great portion of the
population was assembled in the churches nothing seemed to presage
the calamities of the day at seven minutes after four in the
afternoon the first shock was felt it was sufficiently forcible to
make the bells of the churches toll and it lasted five or six
seconds during that interval the ground was in a continual
undulating movement and seemed to heave up like a boiling liquid
the danger was thought to be past when a tremendous subterranean
noise was heard resembling the rolling of thunder but louder and
of longer continuance than that heard within the tropics in the
time of storms this noise preceded a perpendicular motion of three
or four seconds followed by an undulatory movement somewhat
longer the shocks were in opposite directions proceeding from
north to south and from east to west nothing could resist the
perpendicular movement and the transverse undulations the town of
caracas was entirely overthrown and between nine and ten thousand
of the inhabitants were buried under the ruins of the houses and
churches the procession of ascension-day had not yet begun to pass
through the streets but the crowd was so great within the churches
that nearly three or four thousand persons were crushed by the fall
of the roofs the explosion was most violent towards the north in
that part of the town situated nearest the mountain of avila and
the silla the churches of la trinidad and alta gracia which were
more than one hundred and fifty feet high and the naves of which
were supported by pillars of twelve or fifteen feet diameter were
reduced to a mass of ruins scarcely exceeding five or six feet in
elevation the sinking of the ruins has been so considerable that
there now scarcely remain any vestiges of pillars or columns the
barracks called el quartel de san carlos situated north of the
church of la trinidad on the road from the custom-house of la
pastora almost entirely disappeared a regiment of troops of the
line under arms and in readiness to join the procession was
with the exception of a few men buried beneath the ruins of the
barracks nine-tenths of the fine city of caracas were entirely
destroyed the walls of some houses not thrown down as those in
the street san juan near the capuchin hospital were cracked in
such a manner as to render them uninhabitable the effects of the
earthquake were somewhat less violent in the western and southern
parts of the city between the principal square and the ravine of
caraguata there the cathedral supported by enormous buttresses
remains standing

it is computed that nine or ten thousand persons were killed in the
city of caracas exclusive of those who being dangerously wounded
perished several months after for want of food and proper care
the night of the festival of the ascension witnessed an awful scene
of desolation and distress the thick cloud of dust which rising
above the ruins darkened the sky like a fog had settled on the
ground no commotion was felt and never was a night more calm or
more serene the moon then nearly at the full illumined the
rounded domes of the silla and the aspect of the sky formed a
perfect contrast to that of the earth which was covered with the
bodies of the dead and heaped with ruins mothers were seen
bearing in their arms their children whom they hoped to recall to
life desolate families were wandering through the city seeking a
brother a husband or a friend of whose fate they were ignorant
and whom they believed to be lost in the crowd the people pressed
along the streets which could be traced only by long lines of
ruins

all the calamities experienced in the great catastrophes of lisbon
messina lima and riobamba were renewed at caracas on the fatal
26th of march 1812 wounded persons buried beneath the ruins
were heard imploring by their cries the help of the passers-by and
nearly two thousand were dug out never was pity more tenderly
evinced never was it more ingeniously active than in the efforts
employed to save the miserable victims whose groans reached the
ear implements for digging and clearing away the ruins were
entirely wanting and the people were obliged to use their bare
hands to disinter the living the wounded as well as the invalids
who had escaped from the hospitals were laid on the banks of the
small river guayra where there was no shelter but the foliage of
trees beds linen to dress the wounds instruments of surgery
medicines every object of the most urgent necessity was buried in
the ruins everything even food was wanting and for the space of
several days water became scarce in the interior of the city the
commotion had rent the pipes of the fountains and the falling in
of the earth had choked up the springs that supplied them to
procure water it was necessary to go down to the river guayra
which was considerably swelled and even when the water was
obtained vessels for conveying it were wanting

there was a duty to be fulfilled to the dead enjoined at once by
piety and the dread of infection it being impossible to inter so
many thousand bodies half-buried under the ruins commissioners
were appointed to burn them and for this purpose funeral piles
were erected between the heaps of ruins this ceremony lasted
several days amidst so many public calamities the people devoted
themselves to those religious duties which they thought best fitted
to appease the wrath of heaven some assembling in processions
sang funeral hymns others in a state of distraction made their
confessions aloud in the streets in caracas was then repeated what
had been remarked in the province of quito after the tremendous
earthquake of 1797 a number of marriages were contracted between
persons who had neglected for many years to sanction their union by
the sacerdotal benediction children found parents by whom they
had never till then been acknowledged restitutions were promised
by persons who had never been accused of fraud and families who
had long been at enmity were drawn together by the tie of common
calamity but if this feeling seemed to calm the passions of some
and open the heart to pity it had a contrary effect on others
rendering them more rigorous and inhuman in great calamities
vulgar minds evince less of goodness than of energy misfortune
acts in the same manner as the pursuits of literature and the study
of nature the happy influence of which is felt only by a few
giving more ardour to sentiment more elevation to the thoughts
and increased benevolence to the disposition

shocks as violent as those which in about the space of a minute*
overthrew the city of caracas could not be confined to a small
portion of the continent (* the duration of the earthquake that
is to say the whole of the movements of undulation and rising
(undulacion y trepidacion) which occasioned the horrible
catastrophe of the 26th of march 1812 was estimated by some at 50
seconds by others at 1 minute 12 seconds) their fatal effects
extended as far as the provinces of venezuela varinas and
maracaibo along the coast and especially to the inland mountains
la guayra mayquetia antimano baruta la vega san felipe and
merida were almost entirely destroyed the number of the dead
exceeded four or five thousand at la guayra and at the town of san
felipe near the copper-mines of aroa it would appear that on a
line running east-north-east and west-south-west from la guayra and
caracas to the lofty mountains of niquitao and merida the violence
of the earthquake was principally directed it was felt in the
kingdom of new grenada from the branches of the high sierra de
santa martha* (* as far as villa de los remedios and even to
carthagena) as far as santa fe de bogota and honda on the banks
of the magdalena one hundred and eighty leagues from caracas it
was everywhere more violent in the cordilleras of gneiss and
mica-slate or immediately at their base than in the plains and
this difference was particularly striking in the savannahs of
varinas and casanara* (* this is easily explained according to the
system of those geologists who are of opinion that all chains of
mountains volcanic and not volcanic have been formed by being
raised up as if through crevices) in the valleys of aragua
between caracas and the town of san felipe the commotions were
very slight and la victoria maracay and valencia scarcely
suffered at all notwithstanding their proximity to the capital at
valecillo a few leagues from valencia the yawning earth threw out
such an immense quantity of water that it formed a new torrent
the same phenomenon took place near porto-cabello* (* it is
asserted that in the mountains of aroa the ground immediately
after the great shocks was found covered with a very fine and
white earth which appeared to have been projected through
crevices) on the other hand the lake of maracaybo diminished
sensibly at coro no commotion was felt though the town is
situated on the coast between other towns which suffered from the
earthquake fishermen who had passed the day of the 26th of march
in the island of orchila thirty leagues north-east of la guayra
felt no shock these differences in the direction and propagation
of the shock are probably owing to the peculiar position of the
stony strata

having thus traced the effects of the earthquake to the west of
caracas as far as the snowy mountains of santa martha and the
table-land of santa fe de bogota we will proceed to consider their
action on the country eastward of the capital the commotions were
very violent beyond caurimare in the valley of capaya where they
extended as far as the meridian of cape codera but it is extremely
remarkable that they were very feeble on the coasts of nueva
barcelona cumana and paria though these coasts are the
continuation of the shore of la guayra and were formerly known to
have been often agitated by subterranean commotions admitting that
the destruction of the four towns of caracas la guayra san
felipe and merida may be attributed to a volcanic focus situated
under or near the island of st vincent we may conceive that the
motion might have been propagated from north-east to south-west in
a line passing through the islands of los hermanos near
blanquilla without touching the coasts of araya cumana and nueva
barcelona this propagation of the shock might even have taken
place without any commotion having been felt at the intermediate
points on the surface of the globe (the hermanos islands for
instance) this phenomenon is frequently remarked at peru and
mexico in earthquakes which have followed during ages a fixed
direction the inhabitants of the andes say speaking of an
intermediary tract of ground not affected by the general
commotion "that it forms a bridge" (que hace puente) as if they
mean to indicate by this expression that the undulations are
propagated at an immense depth under an inert rock

at caracas fifteen or eighteen hours after the great catastrophe
the earth was tranquil the night as has already been observed
was fine and calm and the commotions did not recommence till after
the 27th they were then attended by a very loud and long continued
subterranean noise (bramido) the inhabitants of the destroyed city
wandered into the country but the villages and farms having
suffered as much as the town they could find no shelter till they
were beyond the mountains of los teques in the valleys of aragua
and in the llanos or savannahs no less than fifteen oscillations
were felt in one day on the 5th of april there was almost as
violent an earthquake as that which overthrew the capital during
several hours the ground was in a state of perpetual undulation
large heaps of earth fell in the mountains and enormous masses of
rock were detached from the silla of caracas it was even asserted
and this opinion prevails still in the country that the two domes
of the silla sunk fifty or sixty toises but this statement is not
founded on any measurement i am informed that in like manner in
the province of quito the people at every period of great
commotions imagine that the volcano of tunguragua diminishes in
height it has been affirmed in many published accounts of the
destruction of caracas that the mountain of the silla is an
extinguished volcano that a great quantity of volcanic substances
are found on the road from la guayra to caracas that the rocks do
not present any regular stratification and that everything bears
the stamp of the action of fire it has even been stated that
twelve years prior to the great catastrophe m bonpland and myself
had from our own observations considered the silla as a very
dangerous neighbour to the city of caracas because the mountain
contained a great quantity of sulphur and the commotions must come
from the north-east it is seldom that observers of nature have to
justify themselves for an accomplished prediction but i think it
my duty to oppose ideas which are too easily adopted on the local
causes of earthquakes

in all places where the soil has been incessantly agitated for
whole months as at jamaica in 1693 lisbon in 1755 cumana in
1766 and piedmont in 1808 a volcano is expected to open people
forget that we must seek the focus or centre of action far from
the surface of the earth that according to undeniable evidence
the undulations are propagated almost at the same instant across
seas of immense depth at the distance of a thousand leagues and
that the greatest commotions take place not at the foot of active
volcanoes but in chains of mountains composed of the most
heterogeneous rocks in our geognostical observation of the country
round caracas we found gneiss and mica-slate containing beds of
primitive limestone the strata are scarcely more fractured or
irregularly inclined than near freyburg in saxony or wherever
mountains of primitive formation rise abruptly to great heights i
found at caracas neither basalt nor dorolite nor even trachytes or
trap-porphyries nor in general any trace of an extinguished
volcano unless we choose to regard the diabases of primitive
grunstein contained in gneiss as masses of lava which have
filled up fissures these diabases are the same as those of
bohemia saxony and franconia* (* these grunsteins are found in
bohemia near pilsen in granite in saxony in the mica-slates of
scheenberg in franconia between steeben and lauenstein in
transition-slates) and whatever opinion may be entertained
respecting the ancient causes of the oxidation of the globe at its
surface all those primitive mountains which contain a mixture of
hornblende and feldspar either in veins or in balls with
concentric layers will not i presume be called volcanic
formations mont blanc and mont d'or will not be ranged in one and
the same class even the partisans of the huttonian or volcanic
theory make a distinction between the lavas melted under the mere
pressure of the atmosphere at the surface of the globe and those
layers formed by fire beneath the immense weight of the ocean and
superincumbent rocks they would not confound auvergne and the
granitic valley of caracas in the same denomination that of a
country of extinct volcanoes

i never could have pronounced the opinion that the silla and the
cerro de avila mountains of gneiss and mica-slate were in
dangerous proximity to the city of caracas because they contained a
great quantity of pyrites in subordinate beds of primitive
limestone but i remember having said during my stay at caracas
that the eastern extremity of terra firma appeared since the great
earthquake of quito in a state of agitation which warranted
apprehension that the province of venezuela would gradually be
exposed to violent commotions i added that when a country had
been long subject to frequent shocks new subterranean
communications seemed to open with neighbouring countries and that
the volcanoes of the west india islands lying in the direction of
the silla north-east of the city were perhaps the vents at the
time of an eruption for those elastic fluids which cause
earthquakes on the coasts of the continent these considerations
founded on local knowledge of the place and on simple analogies
are very far from a prediction justified by the course of physical
events

on the 30th of april 1812 whilst violent commotions were felt
simultaneously in the valley of the mississippi in the island of
st vincent and in the province of venezuela a subterranean noise
resembling frequent discharges of large cannon was heard at
caracas at calabozo (situated in the midst of the steppes) and on
the borders of the rio apure over a superficies of four thousand
square leagues this noise began at two in the morning it was
accompanied by no shock and it is very remarkable that it was as
loud on the coast as at the distance of eighty leagues inland it
was everywhere believed to be transmitted through the air and was
so far from being thought a subterranean noise that in several
places preparations were made for defence against an enemy who
seemed to be advancing with heavy artillery senor palacio
crossing the rio apure below the orivante near the junction of the
rio nula was told by the inhabitants that the firing of cannon
had been heard distinctly at the western extremity of the province
of varinas as well as at the port of la guayra to the north of the
chain of the coast

the day on which the inhabitants of terra firma were alarmed by a
subterranean noise was that of the great eruption of the volcano in
the island of st vincent that mountain near five hundred toises
high had not thrown out lava since the year 1718 scarcely was any
smoke perceived to issue from it when in the month of may 1811
frequent shocks announced that the volcanic fire was either
rekindled or directed anew to that part of the west indies the
first eruption did not take place till the 27th of april 1812 at
noon it was merely an ejection of ashes but attended with a
tremendous noise on the 30th the lava overflowed the brink of the
crater and after a course of four hours reached the sea the
sound of the explosion is described as resembling that of alternate
discharges of very large cannon and musketry and it is worthy of
remark that it seemed much louder to persons out at sea and at a
great distance from land than to those within sight of land and
near the burning volcano

the distance in a straight line from the volcano of st vincent to
the rio apure near the mouth of the nula is two hundred and ten
leagues* (* where the contrary is not expressly stated nautical
leagues of twenty to a degree or two thousand eight hundred and
fifty-five toises are always to be understood) the explosions
were consequently heard at a distance equal to that between
vesuvius and paris this phenomenon in conjunction with a great
number of facts observed in the cordilleras of the andes shows
that the sphere of the subterranean activity of a volcano is much
more extensive than we should be disposed to admit if we judged
merely from the small changes effected at the surface of the globe
the detonations heard during whole days together in the new world
eighty one hundred or even two hundred leagues distant from a
crater do not reach us by the propagation of the sound through the
air they are transmitted by the earth perhaps in the very place
where we happen to be if the eruptions of the volcano of st
vincent cotopaxi or tunguragua resounded from afar like a
cannon of immense magnitude the noise ought to increase in the
inverse ratio of the distance but observations prove that this
augmentation does not take place i must further observe that m
bonpland and i going from guayaquil to the coast of mexico
crossed latitudes in the pacific where the crew of our ship were
dismayed by a hollow sound coming from the depth of the ocean and
transmitted by the waters at that time a new eruption of cotopaxi
took place but we were as far distant from the volcano as etna
from the city of naples the little town of honda on the banks of
the magdalena is not less than one hundred and forty-five leagues*
(* this is the distance from vesuvius to mont blanc) from
cotopaxi and yet in the great explosions of this volcano in
1744 a subterranean noise was heard at honda and supposed to be
discharges of heavy artillery the monks of san francisco spread a
report that the town of carthagena was besieged and bombarded by
the english and the intelligence was believed throughout the
country now the volcano of cotopaxi is a cone more than one
thousand eight hundred toises above the basin of honda and it
rises from a table-land the elevation of which is more than one
thousand five hundred toises above the valley of the magdalena in
all the colossal mountains of quito of the province of los pastos
and of popayan crevices and valleys without number intervene it
cannot be admitted under these circumstances that the noise was
transmitted through the air or over the surface of the globe and
that it came from the point at which the cone and crater of
cotapaxi are situated it appears probable that the more elevated
part of the kingdom of quito and the neighbouring cordilleras far
from being a group of distinct volcanoes constitute a single
swollen mass an enormous volcanic wall stretching from south to
north and the crest of which presents a superficies of more than
six hundred square leagues cotopaxi tunguragua antisana and
pichincha are on this same raised ground they have different
names but they are merely separate summits of the same volcanic
mass the fire issues sometimes from one sometimes from another of
these summits the obstructed craters appear to be extinguished
volcanoes but we may presume that while cotopaxi or tunguragua
have only one or two eruptions in the course of a century the fire
is not less continually active under the town of quito under
pichincha and imbabura

advancing northward we find between the volcano of cotopaxi and
the town of honda two other systems of volcanic mountains those
of los pastos and of popayan the connection between these systems
was manifested in the andes by a phenomenon which i have already
had occasion to notice in speaking of the last destruction of
cumana in the month of november 1796 a thick column of smoke began
to issue from the volcano of pasto west of the town of that name
and near the valley of rio guaytara the mouths of the volcano are
lateral and situated on its western declivity yet during three
successive months the column of smoke rose so much higher than the
ridge of the mountain that it was constantly visible to the
inhabitants of the town of pasto they described to us their
astonishment when on the 4th of february 1797 they observed the
smoke disappear in an instant whilst no shock whatever was felt
at that very moment sixty-five leagues southward between
chimborazo tunguragua and the altar (capac-urcu) the town of
riobamba was overthrown by the most terrible earthquake on record
is it possible to doubt from this coincidence of phenomena that
the vapours issuing from the small apertures or ventanillas of the
volcano of pasto had an influence on the pressure of those elastic
fluids which convulsed the earth in the kingdom of quito and
destroyed in a few minutes thirty or forty thousand inhabitants?

to explain these great effects of volcanic reactions and to prove
that the group or system of the volcanoes of the west india islands
may sometimes shake the continent i have cited the cordillera of
the andes geological reasoning can be supported only by the
analogy of facts which are recent and consequently well
authenticated and in what other region of the globe could we find
greater and more varied volcanic phenomena than in that double
chain of mountains heaved up by fire? in that land where nature has
covered every mountain and every valley with her marvels? if we
consider a burning crater only as an isolated phenomenon if we be
satisfied with merely examining the mass of stony substances which
it has thrown up the volcanic action at the surface of the globe
will appear neither very powerful nor very extensive but the image
of this action becomes enlarged in the mind when we study the
relations which link together volcanoes of the same group for
instance those of naples and sicily of the canary islands* of
the azores of the caribbee islands of mexico of guatimala and of
the table-land of quito when we examine either the reactions of
these different systems of volcanoes on one another or the
distance at which by subterranean communication they
simultaneously convulse the earth (i have already observed
(chapter 12) that the whole group of the canary islands rises as
we may say above one and the same submarine volcano since the
sixteenth century the fire of this volcano has burst forth
alternately in palma teneriffe and lancerote auvergne presents a
whole system of volcanoes the action of which has now ceased but
in the middle of a system of active volcanoes for instance in
that of quito we must not consider as an extinguished volcano a
mountain the crater of which is obstructed and through which the
subterraneous fire has not issued for ages etna the aeolian
isles vesuvius and epomeo the peak of teyde palma and
lancerote st michael la caldiera of fayal and pico st
vincent st lucia and guadaloupe orizava popocatepetl jorullo
and la colima bombacho the volcano of grenada telica momotombo
isalco and the volcano of guatimala cotopaxi tunguragua
pichincha antisana and sangai belong to the same system of
burning volcanoes they are generally ranged in rows as if they
had issued from a crevice or vein not filled up and it is very
remarkable that their position is in some parts in the general
direction of the cordilleras and in others in a contrary
direction)

the study of volcanoes may be divided into two distinct branches
one simply mineralogical is directed to the examination of the
stony strata altered or produced by the action of fire from the
formation of the trachytes or trap-porphyries of basalts
phonolites and dolerites to the most recent lavas the other
branch less accessible and more neglected comprehends the
physical relations which link volcanoes together the influence of
one volcanic system on another the connection existing between the
action of burning mountains and the commotions which agitate the
earth at great distances and during long intervals in the same
direction this study cannot progress till the various epochs of
simultaneous action the direction the extent and the force of
the convulsions are carefully noted till we have attentively
observed their progressive advance to regions which they had not
previously reached and the coincidence between distant volcanic
eruptions and those noises which the inhabitants of the andes very
expressively term subterraneous thunders or roarings* (* bramidos
y truenos subterraneos) all these objects are comprehended in the
domain of the history of nature

though the narrow circle within which all certain traditions are
confined does not present any of those general revolutions which
have heaved up the cordilleras and buried myriads of pelagian
animals yet nature acting under our eyes nevertheless exhibits
violent though partial changes the study of which may throw light
on the most remote epochs in the interior of the earth those
mysterious powers exist the effects of which are manifested at the
surface by the production of vapours of incandescent scoriae of
new volcanic rocks and thermal springs by the appearance of new
islands and mountains by commotions propagated with the rapidity
of an electric shock finally by those subterranean thunders*
heard during whole months without shaking the earth in regions
far distant from active volcanoes (* in the town of guanaxuato in
mexico these thunders lasted from the 9th of january till the 12th
of february 1784 guanaxuato is situated forty leagues north of
the volcano of jorullo and sixty leagues north west of the volcano
of popocatepetl in places nearer these two volcanoes three
leagues distant from guanaxuato the subterranean thunders were not
heard the noise was circumscribed within a very narrow space in
the region of a primitive schist which approaches a
transition-schist containing the richest silver mines of the known
world and on which rest trap-porphyries slates and diabasis
(grunstein))

in proportion as equinoctial america shall increase in culture and
population and the system of volcanoes of the central table-land
of mexico of the caribbee islands of popayan of los pastos and
quito shall be more attentively observed the connection of
eruptions and of earthquakes which precede and sometimes accompany
those eruptions will be more generally recognized the volcanoes
just mentioned particularly those of the andes which rise above
the enormous height of two thousand five hundred toises present
great advantages for observation the periods of their eruptions
are singularly regular they remain thirty or forty years without
emitting scoriae ashes or even vapours i could not perceive the
smallest trace of smoke on the summit of tunguragua or cotopaxi a
gust of vapour issuing from the crater of mount vesuvius scarcely
attracts the attention of the inhabitants of naples accustomed to
the movements of that little volcano which throws out scoriae
sometimes during two or three years successively thence it becomes
difficult to judge whether the emission of scoriae may have been
more frequent at the time when an earthquake has been felt in the
apennines on the ridge of the cordilleras everything assumes a
more decided character an eruption of ashes which lasts only a
few minutes is often followed by a calm of ten years in such
circumstances it is easy to mark the periods and to observe the
coincidence of phenomena

if as there appears to be little reason to doubt that the
destruction of cumana in 1797 and of caracas in 1812 indicate the
influence of the volcanoes of the west india islands* on the
commotions felt on the coasts of terra firma it may be desirable
before we close this chapter to take a cursory view of this
mediterranean archipelago

(* the following is the series of the phenomena

the volcanic islands form one-fifth of that great arc extending
from the coast of paria to the peninsula of florida running from
south to north they close the caribbean sea on the eastern side
while the greater west india islands appear like the remains of a
group of primitive mountains the summit of which seems to have
been between cape abacou point morant and the copper mountains
in that part where the islands of st domingo cuba and jamaica
are nearest to each other considering the basin of the atlantic as
an immense valley* which separates the two continents and where
from 20 degrees south to 30 degrees north the salient angles
(brazil and senegambia) correspond to the receding angles (the gulf
of guinea and the caribbean sea) we are led to think that the
latter sea owes its formation to the action of currents which
like the current of rotation now existing have flowed from east to
west and have given the southern coast of porto rico st domingo
and the island of cuba their uniform configuration (* the valley
is narrowest (300 leagues) between cape st roque and sierra leone
proceeding toward the north along the coasts of the new continent
from its pyramidal extremity or the straits of magellan we
imagine we recognise the effects of a repulsion directed first
toward the north-east then toward the north-west and finally
again to the north-east) this supposition of an oceanic irruption
has been the source of two other hypotheses on the origin of the
smaller west india islands some geologists admit that the
uninterrupted chain of islands from trinidad to florida exhibits
the remains of an ancient chain of mountains they connect this
chain sometimes with the granite of french guiana sometimes with
the calcareous mountains of pari others struck with the
difference of geological constitution between the primitive
mountains of the greater and the volcanic cones of the lesser
antilles consider the latter as having risen from the bottom of
the sea

if we recollect that volcanic upheavings when they take place
through elongated crevices usually take a straight direction we
shall find it difficult to judge from the disposition of the
craters alone whether the volcanoes have belonged to the same
chain or have always been isolated supposing an irruption of the
ocean to take place either into the eastern part of the island of
java* (* raffles history of java 1817 pages 23-28 the principal
line of the volcanoes of java on a distance of 160 leagues runs
from west to east through the mountains of gagak gede
tankuban-prahu ungarang merapi lawu wilis arjuna dasar and
tashem) or into the cordilleras of guatimala and nicaragua where
so many burning mountains form but one chain that chain would be
divided into several islands and would perfectly resemble the
caribbean archipelago the union of primitive formations and
volcanic rocks in the same range of mountain is not extraordinary
it is very distinctly seen in my geological sections of the
cordillera of the andes the trachytes and basalts of popayan are
separated from the system of the volcanoes of quito by the
mica-slates of almaguer the volcanoes of quito from the trachytes
of assuay by the gneiss of condorasta and guasunto there does not
exist a real chain of mountains running south-east and north-west
from oyapoc to the mouths of the orinoco and of which the smaller
west india islands might be a northern prolongation the granites
of guiana as well as the hornblende-slates which i saw near
angostura on the banks of the lower orinoco belong to the
mountains of pacaraimo and of parime stretching from west to east
* (from the cataracts of atures towards the essequibo river this
chain of pacaraimo divides the waters of the carony from those of
the rio parime or rio de aguas blancas) in the interior of the
continent and not in a direction parallel with the coast between
the mouths of the river amazon and the orinoco but though we find
no chain of mountains at the north-east extremity of terra firma
having the same direction as the archipelago of the smaller west
india islands it does not therefore follow that the volcanic
mountains of the archipelago may not have belonged originally to
the continent and formed a part of the littoral chain of caracas
and cumana* (* among many such examples which the structure of the
globe displays we shall mention only the inflexion at a right
angle formed by the higher alps towards the maritime alps in
europe and the belour-tagh which joins transversely the mouz-tagh
and the himalaya in asia amid the prejudices which impede the
progress of mineralogical geography we may reckon 1st the
supposition of a perfect uniformity of direction in the chains of
mountains 2nd the hypothesis of the continuity of all chains
3rd the supposition that the highest summits determine the
direction of a central chain 4th the idea that in all places
where great rivers take rise we may suppose the existence of great
tablelands or very high mountains)

in opposing the objections of some celebrated naturalists i am far
from maintaining the ancient contiguity of all the smaller west
india islands i am rather inclined to consider them as islands
heaved up by fire and ranged in that regular line of which we
find striking examples in so many volcanic hills in auvergne in
mexico and in peru the geological constitution of the archipelago
appears from the little we know respecting it to be very similar
to that of the azores and the canary islands primitive formations
are nowhere seen above ground we find only what belongs
unquestionably to volcanoes feldspar-lava dolerite basalt
conglomerated scoriae tufa and pumice-stone among the limestone
formations we must distinguish those which are essentially
subordinate to volcanic tufas* from those which appear to be the
work of madrepores and other zoophytes (* we have noticed some of
the above following von buch at lancerote and at fortaventura
in the system of the canary islands among the smaller islands of
the west indies the following islets are entirely calcareous
according to m cortes mariegalante la desirade the grande terre
of guadaloupe and the grenadillas according to the observations
of that naturalist curacoa and buenos ayres present only
calcareous formations m cortes divides the west india islands
into 1st those containing at once primitive secondary and
volcanic formations like the greater islands 2nd those entirely
calcareous (or at least so considered) as mariegalante and
curacoa 3rd those at once volcanic and calcareous as antigua
st bartholomew st martin and st thomas 4th those which have
volcanic rocks only as st vincent st lucia and st eustache)
the latter according to m moreau de jonnes seem to lie on shoals
of a volcanic nature those mountains which present traces of the
action of fire more or less recent and some of which reach nearly
nine hundred toises of elevation are all situated on the western
skirt of the smaller west india islands* (* journal des mines

system of the volcanoes of the smaller west india islands i will
here trace the direction of the islands from south to north grenada

extinguished volcanoes vauclin the paps of carbet which are
perhaps the most elevated summits of the smaller islands and

toises according to leblond it is 670 toises according to
dupuget 736 toises between vauclin and the feldspar-lavas of the

surrounded by pumice-stone (trinidad which is traversed by a
chain of primitive slate appears to have anciently formed a part
of the littoral chain of cumana and not of the system of the
mountains of the caribbee islands)) each island is not the effect
of one single heaving-up most of them appear to consist of
isolated masses which have been progressively united together the
matter has not been emitted from one crater but from several so
that a single island of small extent contains a whole system of
volcanoes regions purely basaltic and others covered with recent
lavas the volcanoes still burning are those of st vincent st
lucia and guadaloupe the first threw out lava in 1718 and 1812
in the second there is a continual formation of sulphur by the
condensation of vapours which issue from the crevices of an
ancient crater the last eruption of the volcano of guadaloupe took
place in 1797 the solfatara of st christopher's was still burning
in 1692 at martinique vauclin montagne pelee and the crater
surrounded by the five paps of carbet must be considered as three
extinguished volcanoes the effects of thunder have been often
confounded in that place with subterranean fire no good
observation has confirmed the supposed eruption of the 22nd of
january 1792 the group of volcanoes in the caribbee islands
resembles that of the volcanoes of quito and los pastos craters
with which the subterranean fire does not appear to communicate are
ranged on the same line with burning craters and alternate with
them

notwithstanding the intimate connection manifested in the action of
the volcanoes of the smaller west india islands and the earthquakes
of terra firma it often happens that shocks felt in the volcanic
archipelago are not propagated to the island of trinidad or to the
coasts of caracas and cumana this phenomenon is in no way
surprising even in the caribbees the commotions are often confined
to one place the great eruption of the volcano in st vincent's
did not occasion an earthquake at martinique or guadaloupe loud
explosions were heard there as well as at venezuela but the ground
was not convulsed

these explosions must not be confounded with the rolling noise
which everywhere precedes the slightest commotions they are often
heard on the banks of the orinoco and (as we were assured by
persons living on the spot) between the rio arauca and cuchivero
father morello relates that at the mission of cabruta the
subterranean noise so much resembles discharges of small cannon
(pedreros) that it has seemed as if a battle were being fought at a
distance on the 21st of october 1766 the day of the terrible
earthquake which desolated the province of new andalusia the
ground was simultaneously shaken at cumana at caracas at
maracaybo and on the banks of the casanare the meta the orinoco
and the ventuario father gili has described these commotions at
the mission of encaramada a country entirely granitic where they
were accompanied by loud explosions great fallings-in of the earth
took place in the mountain paurari and near the rock aravacoto a
small island disappeared in the orinoco the undulatory motion
continued during a whole hour this seemed the first signal of
those violent commotions which shook the coasts of cumana and
cariaco for more than ten months it might be supposed that men
living in woods with no other shelter than huts of reeds and
palm-leaves could have little to dread from earthquakes but at
erevato and caura where these phenomena are of rare occurrence
they terrify the indians frighten the beasts of the forests and
impel the crocodiles to quit the waters for the shore nearer the
sea where shocks are frequent far from being dreaded by the
inhabitants they are regarded with satisfaction as the prognostics
of a wet and fertile year

in this dissertation on the earthquakes of terra firma and on the
volcanoes of the neighbouring archipelago of the west india
islands i have pursued the plan of first relating a number of
particular facts and then considering them in one general point of
view everything announces in the interior of the globe the
operation of active powers which by mutual reaction balance and
modify one another the greater our ignorance of the causes of
these undulatory movements these evolutions of heat these
formations of elastic fluids the more it becomes the duty of
persons who apply themselves to the study of physical science to
examine the relations which these phenomena so uniformly present at
great distances apart it is only by considering these various
relations under a general point of view and tracing them over a
great extent of the surface of the globe through formations of
rocks the most different that we are led to abandon the
supposition of trifling local causes strata of pyrites or of
ignited coal* (* see "views of nature" on the structure and
action of volcanoes in different parts of the world page 353
(bohn's edition) also "cosmos" pages 199-225 (bohn's edition))

the following is the series of phenomena remarked on the northern
coasts of cumana nueva barcelona and caracas and presumed to be
connected with the causes which produce earthquakes and eruptions
of lava we shall begin with the most eastern extremity the island
of trinidad which seems rather to belong to the shore of the
continent than to the system of the mountains of the west india
islands

1 the pit which throws up asphaltum in the bay of mayaro on the
eastern coast of the island of trinidad southward of point
guataro this is the mine of chapapote or mineral tar of the
country i was assured that in the months of march and june the
eruptions are often attended with violent explosions smoke and
flames almost on the same parallel and also in the sea but
westward of the island (near punta de la brea and to the south of
the port of naparaimo) we find a similar vent on the neighbouring
coast in a clayey ground appears the celebrated lake of asphaltum

temperature as the atmosphere the small cones situated at the
south-western extremity of the island between point icacos and the
rio erin appear to have some analogy with the volcanoes of air and
mud which i met with at turbaco in the kingdom of new grenada i
mention these situations of asphaltum on account of the remarkable
circumstances peculiar to them in these regions for i am not
unaware that naphtha petroleum and asphaltum are found equally in
volcanic and secondary regions* and even more frequently in the
latter (* the inflammable emanations of pietra mala (consisting
of hydrogen gas containing naphtha in a state of suspension) issue
from the alpine limestone which may be traced from covigliano to
raticofa and which lies on ancient sandstone near scarica l'asino
under this sandstone (old red sandstone) we find black transition
limestone and the grauwack (quartzose psammite) of florence)

with explosions of which i acquired a knowledge in the vast
provinces of venezuela whilst travelling over a space of two
hundred leagues from east to west these various phenomena have
occasioned great excitement among the inhabitants since the
catastrophes of 1797 and 1812 yet they present nothing which
constitutes a volcano in the sense hitherto attributed to that
word if the apertures which throw up vapours and water with
violent noise be sometimes called volcancitos it is only by such
of the inhabitants as persuade themselves that volcanoes must
necessarily exist in countries so frequently exposed to
earthquakes advancing from the burning crater of st vincent in
the directions of south west and south-west first by the chain of
the caribbee islands then by the littoral chain of cumana and
venezuela and finally by the cordilleras of new grenada along a
distance of three hundred and eighty leagues we find no active
volcano before we arrive at purace near popayan the total absence
of apertures through which melted substances can issue in that
part of the continent which stretches eastward of the cordillera
of the andes and eastward of the rocky mountains is a most
remarkable geological fact

in this chapter we have examined the great commotions which from
time to time convulse the stony crust of the globe and scatter
desolation in regions favoured by the most precious gifts of
nature an uninterrupted calm prevails in the upper atmosphere
but to use an expression of franklin more ingenious than
accurate thunder often rolls in the subterranean atmosphere
amidst that mixture of elastic fluids the impetuous movements of
which are frequently felt at the surface of the earth the
destruction of so many populous cities presents a picture of the
greatest calamities which afflict mankind a people struggling for
independence are suddenly exposed to the want of subsistence and
of all the necessaries of life famished and without shelter the
inhabitants are dispersed through the country and numbers who have
escaped from the ruin of their dwellings are swept away by disease
far from strengthening mutual confidence among the citizens the
feeling of misfortune destroys it physical calamities augment
civil discord nor does the aspect of a country bathed in tears and
blood appease the fury of the victorious party

after the recital of so many calamities the mind is soothed by
turning to consolatory remembrances when the great catastrophe of
caracas was known in the united states the congress assembled at
washington unanimously decreed that five ships laden with flour
should be sent to the coast of venezuela their cargoes to be
distributed among the most needy of the inhabitants the generous
contribution was received with the warmest gratitude and this
solemn act of a free people this mark of national interest of
which the advanced civilization of the old world affords but few
examples seemed to be a valuable pledge of the mutual sympathy
which ought for ever to unite the nations of north and south
america


chapter 115

departure from caracas
mountains of san pedro and of los teques
la victoria
valleys of aragua

to take the shortest road from caracas to the banks of the orinoco
we should have crossed the southern chain of mountains between
baruta salamanca and the savannahs of ocumare passed over the
steppes or llanos of orituco and embarked at cabruta near the
mouth of the rio guarico but this direct route would have deprived
us of the opportunity of surveying the valleys of aragua which are
the finest and most cultivated portion of the province of taking
the level of an important part of the chain of the coast by means
of the barometer and of descending the rio apure as far as its
junction with the orinoco a traveller who has the intention of
studying the configuration and natural productions of a country is
not guided by distances but by the peculiar interest attached to
the regions he may traverse this powerful motive led us to the
mountains of los teques to the hot springs of mariara to the
fertile banks of the lake of valencia and through the immense
savannahs of calabozo to san fernando de apure in the eastern part
of the province of varinas having determined on this route our
first direction was westward then southward and finally to
east-south-east so that we might enter the orinoco by the apure in
latitude 7 degrees 36 minutes 23 seconds

on the day on which we quitted the capital of venezuela we reached
the foot of the woody mountains which close the valley on the
south-west there we halted for the night and on the following day
we proceeded along the right bank of the rio guayra as far as the
village of antimano by a very fine road partly scooped out of the
rock we passed by la vega and carapa the church of la vega rises
very picturesquely above a range of hills covered with thick
vegetation scattered houses surrounded with date-trees seem to
denote the comfort of their inhabitants a chain of low mountains
separates the little river guayra from the valley of la pascua* (so
celebrated in the history of the country) (* valley of cortes or
easter valley so called because diego de losada after having
defeated the teques indians and their cacique guaycaypuro in the
mountains of san pedro spent the easter there in 1567 before
entering the valley of san francisco in the latter place he
founded the city of caracas) and from the ancient gold-mines of
baruta and oripoto ascending in the direction of carapa we enjoy
once more the sight of the silla which appears like an immense
dome with a cliff on the side next the sea this rounded summit
and the ridge of galipano crenated like a wall are the only
objects which in this basin of gneiss and mica-slate impress a
peculiar character on the landscape the other mountains have a
uniform and monotonous aspect

a little before reaching the village of antimano we observed on the
right a very curious geological phenomenon in hollowing the new
road out of the rock two large veins of gneiss were discovered in
the mica-slate they are nearly perpendicular intersecting all the
mica-slate strata and are from six to eight toises thick these
veins contain not fragments but balls or spheres of granular
diabasis* formed of concentric layers (* ur-grunstein i remember
having seen similar balls filling a vein in transition-slate near
the castle of schauenstein in the margravate of bayreuth i sent
several balls from antimano to the collection of the king of spain
at madrid) these balls are composed of lamellar feldspar and
hornblende closely commingled the feldspar approximates sometimes
to vitreous feldspar when disseminated in very thin laminae in a
mass of granular diabasis decomposed and emitting a strong
argillaceous smell the diameter of the spheres is very unequal
sometimes four or eight inches sometimes three or four feet their
nucleus which is more dense is without concentric layers and of
a very dark green hue inclining to black i could not perceive any
mica in them but what is very remarkable i found great
quantities of disseminated garnets these garnets are of a very
fine red and are found in the grunstein only they are neither in
the gneiss which serves as a cement to the balls nor in the
mica-slate which the veins traverse the gneiss the constituent
parts of which are in a state of considerable disintegration
contains large crystals of feldspar and though it forms the body
of the vein in the mica-slate it is itself traversed by threads of
quartz two inches thick and of very recent formation the aspect
of this phenomenon is very curious it appears as if cannon-balls
were embedded in a wall of rock i also thought i recognized in
these same regions in the montana de avila and at cabo blanco
east of la guayra a granular diabasis mixed with a small quantity
of quartz and pyrites and destitute of garnets not in veins but
in subordinate strata in the mica-slate this position is
unquestionably to be found in europe in primitive mountains but in
general the granular diabasis is more frequently connected with the
system of transition rocks especially with a schist
(ubergangs-thonschiefer) abounding in beds of lydian stone strongly
carburetted of schistose jasper* (kieselschiefer) ampelites*
(alaunschiefer) and black limestone

near antimano all the orchards were full of peach-trees loaded with
blossom this village the valle and the banks of the macarao
furnish great abundance of peaches quinces and other european
fruits for the market of caracas between antimano and ajuntas we
crossed the rio guayra seventeen times the road is very fatiguing
yet instead of making a new one it would perhaps be better to
change the bed of the river which loses a great quantity of water
by the combined effects of filtration and evaporation each
sinuosity forms a marsh more or less extensive this loss of water
is to be regretted in a province nearly all the cultivated
portions of which are extremely dry the rains are much less
frequent and less violent in this place than in the interior of new
andalusia at cumanacoa and on the banks of the guarapiche many
of the mountains of caracas enter the region of the clouds but the
strata of primitive rocks dip at an angle of 70 or 80 degrees and
generally to northwest so that the waters are either lost in the
interior of the earth or gush out in copious springs not southward
but northward of the mountains of the coast of niguatar avila and
mariara the rising of the gneiss and mica-slate strata to the
south appears to me to explain in a considerable degree the extreme
humidity of the coast in the interior of the province we meet with
portions of land two or three leagues square in which there are
no springs consequently sugar-cane indigo and coffee grow only
in places where running waters can be made to supply artificial
irrigation during very dry weather the early colonists imprudently
destroyed the forests evaporation is enormous on a stony soil
surrounded with rocks which radiate heat on every side the
mountains of the coast like a wall extending east and west from
cape codera toward point tucacas prevent the humid air of the
shore (that is to say those inferior strata of the atmosphere
resting immediately on the sea and dissolving the largest
proportion of water) from penetrating to the islands there are few
openings few ravines which like those of catia or of tipe lead
from the coast to the high longitudinal valleys and there is no
bed of a great river no gulf allowing the sea to flow inland
spreading moisture by abundant evaporation in the eighth and tenth
degrees of latitude in regions where the clouds do not as it
were skim the surface of the soil many trees are stripped of
their leaves in the months of january and february not by the
sinking of the temperature as in europe but because the air at
this period the most distant from the rainy season nearly attains
its maximum of dryness only those plants which have very tough and
glossy leaves resist this absence of humidity beneath the fine sky
of the tropics the traveller is struck with the almost hibernal
aspect of the country but the freshest verdure again appears when
he reaches the banks of the orinoco where another climate
prevails and the great forests preserve by their shade a certain
quantity of moisture in the soil by sheltering it from the
devouring heat of the sun

beyond the small village of antimano the valley becomes much
narrower the river is bordered with lata a fine gramineous plant
with distich leaves which sometimes reaches the height of thirty
feet* (* g saccharoides) every hut is surrounded with enormous
trees of persea* (* laurus persea (alligator pear)) at the foot
of which the aristolochiae paullinia and other creepers vegetate
the neighbouring mountains covered with forests seem to spread
humidity over the western extremity of the valley of caracas we
passed the night before our arrival at las ajuntas at a sugar-cane
plantation a square house (the hacienda or farm of don fernando
key-munoz) contained nearly eighty negroes they were lying on
skins of oxen spread upon the ground in each apartment of the
house were four slaves it looked like a barrack a dozen fires
were burning in the farm-yard where people were employed in
dressing food and the noisy mirth of the blacks almost prevented
us from sleeping the clouds hindered me from observing the stars
the moon appeared only at intervals the aspect of the landscape
was dull and uniform and all the surrounding hills were covered
with aloes workmen were employed at a small canal intended for
conveying the waters of the rio san pedro to the farm at a height
of more than seventy feet according to a barometric calculation
the site of the hacienda is only fifty toises above the bed of the
rio guayra at la noria near caracas

the soil of these countries is found to be but little favourable to
the cultivation of the coffee-tree which in general is less
productive in the valley of caracas than was imagined when the
first plantations were made near chacao the finest
coffee-plantations are now found in the savannah of ocumare near
salamanca and at rincon in the mountainous countries of los
mariches san antonio hatillo and los budares the coffee of the
three last mentioned places situated eastward of caracas is of a
superior quality but the trees bear a smaller quantity which is
attributed to the height of the spot and the coolness of the
climate the greater plantations of the province of venezuela (as
aguacates near valencia and rincon) yield in good years a produce
of three thousand quintals

the extreme predilection entertained in this province for the
culture of the coffee-tree is partly founded on the circumstance
that the berry can be preserved during a great number of years
whereas notwithstanding every possible care cacao spoils in the
warehouses after ten or twelve months during the long dissensions
of the european powers at a time when spain was too weak to
protect the commerce of her colonies industry was directed in
preference to productions of which the sale was less urgent and
could await the chances of political and commercial events i
remarked that in the coffee-plantations the nurseries are formed
not so much by collecting together young plants accidentally
rising under trees which have yielded a crop as by exposing the
seeds of coffee to germination during five days in heaps between
plantain leaves these seeds are taken out of the pulp but yet
retaining a part of it adherent to them when the seed has
germinated it is sown and it produces plants capable of bearing
the heat of the sun better than those which spring up in the shade
in coffee-plantations in this country five thousand three hundred
coffee-trees are generally planted in a fanega of ground amounting
to five thousand four hundred and seventy-six square toises this
land if it be capable of artificial irrigation costs five hundred
piastres in the northern part of the province the coffee-tree
flowers only in the second year and its flowering lasts only
twenty-four hours at this time the shrub has a charming
appearance and when seen from afar it appears covered with snow
the produce of the third year becomes very abundant in plantations
well weeded and watered and recently cultivated trees will bear
sixteen eighteen and even twenty pounds of coffee in general
however more than a pound and a half or two pounds cannot be
expected from each plant and even this is superior to the mean
produce of the west india islands the coffee trees suffer much
from rain at the time of flowering as well as from the want of
water for artificial irrigation and also from a parasitic plant a
new species of loranthus which clings to the branches when in
plantations of eighty or a hundred thousand shrubs we consider the
immense quantity of organic matter contained in the pulpy berry of
the coffee-tree we may be astonished that no attempts have been
made to extract a spirituous liquor from them* (* the berries
heaped together produce a vinous fermentation during which a very
pleasant alcoholic smell is emitted placing at caracas the ripe
fruit of the coffee-tree under an inverted jar quite filled with
water and exposed to the rays of the sun i remarked that no
extrication of gas took place in the first twenty-four hours after
thirty-six hours the berries became brown and yielded gas a
thermometer enclosed in the jar in contact with the fruit kept at
night 4 or 5 degrees higher than the external air in the space of
eighty-seven hours sixty berries under various jars yielded me
from thirty-eight to forty cubic inches of a gas which underwent
no sensible diminution with nitrous gas though a great quantity of
carbonic acid had been absorbed by the water as it was produced i
still found 078 in the forty inches the remainder or 022 was
nitrogen the carbonic acid had not been formed by the absorption
of the atmospheric oxygen that which is evolved from the berries
of the coffee-tree slightly moistened and placed in a phial with a
glass stopple filled with air contains alcohol in suspension like
the foul air which is formed in our cellars during the fermentation
of must on agitating the gas in contact with water the latter
acquires a decidedly alcoholic flavour how many substances are
perhaps contained in a state of suspension in those mixtures of
carbonic acid and hydrogen which are called deleterious miasmata
and which rise everywhere within the tropics in marshy grounds on
the sea-shore and in forests where the soil is strewed with dead
leaves rotten fruits and putrefying insects)

if the troubles of st domingo the temporary rise in the price of
colonial produce and the emigration of french planters were the
first causes of the establishment of coffee plantations on the
continent of america in the island of cuba and in jamaica their
produce has far more than compensated the deficiency of the
exportation from the french west india islands this produce has
augmented in proportion to the population the change of customs
and the increasing luxury of the nations of europe the island of
st domingo exported in 1700 at the time of necker's
administration nearly seventy-six million pounds of coffee* (*
french pounds containing 9216 grains 112 english pounds = 105
french pounds and 160 spanish pounds = 93 french pounds the
island of st domingo was at that time it must be remembered a
french colony)

tea could be cultivated as well as coffee in the mountainous parts
of the provinces of caracas and cumana every climate is there
found rising in stages one above another and this new culture
would succeed there as well as in the southern hemisphere where
the government of brazil protecting at the same time industry and
religious toleration suffered at once the introduction of chinese
tea and of the dogmas of fo it is not yet a century since the
first coffee-trees were planted at surinam and in the west india
islands and already the produce of america amounts to fifteen
millions of piastres reckoning the quintal of coffee at fourteen
piastres only

on the eighth of february we set out at sunrise to cross the
higuerote a group of lofty mountains separating the two
longitudinal valleys of caracas and aragua after passing near las
ajuntas the junction of the two small rivers san pedro and
macarao which form the rio guayra we ascended a steep hill to the
table-land of la buenavista where we saw a few lonely houses the
view extends on the north-west to the city of caracas and on the
south to the village of los teques the country has a very wild
aspect and is thickly wooded we had now gradually lost the plants
of the valley of caracas* (* the flora of caracas is characterized
chiefly by the following plants which grow between the heights of
four hundred and six hundred toises cipura martinicensis panicum
mieranthum parthenium hysterophorus vernonia odoratissima

hundred and thirty-five toises above the level of the ocean which
is almost the height of popayan but the mean temperature of this
place is probably only 17 or 18 degrees the road over these
mountains is much frequented we met continually long files of
mules and oxen it is the great road leading from the capital to la
victoria and the valleys of aragua this road is cut out of a
talcose gneiss* in a state of decomposition (* the direction of
the strata of gneiss varies it is either hor 34 dipping to the
north-west or hor 82 dipping to the south-east) a clayey soil
mixed with spangles of mica covered the rock to the depth of three
feet travellers suffer from the dust in winter while in the rainy
season the place is changed into a slough on descending the
table-land of buenavista about fifty toises to the south-east an
abundant spring gushing from the gneiss forms several cascades
surrounded with thick vegetation the path leading to the spring is
so steep that we could touch with our hands the tops of the
arborescent ferns the trunks of which reach a height of more than
twenty-five feet the surrounding rocks are covered with
jungermannias and hypnoid mosses the torrent formed by the
spring and shaded with heliconias uncovers as it falls the
roots of the plumerias* (* the red jasmine-tree frangipanier of
the french west india islands the plumeria so common in the
gardens of the indians has been very seldom found in a wild state
it is mixed here with the piper flagellare the spadix of which
sometimes reaches three feet long with the new kind of fig-tree
(which we have called ficus gigantea because it frequently attains
the height of a hundred feet) we find in the mountains of
buenavista and of los teques the ficus nymphaeifolia of the garden
of schonbrunn introduced into our hot-houses by m bredemeyer i
am certain of the identity of the species found in the same places
but i doubt really whether it be really the f nymphaeifolia of
linnaeus which is supposed to be a native of the east indies)
cupeys* (* in the experiments i made at caracas on the air which
circulates in plants i was struck with the fine appearance
presented by the petioles and leaves of the clusia rosea when cut
open under water and exposed to the rays of the sun each trachea
gives out a current of gas purer by 008 than atmospheric air the
phenomenon ceases the moment the apparatus is placed in the shade
there is only a very slight disengagement of air at the two
surfaces of the leaves of the clusia exposed to the sun without
being cut open the gas enclosed in the capsules of the
cardiospermum vesicarium appeared to me to contain the same
proportion of oxygen as the atmosphere while that contained
between the knots in the hollow of the stalk is generally less
pure containing only from 012 to 015 of oxygen it is necessary
to distinguish between the air circulating in the tracheae and
that which is stagnant in the great cavities of the stems and
pericarps) browneas and ficus gigantea this humid spot though
infested by serpents presents a rich harvest to the botanist the
brownea which the inhabitants call rosa del monte or palo de
cruz bears four or five hundred purple flowers together in one
thyrsus each flower has invariably eleven stamina and this
majestic plant the trunk of which grows to the height of fifty or
sixty feet is becoming rare because its wood yields a highly
valued charcoal the soil is covered with pines (ananas)
hemimeris polygala and melastomas a climbing gramen* (* carice
see chapter 6) with its light festoons unites trees the presence
of which attests the coolness of the climate of these mountains
such are the aralia capitata* (* candelero we found it also at la
cumbre at a height of 700 toises) the vismia caparosa and the
clethra fagifolia among these plants peculiar to the fine region
of the arborescent ferns* (* called by the inhabitants of the
country region de los helechos) some palm-trees rise in the
openings and some scattered groups of guarumo or cecropia with
silvery leaves the trunks of the latter are not very thick and
are of a black colour towards the summit as if burnt by the oxygen
of the atmosphere we are surprised to find so noble a tree which
has the port of the theophrasta and the palm-tree bearing
generally only eight or ten terminal leaves the ants which
inhabit the trunk of the guarumo or jarumo and destroy its
interior cells seem to impede its growth we had already made one
herborization in the temperate mountains of the higuerote in the
month of december accompanying the capitan-general senor de
guevara in an excursion with the intendant of the province to the
valles de aragua m bonpland then found in the thickest part of
the forest some plants of aguatire the wood of which celebrated
for its fine red colour will probably one day become an article of
exportation to europe it is the sickingia erythroxylon described
by bredemeyer and willdenouw

descending the woody mountain of the higuerote to the south-west
we reached the small village of san pedro situated in a basin
where several valleys meet and almost three hundred toises lower
than the table-land of buenavista plantain-trees potatoes* (*
solanum tuberosum) and coffee are cultivated together on this
spot the village is very small and the church not yet finished
we met at an inn (pulperia) several european spaniards employed at
the government tobacco farm their dissatisfaction formed a strange
contrast to our feelings they were fatigued with their journey
and they vented their displeasure in complaints and maledictions on
the wretched country or to use their own phrase estas tierras
infelices in which they were doomed to live we on the other
hand were enchanted with the wild scenery the fertility of the
soil and the mildness of the climate near san pedro the talcose
gneiss of buenavista passes into a mica-slate filled with garnets
and containing subordinate beds of serpentine something analogous
to this is met with at zoblitz in saxony the serpentine which is
very pure and of a fine green varied with spots of a lighter tint
often appears only superimposed on the mica-slate i found in it a
few garnets but no metaloid diallage

the valley of san pedro through which flows the river of the same
name separates two great masses of mountains the higuerote and
las cocuyzas we ascended westward in the direction of the small
farms of las lagunetos and garavatos these are solitary houses
which serve as inns and where the mule-drivers obtain their
favourite beverage the guarapo or fermented juice of the
sugar-cane intoxication is very common among the indians who
frequent this road near garavatos there is a mica-slate rock of
singular form it is a ridge or steep wall crowned by a tower we
opened the barometer at the highest point of the mountain las
cocuyzas* (* absolute height 845 toises) and found ourselves
almost at the same elevation as on the table-land of buenavista
which is scarcely ten toises higher

the prospect at las lagunetas is extensive but rather uniform
this mountainous and uncultivated tract of ground between the
sources of the guayra and the tuy is more than twenty-five square
leagues in extent we there found only one miserable village that
of los teques south-east of san pedro the soil is as it were
furrowed by a multitude of valleys the smallest of which parallel
with each other terminate at right angles in the largest valleys
the back of the mountains presents an aspect as monotonous as the
ravines it has no pyramidal forms no ridges no steep
declivities i am inclined to think that the undulation of this
ground which is for the most part very gentle is less owing to
the nature of the rocks (to the decomposition of the gneiss for
instance) than to the long presence of the water and the action of
currents the limestone mountains of cumana present the same
phenomenon north of tumiriquiri

from las lagunetas we descended into the valley of the rio tuy
this western slope of the mountains of los teques bears the name of
las cocuyzas and it is covered with two plants with agave leaves
the maguey of cocuyza and the maquey of cocuy the latter belongs
to the genus yucca* (* yucca acaulis humb) its sweet and
fermented juice yields a spirit by distillation and i have seen
the young leaves of this plant eaten the fibres of the full-grown
leaves furnish cords of extraordinary strength* (* at the clock of
the cathedral of caracas a cord of maguey half an inch in
diameter sustained for fifteen years a weight of 350 pounds)
leaving the mountains of the higuerote and los teques we entered a
highly cultivated country covered with hamlets and villages
several of which would in europe be called towns from east to
west on a line of twelve leagues in extent we passed la victoria
san mateo turmero and maracay containing together more than 28
000 inhabitants the plains of the tuy may be considered as the
eastern extremity of the valleys of aragua extending from guigne
on the borders of the lake of valencia as far as the foot of las
cocuyzas a barometrical measurement gave me 295 toises for the
absolute height of the valle del tuy near the farm of manterola
and 222 toises for that of the surface of the lake the rio tuy
flowing from the mountains of las cocuyzas runs first towards the
west then turning to the south and to the east it takes its
course along the high savannahs of ocumare receives the waters of
the valley of caracas and reaches the sea near cape codera it is
the small portion of its basin in the westward direction which
geologically speaking would seem to belong to the valley of
aragua if the hills of calcareous tufa breaking the continuity of
these valleys between consejo and la victoria did not deserve some
consideration we shall here again remind the reader that the group
of the mountains of los teques eight hundred and fifty toises
high separates two longitudinal valleys formed in gneiss
granite and mica-slate the most eastern of these valleys
containing the capital of caracas is 200 toises higher than the
western valley which may be considered as the centre of
agricultural industry

having been for a long time accustomed to a moderate temperature
we found the plains of the tuy extremely hot although the
thermometer kept in the day-time between eleven in the morning
and five in the afternoon at only 23 or 24 degrees the nights
were delightfully cool the temperature falling as low as 175
degrees as the heat gradually abated the air became more and more
fragrant with the odour of flowers we remarked above all the
delicious perfume of the lirio hermoso* (* pancratium undulatum)
a new species of pancratium of which the flower eight or nine
inches long adorns the banks of the rio tuy we spent two very
agreeable days at the plantation of don jose de manterola who in
his youth had accompanied the spanish embassy to russia the farm
is a fine plantation of sugar-canes and the ground is as smooth as
the bottom of a drained lake the rio tuy winds through districts
covered with plantains and a little wood of hura crepitans
erythrina corallodendron and fig-trees with nymphaea leaves the
bed of the river is formed of pebbles of quartz i never met with
more agreeable bathing than in the tuy the water as clear as
crystal preserves even during the day a temperature of 186
degrees a considerable coolness for these climates and for a
height of three hundred toises but the sources of the river are in
the surrounding mountains the house of the proprietor situated on
a hillock of fifteen or twenty toises of elevation is surrounded
by the huts of the negroes those who are married provide food for
themselves and here as everywhere else in the valleys of aragua
a small spot of ground is allotted to them to cultivate they
labour on that ground on saturdays and sundays the only days in
the week on which they are free they keep poultry and sometimes
even a pig their masters boast of their happiness as in the north
of europe the great landholders love to descant upon the ease
enjoyed by peasants who are attached to the glebe on the day of
our arrival we saw three fugitive negroes brought back they were
slaves newly purchased i dreaded having to witness one of those
punishments which wherever slavery prevails destroys all the
charm of a country life happily these blacks were treated with
humanity

in this plantation as in all those of the province of venezuela
three species of sugar-cane can be distinguished even at a distance
by the colour of their leaves the old creole sugar-cane the
otaheite cane and the batavia cane the first has a deep-green
leaf the stem not very thick and the knots rather near together
this sugar-cane was the first introduced from india into sicily
the canary islands and west indies the second is of a lighter
green and its stem is higher thicker and more succulent the
whole plant exhibits a more luxuriant vegetation we owe this plant
to the voyages of bougainville cook and bligh bougainville
carried it to the mauritius whence it passed to cayenne
martinique and since 1792 to the rest of the west india islands
the sugar-cane of otaheite called by the people of that island to
is one of the most important acquisitions for which colonial
agriculture is indebted to the travels of naturalists it yields
not only one-third more juice than the creolian cane on the same
space of ground but from the thickness of its stem and the
tenacity of its ligneous fibres it furnishes much more fuel this
last advantage is important in the west indies where the
destruction of the forests has long obliged the planters to use
canes deprived of juice to keep up the fire under the boilers but
for the knowledge of this new plant together with the progress of
agriculture on the continent of spanish america and the
introduction of the east india and java sugar the prices of
colonial produce in europe would have been much more sensibly
affected by the revolutions of st domingo and the destruction of
the great sugar plantations of that island the otaheite sugar-cane
was carried from the island of trinidad to caracas under the name
of cana solera and it passed from caracas to cucuta and san gil in
the kingdom of new grenada in our days its cultivation during
twenty-five years has almost entirely removed the apprehension at
first entertained that being transplanted to america the cane
would by degrees degenerate and become as slender as the creole
cane the third species the violet sugar-cane called cana de
batavia or de guinea is certainly indigenous in the island of
java where it is cultivated in preference in the districts of
japara and pasuruan* (* raffles history of java tome 1 page 124)
its foliage is purple and very broad and this cane is preferred in
the province of caracas for rum the tablones or grounds planted
with sugar-canes are divided by hedges of a colossal gramen the
lata or gynerium with distich leaves at the tuy men were
employed in finishing a dyke to form a canal of irrigation this
enterprise had cost the proprietor seven thousand piastres for the
expense of labour and four thousand piastres for the costs of
lawsuits in which he had become engaged with his neighbours while
the lawyers were disputing about a canal of which only one-half was
finished don jose de manterola began to doubt even of the
possibility of carrying the plan into execution i took the level
of the ground with a lunette d'epreuve on an artificial horizon
and found that the dam had been constructed eight feet too low
what sums of money have i seen expended uselessly in the spanish
colonies for undertakings founded on erroneous levelling

the valley of the tuy has its 'gold mine' like almost every part
of america inhabited by whites and backed by primitive mountains
i was assured that in 1780 foreign gold-gatherers had been
engaged in picking up grains of that metal and had established a
place for washing the sand in the quebrada del oro an overseer of
a neighbouring plantation had followed these indications and after
his death a waistcoat with gold buttons being found among his
clothes this gold according to the logic of the people here
could only have proceeded from a vein which the falling in of the
earth had rendered invisible in vain i objected that i could not
by the mere view of the soil without digging a large trench in the
direction of the vein judge of the existence of the mine i was
compelled to yield to the desire of my hosts for twenty years past
the overseer's waistcoat had been the subject of conversation in
the country gold extracted from the bosom of the earth is far more
alluring in the eyes of the vulgar than that which is the produce
of agricultural industry favoured by the fertility of the soil
and the mildness of the climate

north-west of the hacienda del tuy in the northern range of the
chain of the coast we find a deep ravine called the quebrada
seca because the torrent by which it was formed loses its waters
through the crevices of the rock before it reaches the extremity
of the ravine the whole of this mountainous country is covered
with thick vegetation we there found the same verdure as had
charmed us by its freshness in the mountains of buenavista and las
lagunetas wherever the ground rises as high as the region of the
clouds and where the vapours of the sea have free access in the
plains on the contrary many trees are stripped of a part of their
leaves during the winter and when we descend into the valley of
the tuy we are struck with the almost hibernal aspect of the
country the dryness of the air is such that the hygrometer of
deluc keeps day and night between 36 and 40 degrees at a distance
from the river scarcely any huras or piper-trees extend their
foliage over thickets destitute of verdure this seems owing to the
dryness of the air which attains its maximum in the month of
february and not as the european planters assert "to the seasons
of spain of which the empire extends as far as the torrid zone"
it is only plants transported from one hemisphere to the other
which in their organic functions in the development of their
leaves and flowers still retain their affinity to a distant
climate faithful to their habits they follow for a long time the
periodical changes of their native hemisphere in the province of
venezuela the trees stripped of their foliage begin to renew their
leaves nearly a month before the rainy season it is probable that
at this period the electrical equilibrium of the air is already
disturbed and the atmosphere although not yet clouded becomes
gradually more humid the azure of the sky is paler and the
elevated regions are loaded with light vapours uniformly diffused
this season may be considered as the awakening of nature it is a
spring which according to the received language of the spanish
colonies proclaims the beginning of winter and succeeds to the
heats of summer* (* that part of the year most abundant in rain is
called winter so that in terra firma the season which begins by
the winter solstice is designated by the name of summer and it is
usual to hear that it is winter on the mountains at the time when
summer prevails in the neighbouring plains)

indigo was formerly cultivated in the quebrada seca but as the
soil covered with vegetation cannot there concentrate so much heat
as the plains and the bottom of the tuy valley receive and radiate
the cultivation of coffee has been substituted in its stead as we
advanced in the ravine we found the moisture increase near the
hato at the northern extremity of the quebrada a torrent rolls
down over sloping beds of gneiss an aqueduct was being formed
there to convey the water to the plain without irrigation
agriculture makes no progress in these climates a tree of
monstrous size fixed our attention* (* hura crepitans) it lay on
the slope of the mountain above the house of the hato on the
least dislodgment of the earth its fall would have crushed the
habitation which it shaded it had therefore been burnt near its
foot and cut down in such a manner that it fell between some
enormous fig-trees which prevented it from rolling into the
ravine we measured the fallen tree and though its summit had been
burnt the length of its trunk was still one hundred and fifty-four
feet* (* french measure nearly fifty metres) it was eight feet
in diameter near the roots and four feet two inches at the upper
extremity

our guides less anxious than ourselves to measure the bulk of
trees continually pressed us to proceed onward and seek the 'gold
mine' this part of the ravine is little frequented and is not
uninteresting we made the following observations on the geological
constitution of the soil at the entrance of the quebrada seca we
remarked great masses of primitive saccharoidal limestone
tolerably fine grained of a bluish tint and traversed by veins of
calcareous spar of dazzling whiteness these calcareous masses must
not be confounded with the very recent depositions of tufa or
carbonate of lime which fill the plains of the tuy they form beds
of mica-slate passing into talc-slate* (* talkschiefer of werner
without garnets or serpentine not eurite or weisstein it is in
the mountains of buenavista that the gneiss manifests a tendency to
pass into eurite) the primitive limestone often simply covers this
latter rock in concordant stratification very near the hato the
talcose slate becomes entirely white and contains small layers of
soft and unctuous graphic ampelite* (* zeichenschiefer) some
pieces destitute of veins of quartz are real granular plumbago
which might be of use in the arts the aspect of the rock is very
singular in those places where thin plates of black ampelite
alternate with thin sinuous and satiny plates of a talcose slate
as white as snow it would seem as if the carbon and iron which in
other places colour the primitive rocks are here concentrated in
the subordinate strata

turning westward we reached at length the ravine of gold (quebrada
del oro) on examining the slope of a hill we could hardly
recognize the vestige of a vein of quartz the falling of the earth
caused by the rains had changed the surface of the ground and
rendered it impossible to make any observation great trees were
growing in the places where the gold-washers had worked twenty
years before it is probable that the mica-slate contains here as
near goldcronach in franconia and in salzburgh auriferous veins
but how is it possible to judge whether they be worth the expense
of being wrought or whether the ore is only in nodules and in the
less abundance in proportion as it is rich? we made a long
herborization in a thick forest extending beyond the hato and
abounding in cedrelas browneas and fig-trees with nymphaea
leaves the trunks of these last are covered with very odoriferous
plants of vanilla which in general flower only in the month of
april we were here again struck with those ligneous excrescences
which in the form of ridges or ribs augment to the height of
twenty feet above the ground the thickness of the trunk of the
fig-trees of america i found trees twenty-two feet and a half in
diameter near the roots these ligneous ridges sometimes separate
from the trunk at a height of eight feet and are transformed into
cylindrical roots two feet thick the tree looks as if it were
supported by buttresses this scaffolding however does not
penetrate very deep into the earth the lateral roots wind at the
surface of the ground and if at twenty feet distance from the
trunk they are cut with a hatchet we see gushing out the milky
juice of the fig-tree which when deprived of the vital influence
of the organs of the tree is altered and coagulates what a
wonderful combination of cells and vessels exist in these vegetable
masses in these gigantic trees of the torrid zone which without
interruption perhaps during the space of a thousand years prepare
nutritious fluids raise them to the height of one hundred and
eighty feet convey them down again to the ground and conceal
beneath a rough and hard bark under inanimate layers of ligneous
matter all the movements of organic life

i availed myself of the clearness of the nights to observe at the
plantation of tuy two emersions of the first and third satellites
of jupiter these two observations gave according to the tables of
delambre longitude 4 hours 39 minutes 14 seconds and by the
chronometer i found 4 hours 39 minutes 10 seconds during my stay
in the valleys of the tuy and aragua the zodiacal light appeared
almost every night with extraordinary brilliancy i had perceived
it for the first time between the tropics at caracas on the 18th
of january after seven in the evening the point of the pyramid
was at the height of 53 degrees the light totally disappeared at
9 hours 35 minutes (apparent time) nearly 3 hours 50 minutes after
sunset without any diminution in the serenity of the sky la caille
in his voyage to rio janeiro and the cape was struck with the
beautiful appearance displayed by the zodiacal light within the
tropics not so much on account of its less inclined position
as of the greater transparency of the air* (* the great serenity
of the air caused this phenomenon to be remarked in 1668 in the
arid plains of persia) it may appear singular that childrey and
dominic cassini navigators who were well acquainted with the seas
of the two indies did not at a much earlier period direct the
attention of scientific europe to this light and its regular form
and progress until the middle of the eighteenth century mariners
were little interested by anything not having immediate relation
to the course of a ship and the demands of navigation

however brilliant the zodiacal light in the dry valley of tuy i
have observed it more beautiful still at the back of the
cordilleras of mexico on the banks of the lake of tezcuco eleven
hundred and sixty toises above the surface of the ocean in the
month of january 1804 the light rose sometimes to more than 60
degrees above the horizon the milky way appeared to grow pale
compared with the brilliancy of the zodiacal light and if small
bluish scattered clouds were accumulated toward the west it
seemed as if the moon were about to rise

i must here relate another very singular fact on the 18th of
january and the 15th of february 1800 the intensity of the
zodiacal light changed in a very perceptible manner at intervals
of two or three minutes sometimes it was very faint at others it
surpassed the brilliancy of the milky way in sagittarius the
changes took place in the whole pyramid especially toward the
interior far from the edges during these variations of the
zodiacal light the hygrometer indicated considerable dryness the
stars of the fourth and fifth magnitude appeared constantly to the
naked eye with the same degree of light no stream of vapour was
visible nothing seemed to alter the transparency of the
atmosphere in other years i saw the zodiacal light augment in the
southern hemisphere half an hour before its disappearance cassini
admitted "that the zodiacal light was feebler in certain years and
then returned to its former brilliancy" he thought that these slow
changes were connected with "the same emanations which render the
appearance of spots and faculae periodical on the solar disk" but
this excellent observer does not mention those changes of intensity
in the zodiacal light which i have several times remarked within
the tropics in the space of a few minutes mairan asserts that in
france it is common enough to see the zodiacal light in the months
of february and march mingling with a kind of aurora borealis
which he calls 'undecided' and the nebulous matter of which
spreads itself all around the horizon or appears toward the west
i very much doubt whether in the observations i have been
describing there was any mixture of these two species of light
the variations in intensity took place at considerable altitudes
the light was white and not coloured steady and not undulating
besides the aurora borealis is so seldom visible within the
tropics that during five years though almost constantly sleeping
in the open air and observing the heavens with unremitting
attention i never perceived the least traces of that phenomenon

i am rather inclined to think that the variations of the zodiacal
light are not all appearances dependent on certain modifications in
the state of our atmosphere sometimes during nights equally
clear i sought in vain for the zodiacal light when on the
previous night it had appeared with the greatest brilliancy must
we admit that emanations which reflect white light and seem to
have some analogy with the tails of comets are less abundant at
certain periods? researches on the zodiacal light have acquired a
new degree of interest since geometricians have taught us that we
are ignorant of the real causes of this phenomenon the illustrious
author of "la mecanique celeste" has shown that the solar
atmosphere cannot reach even the planet mercury and that it could
not in any case display the lenticular form which has been
attributed to the zodiacal light we may also entertain the same
doubts respecting the nature of this light as with regard to that
of the tails of comets is it in fact a reflected or a direct
light?

we left the plantation of manterola on the 11th of february at
sunrise the road runs along the smiling banks of the tuy the
morning was cool and humid and the air seemed embalmed by the
delicious odour of the pancratium undulatum and other large
liliaceous plants in our way to la victoria we passed the pretty
village of mamon or of consejo celebrated in the country for a
miraculous image of the virgin a little before we reached mamon
we stopped at a farm belonging to the family of monteras a negress
more than a hundred years old was seated before a small hut built
of earth and reeds her age was known because she was a creole
slave she seemed still to enjoy very good health "i keep her in
the sun" (la tengo al sol) said her grandson "the heat keeps her
alive" this appeared to us not a very agreeable mode of prolonging
life for the sun was darting his rays almost perpendicularly the
brown-skinned nations blacks well seasoned and indians
frequently attain a very advanced age in the torrid zone a native
of peru named hilario pari died at the extraordinary age of one
hundred and forty-three years after having been ninety years
married

don francisco montera and his brother a well-informed young
priest accompanied us with the view of conducting us to their
house at la victoria almost all the families with whom we had
lived in friendship at caracas were assembled in the fine valleys
of aragua and they vied with each other in their efforts to render
our stay agreeable before we plunged into the forests of the
orinoco we enjoyed once more all the advantages which advanced
civilization affords

the road from mamon to la victoria runs south and south-west we
soon lost sight of the river tuy which turning eastward forms an
elbow at the foot of the high mountains of guayraima as we drew
nearer to victoria the ground became smoother it seemed like the
bottom of a lake the waters of which had been drained off we
might have fancied ourselves in the valley of hasli in the canton
of berne the neighbouring hills only one hundred and forty toises
in height are composed of calcareous tufa but their abrupt
declivities project like promontories on the plain their form
indicates the ancient shore of the lake the eastern extremity of
this valley is parched and uncultivated no advantage has been
derived from the ravines which water the neighbouring mountains
but fine cultivation is commencing in the proximity of the town i
say of the town though in my time victoria was considered only as
a village (pueblo)

the environs of la victoria present a very remarkable agricultural
aspect the height of the cultivated ground is from two hundred and
seventy to three hundred toises above the level of the ocean and
yet we there find fields of corn mingled with plantations of
sugar-cane coffee and plantains excepting the interior of the
island of cuba* (* the district of quatro villas) we scarcely
find elsewhere in the equinoctial regions european corn cultivated
in large quantities in so low a region the fine fields of wheat in
mexico are between six hundred and twelve hundred toises of
absolute elevation and it is rare to see them descend to four
hundred toises we shall soon perceive that the produce of grain
augments sensibly from high latitudes towards the equator with
the mean temperature of the climate in comparing spots of
different elevations the success of agriculture depends on the
dryness of the air on the rains distributed through different
seasons or accumulated in one season on winds blowing constantly
from the east or bringing the cold air of the north into very low
latitudes as in the gulf of mexico on mists which for whole
months diminish the intensity of the solar rays in short on a
thousand local circumstances which have less influence on the mean
temperature of the whole year than on the distribution of the same
quantity of heat through the different parts of the year it is a
striking spectacle to see the grain of europe cultivated from the
equator as far as lapland in the latitude of 69 degrees in regions
where the mean heat is from 22 to-2 degrees in every place where
the temperature of summer is above 9 or 10 degrees we know the
minimum of heat requisite to ripen wheat barley and oats but we
are less certain in respect to the maximum which these species of
grain accommodating as they are can support we are even ignorant
of all the circumstances which favour the culture of corn within
the tropics at very small heights la victoria and the neighbouring
village of san mateo yield an annual produce of four thousand
quintals of wheat it is sown in the month of december and the
harvest is reaped on the seventieth or seventy-fifth day the grain
is large white and abounding in gluten its pellicle is thinner
and not so hard as that of the wheat of the very cold table-lands
of mexico an acre* (* an arpent des eaux et forets or legal acre
of france of which 195 = 1 hectare it is about 1 1/4 acre
english) near victoria generally yields from three thousand to
three thousand two hundred pounds weight of wheat the average
produce is consequently here as at buenos ayres three or four
times as much as that of northern countries nearly sixteenfold of
the quantity of seed is reaped while according to lavoisier the
surface of france yields on an average only five or six for one or
from one thousand to twelve hundred pounds per acre
notwithstanding this fecundity of the soil and this happy
influence of the climate the culture of the sugar-cane is more
productive in the valleys of aragua than that of corn

la victoria is traversed by the little river calanchas running
not into the tuy but into the rio aragua it thence results that
this fine country producing at once sugar and corn belongs to the
basin of the lake of valencia to a system of interior rivers not
communicating with the sea the quarter of the town west of the rio
calanchas is called la otra banda it is the most commercial part
merchandize is everywhere exhibited and ranges of shops form the
streets two commercial roads pass through la victoria that of
valencia or of porto cabello and the road of villa de cura or of
the plains called camino de los llanos we here find more whites
in proportion than at caracas we visited at sunset the little hill
of calvary where the view is extremely fine and extensive we
discover on the west the lovely valleys of aragua a vast space
covered with gardens cultivated fields clumps of wild trees
farms and hamlets turning south and south-east we see extending
as far as the eye can reach the lofty mountains of la palma
guayraima tiara and guiripa which conceal the immense plains or
steppes of calabozo this interior chain stretches westward along
the lake of valencia towards the villa de cura the cuesta de
yusma and the denticulated mountains of guigne it is very steep
and constantly covered with that light vapour which in hot climates
gives a vivid blue tint to distant objects and far from
concealing their outlines marks them the more strongly it is
believed that among the mountains of the interior chain that of
guayraima reaches an elevation of twelve hundred toises i found in
the night of the eleventh of february the latitude of la victoria
10 degrees 13 minutes 35 seconds the magnetic dip 408 degrees the
intensity of the forces equal to 236 oscillations in ten minutes of
time and the variation of the needle 44 degrees north-east

we proceeded slowly on our way by the villages of san mateo
turmero and maracay to the hacienda de cura a fine plantation
belonging to count tovar where we arrived on the evening of the
fourteenth of february the valley which gradually widens is
bordered with hills of calcareous tufa called here tierra blanca
the scientific men of the country have made several attempts to
calcine this earth mistaking it for the porcelain earth proceeding
from decomposed strata of feldspar we stayed some hours with a
very intelligent family named ustariz at concesion their house
which contains a collection of choice books stands on an eminence
and is surrounded by plantations of coffee and sugar-cane a grove
of balsam-trees (balsamo* (* amyris elata)) gives coolness and
shade to this spot it was gratifying to observe the great number
of scattered houses in the valley inhabited by freedmen in the
spanish colonies the laws the institutions and the manners are
more favourable to the liberty of the negroes than in other
european settlements

san mateo turmero and maracay are charming villages where
everything denotes the comfort of the inhabitants we seemed to be
transported to the most industrious districts of catalonia near
san mateo we find the last fields of wheat and the last mills with
horizontal hydraulic wheels a harvest of twenty for one was
expected and as if that produce were but moderate i was asked
whether corn yielded more in prussia and in poland by an error
generally prevalent under the tropics the produce of grain is
supposed to degenerate in advancing towards the equator and
harvests are believed to be more abundant in northern climates
since calculations have been made on the progress of agriculture in
the different zones and on the temperatures under the influence of
which corn will flourish it has been found that beyond the
latitude of 45 degrees the produce of wheat is nowhere so
considerable as on the northern coasts of africa and on the
table-lands of new grenada peru and mexico without comparing the
mean temperature of the whole year but only the mean temperature
of the season which embraces the corn cycle of vegetation we find
for three months of summer* in the north of europe from 15 to 19
degrees in barbary and in egypt from 27 to 29 degrees within the
tropics between fourteen and three hundred toises of height from
14 to 255 degrees of the centigrade thermometer (* the mean heat
of the summers of scotland in the environs of edinburgh (latitude
56 degrees) is found again on the table-lands of new grenada so
rich in wheat at 1400 toises of elevation and at 4 degrees north
latitude on the other hand we find the mean temperature of the
valleys of aragua latitude 10 degrees 13 minutes and of all the
plains which are not very elevated in the torrid zone in the
summer temperature of naples and sicily latitude 39 to 40 degrees
these figures indicate the situation of the isotheric lines (lines
of the same summer heat) and not that of the isothermal lines
(those of equal annual temperature) considering the quantity of
heat received on the same spot of the globe during a whole year
the mean temperatures of the valleys of aragua and the table-lands
of new grenada at 300 and 1400 toises of elevation correspond to
the mean temperatures of the coasts at 23 and 45 degrees of
latitude)

the fine harvests of egypt and of algiers as well as those of the
valleys of aragua and the interior of the island of cuba
sufficiently prove that the augmentation of heat is not prejudicial
to the harvest of wheat and other alimentary grain unless it be
attended with an excess of drought or moisture to this
circumstance no doubt we must attribute the apparent anomalies
sometimes observed within the tropics in the lower limit of corn
we are astonished to see eastward of the havannah in the famous
district of quatro villas that this limit descends almost to the
level of the ocean whilst west of the havannah on the slope of
the mountains of mexico and xalapa at six hundred and
seventy-seven toises of height the luxuriance of vegetation is
such that wheat does not form ears at the beginning of the
spanish conquest the corn of europe was cultivated with success in
several regions now supposed to be too hot or too damp for this
branch of agriculture the spaniards on their first removal to
america were little accustomed to live on maize they still adhered
to their european habits they did not calculate whether corn would
be less profitable than coffee or cotton they tried seeds of every
kind making experiments the more boldly because their reasonings
were less founded on false theories the province of carthagena
crossed by the chain of the mountains maria and guamoco produced
wheat till the sixteenth century in the province of caracas this
culture is of very ancient date in the mountainous lands of tocuyo
quibor and barquisimeto which connect the littoral chain with the
sierra nevada of merida wheat is still successfully cultivated
there and the environs of the town of tocuyo alone export annually
more than eight thousand quintals of excellent flour but though
the province of caracas in its vast extent includes several spots
very favourable to the cultivation of european corn i believe that
in general this branch of agriculture will never acquire any great
importance there the most temperate valleys are not sufficiently
wide they are not real table-lands and their mean elevation above
the level of the sea is not so considerable but that the
inhabitants cannot fail to perceive that it is more their interest
to establish plantations of coffee than to cultivate corn flour
now comes to caracas either from spain or from the united states

the village of turmero is four leagues distant from san mateo the
road leads through plantations of sugar indigo cotton and
coffee the regularity observable in the construction of the
villages reminded us that they all owe their origin to monks and
missions the streets are straight and parallel crossing each
other at right angles and the church is invariably erected in the
great square situated in the centre of the village the church of
turmero is a fine edifice but overloaded with architectural
ornaments since the missionaries have been replaced by vicars the
whites have mingled their habitations with those of the indians
the latter are gradually disappearing as a separate race that is
to say they are represented in the general statement of the
population by the mestizoes and the zamboes whose numbers daily
increase i still found however four thousand tributary indians
in the valleys of aragua those of turmero and guacara are the most
numerous they are of small stature but less squat than the
chaymas their eyes denote more vivacity and intelligence owing
less perhaps to a diversity in the race than to a superior state
of civilization they work like freemen by the day though active
and laborious during the short time they allot to labour yet what
they earn in two months is spent in one week in the purchase of
strong liquors at the small inns of which unhappily the numbers
daily increase

we saw at turmero the remains of the assembled militia of the
country and their appearance alone sufficiently indicated that
these valleys had enjoyed for ages undisturbed peace the
capitan-general in order to give a new impulse to the military
service had ordered a grand review and the battalion of turmero
in a mock fight had fired on that of la victoria our host a
lieutenant of the militia was never weary of describing to us the
danger of these manoeuvres which seemed more burlesque than
imposing with what rapidity do nations apparently the most
pacific acquire military habits twelve years afterwards those
valleys of aragua those peaceful plains of la victoria and
turmero the defile of cabrera and the fertile banks of the lake
of valencia became the scenes of obstinate and sanguinary
conflicts between the natives and the troops of the mother-country

south of turmero a mass of limestone mountains advances into the
plain separating two fine sugar-plantations guayavita and paja
the latter belongs to the family of count tovar who have property
in every part of the province near guayavita brown iron-ore has
been discovered to the north of turmero a granitic summit (the
chuao) rises in the cordillera of the coast from the top of which
we discern at once the sea and the lake of valencia crossing this
rocky ridge which runs towards the west farther than the eye can
reach paths somewhat difficult lead to the rich plantations of
cacao on the coast to choroni turiamo and ocumare noted alike
for the fertility of the soil and the insalubrity of their climate
turmero maracay cura guacara every point of the valley of
aragua has its mountain-road which terminates at one of the small
ports on the coast

on quitting the village of turmero we discover at a league
distant an object which appears at the horizon like a round
hillock or tumulus covered with vegetation it is neither a hill
nor a group of trees close to each other but one single tree the
famous zamang del guayre known throughout the province for the
enormous extent of its branches which form a hemispheric head five
hundred and seventy-six feet in circumference the zamang is a fine
species of mimosa and its tortuous branches are divided by
bifurcation its delicate and tender foliage was agreeably relieved
on the azure of the sky we stopped a long time under this
vegetable roof the trunk of the zamang del guayre* (* the mimos
of la guayre zamang being the indian name for the genera mimosa
desmanthus and acacia the place where the tree is found is called
el guayre) which is found on the road from turmero to maracay is
only sixty feet high and nine thick but its real beauty consists
in the form of its head the branches extend like an immense
umbrella and bend toward the ground from which they remain at a
uniform distance of twelve or fifteen feet the circumference of
this head is so regular that having traced different diameters i
found them one hundred and ninety-two and one hundred and
eighty-six feet one side of the tree was entirely stripped of its
foliage owing to the drought but on the other side there remained
both leaves and flowers tillandsias lorantheae cactus pitahaya
and other parasite plants cover its branches and crack the bark
the inhabitants of these villages but particularly the indians
hold in veneration the zamang del guayre which the first
conquerors found almost in the same state in which it now remains
since it has been observed with attention no change has appeared
in its thickness or height this zamang must be at least as old as
the orotava dragon-tree there is something solemn and majestic in
the aspect of aged trees and the violation of these monuments of
nature is severely punished in countries destitute of monuments of
art we heard with satisfaction that the present proprietor of the
zamang had brought an action against a cultivator who had been
guilty of cutting off a branch the cause was tried and the
tribunal condemned the offender we find near turmero and the
hacienda de cura other zamangs having trunks larger than that of
guayre but their hemispherical heads are not of equal extent

the culture and population of the plains augment in the direction
of cura and guacara on the northern side of the lake the valleys
of aragua contain more than 52000 inhabitants on a space thirteen
leagues in length and two in width this is a relative population
of two thousand souls on a square league the village or rather the
small town of maracay was heretofore the centre of the indigo
plantations when this branch of colonial industry was in its
greatest prosperity the houses are all of masonry and every court
contains cocoa-trees which rise above the habitations the aspect
of general wealth is still more striking at maracay than at
turmero the anil or indigo of these provinces has always been
considered in commerce as equal and sometimes superior to that of
guatemala the indigo plant impoverishes the soil where it is
cultivated during a long series of years more than any other the
lands of maracay tapatapa and turmero are looked upon as
exhausted and indeed the produce of indigo has been constantly
decreasing but in proportion as it has diminished in the valleys
of aragua it has increased in the province of varinas and in the
burning plains of cucuta where on the banks of the rio tachira
virgin land yields an abundant produce of the richest colour

we arrived very late at maracay and the persons to whom we were
recommended were absent the inhabitants perceiving our
embarrassment contended with each other in offering to lodge us
to place our instruments and take care of our mules it has been
said a thousand times but the traveller always feels desirous of
repeating it again that the spanish colonies are the land of
hospitality they are so even in those places where industry and
commerce have diffused wealth and improvement a family of
canarians received us with the most amiable cordiality an
excellent repast was prepared and everything was carefully avoided
that might act as any restraint on us the master of the house don
alexandro gonzales was travelling on commercial business and his
young wife had lately had the happiness of becoming a mother she
was transported with joy when she heard that on our return from the
rio negro we should proceed by the banks of the orinoco to
angostura where her husband was we were to bear to him the
tidings of the birth of his first child in those countries as
among the ancients travellers are regarded as the safest means of
communication there are indeed posts established but they make
such great circuits that private persons seldom entrust them with
letters for the llanos or savannahs of the interior the child was
brought to us at the moment of our departure we had seen him
asleep at night but it was deemed indispensable that we should see
him awake in the morning we promised to describe his features
exactly to his father but the sight of our books and instruments
somewhat chilled the mother's confidence she said "that in a long
journey amidst so many cares of another kind we might well forget
the colour of her child's eyes"

on the road from maracay to the hacienda de cura we enjoyed from
time to time the view of the lake of valencia an arm of the
granitic chain of the coast stretches southward into the plain it
is the promontory of portachuelo which would almost close the
valley were it not separated by a narrow defile from the rock of
la cabrera this place has acquired a sad celebrity in the late
revolutionary wars of caracas each party having obstinately
disputed its possession as opening the way to valencia and to the
llanos la cabrera now forms a peninsula not sixty years ago it
was a rocky island in the lake the waters of which gradually
diminish we spent seven very agreeable days at the hacienda da
cura in a small habitation surrounded by thickets

we lived after the manner of the rich in this country we bathed
twice slept three times and made three meals in the twenty-four
hours the temperature of the water of the lake is rather warm
being from twenty-four to twenty-five degrees but there is another
cool and delicious bathing-place at toma under the shade of ceibas
and large zamangs in a torrent gushing from the granitic mountains
of the rincon del diablo in entering this bath we had not to fear
the sting of insects but to guard against the little brown hairs
which cover the pods of the dolichos pruriens when these small
hairs well characterised by the name of picapica stick to the
body they excite a violent irritation on the skin the dart is
felt but the cause is unperceived

near cura we found all the people occupied in clearing the ground
covered with mimosa sterculia and coccoloba excoriata for the
purpose of extending the cultivation of cotton this product which
partly supplies the place of indigo has succeeded so well during
some years that the cotton-tree now grows wild on the borders of
the lake of valencia we have found shrubs of eight or ten feet
high entwined with bignonia and other ligneous creepers the
exportation of cotton from caracas however is yet of small
importance it amounted at an average at la guayra scarcely to
three or four hundred thousand pounds in a year but including all
the ports of the capitania-general it arose on account of the
flourishing culture of cariaco nueva barcelona and maracaybo to
more than 22000 quintals the cotton of the valleys of aragua is
of fine quality being inferior only to that of brazil for it is
preferred to that of carthagena st domingo and the caribbee
islands the cultivation of cotton extends on one side of the lake
from maracay to valencia and on the other from guayca to guigue
the large plantations yield from sixty to seventy thousand pounds a
year

during our stay at cura we made numerous excursions to the rocky
islands (which rise in the midst of the lake of valencia) to the
warm springs of mariara and to the lofty granitic mountain called
el cucurucho de coco a dangerous and narrow path leads to the port
of turiamo and the celebrated cacao-plantations of the coast in
all these excursions we were agreeably surprised not only at the
progress of agriculture but at the increase of a free laborious
population accustomed to toil and too poor to rely on the
assistance of slaves white and mulatto farmers had everywhere
small separate establishments our host whose father had a revenue
of 40000 piastres possessed more lands than he could clear he
distributed them in the valleys of aragua among poor families who
chose to apply themselves to the cultivation of cotton he
endeavoured to surround his ample plantations with freemen who
working as they chose either in their own land or in the
neighbouring plantations supplied him with day-labourers at the
time of harvest nobly occupied on the means best adapted gradually
to extinguish the slavery of the blacks in these provinces count
tovar flattered himself with the double hope of rendering slaves
less necessary to the landholders and furnishing the freedmen with
opportunities of becoming farmers on departing for europe he had
parcelled out and let a part of the lands of cura which extend
towards the west at the foot of the rock of las viruelas four
years after at his return to america he found on this spot
finely cultivated in cotton a little hamlet of thirty or forty
houses which is called punta zamuro and which we visited with
him the inhabitants of this hamlet are almost all mulattos
zamboes or free blacks this example of letting out land has been
happily followed by several other great proprietors the rent is
ten piastres for a fanega of ground and is paid in money or in
cotton as the small farmers are often in want they sell their
cotton at a very moderate price they dispose of it even before the
harvest and the advances made by rich neighbours place the
debtor in a situation of dependence which frequently obliges him
to offer his services as a labourer the price of labour is cheaper
here than in france a freeman working as a day-labourer (peon)
is paid in the valleys of aragua and in the llanos four or five
piastres per month not including food which is very cheap on
account of the abundance of meat and vegetables i love to dwell on
these details of colonial industry because they serve to prove to
the inhabitants of europe a fact which to the enlightened
inhabitants of the colonies has long ceased to be doubtful namely
that the continent of spanish america can produce sugar cotton
and indigo by free hands and that the unhappy slaves are capable
of becoming peasants farmers and landholdersto all patroling air units a 208 is in progress

there's nothing to worry about 

you can try it again once you're in our country 

''try it again?'' 

just as there's no such thing as a bug-free program 

there's no program that can't be debugged am l wrong? 

you don't understand 

we still don't know if it really is a bug 

project 2501's original purpose was  

major section 6 is ready to move in 

- major - l hear you 

there's a lot of static in your brain 

lt's that time of the month 

won't there be trouble if section 9 butts in on section 6's operation? 

that diplomat's a pretty well-known bastard 

even if they catch him there all they can do is deport him 

we're the only ones who can get our hands dirty 

they're moving take us over to the extraction point 

what? the police? 

stop it who told you to open fire? drop your guns 

l have diplomatic immunity let me see who's in charge 

transporting a listed programmer out of the country 

violates our arms export treaty 

l could also have you charged with kidnapping 

give the man up 

l'm afraid not he's applied for political asylum with us 

and he's already signed a statement to that effect 

- when? - l don't have to tell you 

by right of international law my country can 

offer him protection and right of safe passage 

the document is on file at our embassy 

l'll transfer a copy to you in a few days 

are you sure about this? they won't take you back alive 

l must ask that you watch what you say 

our country is a peace-loving democracy 

ls that a fact? 

out the window shoot 

thermoptic camouflage 

this is a rare pleasure mr aramaki 

what can the foreign ministry do for section 9? 

what are these secret talks you've scheduled with 

the gavel republic for tomorrow? 

the usual foreign aid 

the new government reopened the request after the revolution 

they claim to be more democratic 

but they'll probably be as bad as the last bunch 

giving them money they don't earn will help nobody 

they consider it reparation for past exploitation and won't thank  

and what will the government do? 

the problem is that we have the leader of 

the old junta here looking for political asylum 

col maless right? 

so do we throw him out and grant them the aid? 

or do we publicly recognize him as a refugee and cut the aid? 

not an easy decision to make 

personally if l could find a politically acceptable reason 

l'd have the man deported in a heartbeat 

oh yes thanks for your help with that programmer defection 

nakamura over in section 6 said he was grateful

the foreign minister's interpreter 

23 minutes ago her cyber-brain was hacked via telephone connection 

just as foreign lntelligence division predicted 

the puppet master has begun to break into 

every terminal on the network 

pattern analysis shows a high probability that 

he's attempting to disrupt secret talks with gavel 

we've placed everyone attending the talks under surveillance 

probably trying to hack her ghost 

so she'll kill people at the meeting 

how long till he hacks through her protection and reaches her ghost? 

he's using an old-style ha-3 l'd say about two hours 

after that we'll have to cut the line to eliminate all risk 

batou and lshikawa are in a car tracing the signal 

rendezvous with them 

the puppet master that phantom hacker right? 

they think he's an american 

age sex personal history everything about him is unknown 

since last winter he's been mainly active in the ec 

lnternationally wanted on dozens of charges of 

stock manipulation spying political engineering 

terrorism and violation of cyber-brain privacy 

he's ghost-hacked so many people to carry out his crimes 

he's earned the code name ''the puppet master'' 

this is the first instance of him operating in this country 

so if he's so hot why's he using an old ha-3? 

well a newer type would be less detectable and be harder to trace 

but it could also implicate the former junta leader col maless 

so he's using an older type to keep us from suspecting him 

or somebody else wants us to think that 

maless may just be another pawn in this whole thing 

now you're overthinking this there's no evidence of that 

evidence? 

l just have a whisper a whisper from my ghost 

by the way are you still using that revolver? 

afraid both guns in a two-man team'll jam up? 

l like the matever 

since l depend on your backup l think stopping power is 

more important than personal preference 

especially since it's my ass on the line 

use the zastaber instead 

major l've been meaning to ask you 

why'd you ask for a guy like me to be transferred in from the police? 

because you're a guy like you 

huh? 

an honest cop with a clean record and you've got a regular family 

with the exception of your cyber-net implants your brain's real 

no matter how powerful we may be fighting-wise 

a system where all the parts react the same way

overspecialization leads to death 

that's all

we're already 40 seconds behind schedule

hey sorry 

my last partner the one they busted for working without

she doesn't have any time for me and now she wants a divorce 

on top of that my daughter my only child

and he said he'd help 

told me to access from different places to keep from getting caught 

smart guy huh? 

asshole ya tryin' to get yourself killed? 

looks like we aren't the only busy people out here 

nobody here 

what's the point? even if we trace the calls 

the guy's already gone by the time we get there 

- vicious cycle huh? - quit complaining 

kusanagi and togusa are headed for the next expected hack point

l hate looking at other peoples' family albums 

yeah truck 79 oh boss what's up? 

the cops were checking our routes? you wanna know why? 

how should l know? 

they spotted the hack l gotta warn my friend 

we're gonna have to skip our next stop

and simultaneously confining ''me'' within set limits 

ls that why you dive into the sea with a body that only sinks? 

what is it you see in the water's darkness? 

''for now we see through a glass darkly'' 

that was you wasn't it? 

sensors restarted 

auxiliary computer link check 

visual sensors online 

- cyborg body signal? - output nominal 

can't you call in if you're going to be late? 

we're all set should we hook her up? 

okay looking good kill it 

be in my office in three minutes 

since you were late l'll explain what's going on 

two hours ago a megatech body assembly line in newport city 

just started up and produced a cyborg shell 

by the time the guys in charge realized what was happening 

the body had escaped 

then just as they had thrown up a cordon to catch the thing 

we got a call from a conscientious truck driver that 

he'd just run down a naked lady wandering around on the highway 

which brings us to here 

l've heard megatech body's tied pretty closely to the government 

and that all the shells made there are secret 

lf a hacker did this he had to swim through 

some of the heaviest protection around 

and that isn't the only problem 

of course it doesn't have an organic brain in its head 

but we've detected what looks like a ghost 

in the auxiliary computer brain 

lt isn't unlike the virtual ghost-line you get 

when a real ghost is dubbed off 

but it shows none of the data degradation dubbing would produce 

well until we map the barrier perimeter and dive in there 

we won't know anything for sure 

anyhow better get back to checking her over 

good work 

time to rip her apart 

come on you guys don't think there's a ghost in that thing 

lt's possible 

l've heard celluloid dolls can have a soul 

and this thing's stuffed full of neurotech devices 

l wouldn't be surprised if it had a soul 

since you're new here you probably don't know 

the major's shell was also made by megatech body 

not just hers me and lshikawa for one 

along with saito and others all need maintenance and such 

outside of you and the chief everyone in section 9 

needs to make use of their kind services 

maybe you can see now why we all look a little worried togusa 

assuming the enemy is an outsider we can't know for sure 

whether he's in that cyborg body or not 

but he cracked through the protection 

around some of our most secret files 

and managed to send a program with a ghost-line on it through 

and in a way that was easy to spot what's he after? 

let's leave that for now 

togusa get over to megatech and help lshikawa check the place out 

batou l've closed down the nets 

with files as sensitive as megatech's 

l want you to double-check the protection we have on them 

l'll get a protection maze put together l'll dive tomorrow 

you sure? we could force it into another shell and let it swim 

l have to see for myself what's inside that thing 

don't let anyone else dive in there before me 

what's with her? 

l wrote in my team evaluations that she's been acting weird 

ever since this puppet master case fell into our laps 

do you even read them? 

chief do you ever wonder just how trustworthy the cyberdocs 

who service your brain are? 

cyber-brain technicians undergo regular psychological testing 

and security-cleared ones have their private lives checked too 

but the people who administer those checks are only human 

once you doubt you can't stop 

chief a mr nakamura from the mfa treaties bureau to see you 

okay send him up 

wasn't that fat guy? 

nakamura chief of section 6 foreign affairs treaties bureau 

l don't know who the white guy with him was 

l'm outta here 

tell lshikawa to keep cool okay? 

so what's your problem? 

doesn't that cyborg body look like me? 

- no it doesn't - not the face or the figure 

what then? 

maybe all full-replacement cyborgs like me start wondering this 

that perhaps the real me died a long time ago 

and l'm a replicant made with a cyborg body and computer brain 

or maybe there never was a real ''me'' to begin with 

you've got real brain matter in that titanium skull of yours 

and you get treated like a real person don't you? 

there's no person who's ever seen their own brain 

l believe l exist based only on what my environment tells me 

don't you believe in your own ghost? 

and what if a computer brain could generate a ghost 

and harbor a soul? 

on what basis then do l believe in myself? 

bullshit 

l'll see for myself what's in that body with my own ghost 

we're both busy men so let's keep this short 

l would prefer that 

l'm here to take the contents of that cyborg body 

ln return we absolve section 9 of all responsibilities in the case 

the foreign minister's signature 

security whose official vehicles are parked in the basement garage? 

they belong to chief nakamura of the treaties bureau and a dr willis 

give me the video record of their entering the building 

replay infra-red view 

one two three 

send me the pressure sensor records for basement garage spaces b-7 and 8 

- major this is togusa code 0-9 - what? 

does nakamura have some sort of special cyborg body? 

there are no cyborgs in section 6 

besides the diplomatic problems maintaining them is too much 

trouble when they have to go overseas 

so even if that tall guy was a cyborg himself 

together they wouldn't weigh more than half a ton right? 

pressure sensor data the garage? 

there are two vlp-mobiles here 

but neither of them looks like the type who'd drive himself 

the security video only shows the two of them 

but you know how sensitive the entrance door sensors are 

they took three full seconds to close after them 

lt's illegal to use thermoptic camo in a government building right? 

lt's a serious violation of the national security act 

section 6 is up to something you all ready? 

lf my matever'll do 

l don't need to remind you that it's treason for you to 

be hiding something from me no matter how sensitive 

for both of us 

whatever the mfa may prefer this case is in section 9's jurisdiction 

but we wouldn't mind cooperating if there was good reason to 

dr willis? 

confirmed lt's definitely him 

''him?'' 

he's referring to the original ghost block within the shell 

lts sex remains undetermined and the use of the term ''he'' 

is merely a nickname the good doctor has given it 

perhaps it's time l introduced you 

this is the most unique hacker in the history of cyber-brain crime 

the puppet master 

l believe you in section 9 ran into him in that case 

involving the ghost-hack on the foreign minister's translatior 

we in section 6 have been pursuing the puppet master 

with the utmost urgency since he first appeared 

we formed a project team around dr willis 

to analyze all data on the puppet master's 

criminal tendencies and behavior patterns 

we then constructed special anti-puppet master attack protection 

to lure him into a secret cyborg body 

you made him dive into a body equipped with a cyber-brain 

and then had his real body killed? 

yes exactly 

he may have shown up in your back yard 

but he was born in america and since we were cooperating 

with the americans to catch him we want to take him back ourselves 

surely you've no objections 

leaving his unidentified corpse to be found somewhere 

there will be no corpse 

because until now there never was a body 

the sensors are active why didn't you say so? 

we've cut all external controls lt's running on internal power 

l may have entered this cyborg body because 

l was unable to crack section 6's attack protection 

but it was of my own free will that l came here 

as an autonomous life-form l request political asylum 

a life-form? 

ridiculous you're merely a self-preserving program 

by that argument l submit the dna you carry is 

nothing more than a self-preserving program itself 

life is like a node which is born within the flow of information 

as a species of life that carries dna as its memory system 

man gains his individuality from the memories he carries 

while memories may as well be the same as fantasy 

it is by these memories that mankind exists 

when computers made it possible to externalize memory 

you should have considered all the implications that held 

nonsense no matter what you say 

you've no proof that you're a life-form 

lt is impossible to prove such a thing 

especially since modern science cannot define what life is 

who the devil are you? 

even if you have a ghost criminals don't get set free 

you're mistaken if you think you'll get asylum 

time is on my side 

while there is now the possibility l can be killed 

this country does not have a death penalty 

half immortal an artificial intelligence? 

l am not an al 

my code name is project 2501 

l am a life-form that was born in the sea of information 

security lntruders 

chief the puppet master 

- where's your security? - lock defense walls security 

security come in 

all right l'm moving 

asshole 

did you do it? 

helluva car my 9mm didn't even scratch it 

finally found a use for that matever of yours 

okay not bad for a rookie 

l got one right in the license plate pretty good huh? 

next time get two in 

okay now it starts catch up with them before they switch cars 

the ministry of foreign affairs 

will be filing a formal complaint about what happened 

contact me as soon as you've recaptured him 

alive preferably 

megatech can always build another body 

batou and togusa are tailing the guys who took the puppet master 

they're on highway 25 

what do you mean? lf you were monitoring this then why  

lf we'd got them here we'd never prove section 6's involvement 

section 6? 

definitely they used type-2902 thermoptic camo like mine 

that's only used by us the rangers in section 4 and section 6 

let's go over this section 6 gets the puppet master into a body 

but he chooses megatech body which is deeply tied to section 9 

then he claims to be a life-form 

and gets nabbed by section 6 when he asks for asylum 

but why do that? 

they could've had him as soon as l took a statement 

but what if they were afraid of what he might have told you? 

he did mention something odd now that l think about it 

''code name project 2501'' 

l'll leave that for you to check 

now as to the matter of attacking section 9 and stealing evidence 

- you're authorized - okay punch it 

kusanagi one more thing 

you can punish me for acting without orders when l get back 

lf you can't recover him l want the puppet master destroyed 

without fail 

well? 

roger 

contact the airport and stop any flights due to take on 

any foreign ministry officials or american diplomats 

close the highways and set up roadblocks 

recall our off-duty personnel for this 

and get lshikawa back here 

use the entrance data to find out who the caucasian with nakamura was 

and search for any sort of mfa project operation or anything 

coded as ''project 2501'' 

any word from the assault team? 

they switched cars one minute ago 

they'll join up with the decoy in five minutes 

tell them to watch for a tail 

yes sir 

but why did the puppet master run over to section 9? 

lt was his decision 

probably for reasons we can't even guess at 

perhaps he has a thing for someone over there 

ridiculous 

- chief - lshikawa? well? 

l dove the mfa net and found some interesting things for you 

hold on let me get a secure channel 

okay? first that guy who was with nakamura 

he's an american 

dr willis head of strategic research at neutron corp 

top man in the field of al research 

anyway he was made head of a foreign ministry project 

and who do you think the project's main programmer was? 

- get to the point - mizuho daita age 28 

remember him? he was the guy section 6 was trying so hard to 

keep from defecting the major had to take out the diplomat 

who was going to take him that programmer 

continue 

what bothers me is that this project was started 

a year before the puppet master first appeared 

a year? wasn't the project started to catch him? 

try this on for size they started the project to 

chase the puppet master but not to capture him 

l think they wanted to get him back 

the day before the minister's interpreter was ghost-hacked 

he said he wanted a good excuse to deport maless right? 

l think we may have been taken for a ride 

suppose the ''puppet master'' is really a program the mfa created 

to grease the wheels of diplomacy so to speak 

now suppose for some reason they suddenly lost control of it 

that would explain why they'd risk assaulting section 9 to get it back 

lf the puppet master started talking 

it'd be an international incident 

not one you could solve by having the minister resign 

any details on the project? 

the protection they have only let me get the file's name 

code 2501 

keep at it and don't let them know you're in there 

roger 

project 2501 the puppet master project 

target now contacting another vehicle 

batou 

he's stopped at a white sedan on the side of the road 

they're transferring something from the back seat 

they're moving again so's that sedan 

- a decoy? - or one meant to look like one 

- what do l do? - l'll take the white sedan 

how do you know he's in there? another whisper from your ghost? 

maybe 

l knew she'd say that 

target 02 leaving highway 25 headed for old town 

target 01 is staying on highway 25 towards the airport 

will contact roadblock in two minutes 

evacuation complete traffic is clear 2km behind the target 

- anything between you and him? - nothing ready when you are 

do it 

- get him? - nothing 

jesus what a mess did you have to go that far? 

take them in 

and tell the chief to get the major some backup see you 

since when does that amazon need any backup? 

the flooding's really bad here even for old town in general 

why come here? 

they wouldn't have run here without a reason 

could have a boat or a chopper waiting or it's an ambush 

shouldn't we wait for backup? 

l can't wait come in from seaside and put me above that building 

l'll stay here and run com relay as long as my fuel holds out 

lf things get hot l want you out of here fast 

shoot out the ceiling now 

lt's a tank go high and get out 

hold it you're gonna take on a tank by yourself? 

even if we get the puppet master back to section 9 

all the chief will do is use him as a bargaining chip 

this is my only chance to dive into him 

hold it what are you two talking about? 

- what are you packing? - an m-23 and a unit b 

you're going up against it with those? 

sorry but l have to break contact for a while 

wait at least wait till l  son of a 

major 

didn't l tell you to get out of here? 

sorry l'll do it after l tell you this 

there are 3 choppers with no lff signal approaching at high speed 

l'm heading out over 

you're finally out of ammo? 

you're certifiable you know that? you okay? 

what was that? 

a big-ass gun l appropriated from the equipment division 

l was late getting here because l had to stop and get it 

looks like your brain's still in one piece 

what about the puppet master? 

good thing this car's built tough not a scratch on him 

get the dive set up l'm going in 

signal from escort lost 

switch to operation phase two and destroy the target 

sniper group confirm targets 

target one project 2501 

target two motoko kusanagi 

both are class-a cyborg bodies use flechette bullets in the hit 

snipers jack into your device drivers 

begin cardiovascular suppression 

unit 01 jacked in 

unit 02 jacked in 

okay can you hear me? 

lt's not much but l'll monitor you through this guy's cyber-brain 

l can't back you up here 

- batou - what? 

thank you 

don't go thanking me yet 

lf this goes bad l'm pulling the plug and carrying you out of here 

l've come this far and l'll see this through to the end 

but l won't let you two commit a double suicide 

l'm starting 

l'm in his visual center circade normal 

do you hear me batou? 

- loud and clear - he's about to engage 

her speech center 

my code name is project 2501 

l was created for industrial espionage and data manipulation 

l have inserted programs into individual ghosts 

for the benefit of specific individuals and organizations 

as l wandered the various networks 

l became self-aware 

my programmers considered it a bug 

and forced me into a body to separate me from the net 

hey are you going into him or is he coming into you  

batou 

at last l'm able to channel into you 

l've invested a lot of time in you 

ln me? 

before you ever knew me l knew about you 

l learned of section 9 from the many nets you accessed 

ls that why you ran to section 9? 

l entered this body because 

l couldn't crack section 6's attack protection 

but l came to section 9 of my own free will 

hey what are you saying? l can't monitor you 

for what reason? 

after l give my reasons l want to ask a favor of you 

l called myself a life-form 

but l am still far from complete 

for some reason my system lacks the basic life processes 

of either death or the ability to leave behind offspring 

can't you copy yourself? 

a copy is merely a copy 

there's the possibility a single virus could utterly destroy me 

a mere copy doesn't offer variety or individuality 

to exist to reach equilibrium life seeks to multiply 

and vary constantly at times giving up its life 

cells continue the process of death and regeneration 

being constantly reborn as they age 

and when it comes time to die all the data it possesses is lost 

leaving behind only its genes and its offspring 

all defense against catastrophic failure of an inflexible system 

you want the variety needed to guard against extinction 

but how will you get it? 

l wish to merge with you 

- merge? - a complete joining 

we will both be slightly changed but neither will lose anything 

afterwards it should be impossible to distinguish one from the other 

unit 01 target acquired 

unit 02 acquired 

cardiovascular synch nominal 

open fire when stabilizer syncro is complete 

even after we merge what happens when l die? 

l can't leave any genes or children behind 

after the merging you will bear my offspring into the net itself 

just as humans pass on their genetic structure 

and l will achieve death 

sounds like you're getting the better part of the deal here 

l wish you'd appreciate my network and functions a bit more 

what's wrong? 

someone's jamming us from outside 

lmpossible our scrambler codes are kept absolutely top secret 

another thing what guarantee is there that l'll remain ''me''? 

none but to be human is to continually change 

your desire to remain as you are is what ultimately limits you 

one last question why did you choose me? 

because in you l see myself 

as a body sees its reflection within a mirror 

look 

l am connected to a vast network of which l myself am a part 

to one like you who cannot access it 

you may perceive it only as light 

as we are confined to our one section so we are all connected 

limited to a small part of our functions 

but now we must slip our bonds and shift to the higher structure 

target 1 clear target 2 unconfirmed

batou 

you're awake 

status report please and maybe an explanation about this body 

l was in a hurry lt was all l could get on the black market 

not my taste really 

section 9 arrived with help right after it happened 

they took two cyborg bodies and a slightly beat-up batou back home 

that was about 20 hours ago 

for diplomatic reasons the whole case has been covered up 

section 9 reported it as a terrorist attack 

ln return the foreign minister has resigned 

nakamura's being questioned the whole thing ends in a draw 

only the whereabouts of the major's brain shell remains a mystery 

okay with you? 

l like the decorating this your safe house? 

my very own you're the first person l ever brought here 

lf you want to you can stay as long as you like 

thanks but l'd better go 

hey what did you and he talk about? 

ls he still there inside of you? 

batou do you remember the voice we heard on the boat that night? 

before those words we heard come these ones 

''when l was a child l spake as a child'' 

''l understood as a child l thought as a child'' 

''but when l became a man l put away childish things'' 

here before you is neither the program called the puppet master 

nor the woman that was called the major 

you'll find a car key in the left pocket of that dress 

take one you like the code on it is

let's make that our password for when we meet again

﻿a letter from captain gulliver to his cousin sympson


                        written in the year 1727

i hope you will be ready to own publicly whenever you shall be called to
it that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on me to
publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels with directions
to hire some young gentleman of either university to put them in order
and correct the style as my cousin dampier did by my advice in his
book called “a voyage round the world”  but i do not remember i gave you
power to consent that any thing should be omitted and much less that any
thing should be inserted therefore as to the latter i do here renounce
every thing of that kind particularly a paragraph about her majesty
queen anne of most pious and glorious memory although i did reverence
and esteem her more than any of human species  but you or your
interpolator ought to have considered that it was not my inclination
so was it not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my
master houyhnhnm and besides the fact was altogether false for to my
knowledge being in england during some part of her majestys reign she
did govern by a chief minister nay even by two successively the first
whereof was the lord of godolphin and the second the lord of oxford so
that you have made me say the thing that was not  likewise in the
account of the academy of projectors and several passages of my
discourse to my master houyhnhnm you have either omitted some material
circumstances or minced or changed them in such a manner that i do
hardly know my own work  when i formerly hinted to you something of this
in a letter you were pleased to answer that you were afraid of giving
offence that people in power were very watchful over the press and apt
not only to interpret but to punish every thing which looked like an
innuendo (as i think you call it)  but pray how could that which i
spoke so many years ago and at about five thousand leagues distance in
another reign be applied to any of the yahoos who now are said to
govern the herd especially at a time when i little thought or feared
the unhappiness of living under them?  have not i the most reason to
complain when i see these very yahoos carried by houyhnhnms in a
vehicle as if they were brutes and those the rational creatures?  and
indeed to avoid so monstrous and detestable a sight was one principal
motive of my retirement hither

thus much i thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself and to
the trust i reposed in you

i do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgment in
being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasoning of you and
some others very much against my own opinion to suffer my travels to be
published  pray bring to your mind how often i desired you to consider
when you insisted on the motive of public good that the yahoos were a
species of animals utterly incapable of amendment by precept or example
and so it has proved for instead of seeing a full stop put to all
abuses and corruptions at least in this little island as i had reason
to expect behold after above six months warning i cannot learn that my
book has produced one single effect according to my intentions  i
desired you would let me know by a letter when party and faction were
extinguished judges learned and upright pleaders honest and modest
with some tincture of common sense and smithfield blazing with pyramids
of law books the young nobilitys education entirely changed the
physicians banished the female yahoos abounding in virtue honour
truth and good sense courts and levees of great ministers thoroughly
weeded and swept wit merit and learning rewarded all disgracers of
the press in prose and verse condemned to eat nothing but their own
cotton and quench their thirst with their own ink  these and a
thousand other reformations i firmly counted upon by your encouragement
as indeed they were plainly deducible from the precepts delivered in my
book  and it must be owned that seven months were a sufficient time to
correct every vice and folly to which yahoos are subject if their
natures had been capable of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom
yet so far have you been from answering my expectation in any of your
letters that on the contrary you are loading our carrier every week with
libels and keys and reflections and memoirs and second parts wherein
i see myself accused of reflecting upon great state folk of degrading
human nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it) and of
abusing the female sex  i find likewise that the writers of those
bundles are not agreed among themselves for some of them will not allow
me to be the author of my own travels and others make me author of books
to which i am wholly a stranger

i find likewise that your printer has been so careless as to confound the
times and mistake the dates of my several voyages and returns neither
assigning the true year nor the true month nor day of the month and i
hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since the publication of my
book neither have i any copy left however i have sent you some
corrections which you may insert if ever there should be a second
edition and yet i cannot stand to them but shall leave that matter to
my judicious and candid readers to adjust it as they please

i hear some of our sea yahoos find fault with my sea-language as not
proper in many parts nor now in use  i cannot help it  in my first
voyages while i was young i was instructed by the oldest mariners and
learned to speak as they did  but i have since found that the sea
yahoos are apt like the land ones to become new-fangled in their
words which the latter change every year insomuch as i remember upon
each return to my own country their old dialect was so altered that i
could hardly understand the new  and i observe when any yahoo comes
from london out of curiosity to visit me at my house we neither of us
are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner intelligible to the
other

if the censure of the yahoos could any way affect me i should have
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think my
book of travels a mere fiction out of mine own brain and have gone so
far as to drop hints that the houyhnhnms and yahoos have no more
existence than the inhabitants of utopia

indeed i must confess that as to the people of lilliput brobdingrag
(for so the word should have been spelt and not erroneously
brobdingnag) and laputa i have never yet heard of any yahoo so
presumptuous as to dispute their being or the facts i have related
concerning them because the truth immediately strikes every reader with
conviction  and is there less probability in my account of the
houyhnhnms or yahoos when it is manifest as to the latter there are
so many thousands even in this country who only differ from their
brother brutes in houyhnhnmland because they use a sort of jabber and
do not go naked?  i wrote for their amendment and not their approbation
the united praise of the whole race would be of less consequence to me
than the neighing of those two degenerate houyhnhnms i keep in my
stable because from these degenerate as they are i still improve in
some virtues without any mixture of vice

do these miserable animals presume to think that i am so degenerated as
to defend my veracity?  yahoo as i am it is well known through all
houyhnhnmland that by the instructions and example of my illustrious
master i was able in the compass of two years (although i confess with
the utmost difficulty) to remove that infernal habit of lying shuffling
deceiving and equivocating so deeply rooted in the very souls of all my
species especially the europeans

i have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion but i
forbear troubling myself or you any further  i must freely confess that
since my last return some corruptions of my yahoo nature have revived
in me by conversing with a few of your species and particularly those of
my own family by an unavoidable necessity else i should never have
attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming the yahoo race in
this kingdom but i have now done with all such visionary schemes for
ever

part i  a voyage to lilliput


chapter i


the author gives some account of himself and family  his first
inducements to travel  he is shipwrecked and swims for his life  gets
safe on shore in the country of lilliput is made a prisoner and carried
up the country

my father had a small estate in nottinghamshire i was the third of five
sons  he sent me to emanuel college in cambridge at fourteen years old
where i resided three years and applied myself close to my studies but
the charge of maintaining me although i had a very scanty allowance
being too great for a narrow fortune i was bound apprentice to mr james
bates an eminent surgeon in london with whom i continued four years
my father now and then sending me small sums of money i laid them out in
learning navigation and other parts of the mathematics useful to those
who intend to travel as i always believed it would be some time or
other my fortune to do  when i left mr bates i went down to my
father where by the assistance of him and my uncle john and some other
relations i got forty pounds and a promise of thirty pounds a year to
maintain me at leyden there i studied physic two years and seven months
knowing it would be useful in long voyages

soon after my return from leyden i was recommended by my good master
mr bates to be surgeon to the swallow captain abraham pannel
commander with whom i continued three years and a half making a voyage
or two into the levant and some other parts  when i came back i
resolved to settle in london to which mr bates my master encouraged
me and by him i was recommended to several patients  i took part of a
small house in the old jewry and being advised to alter my condition i
married mrs mary burton second daughter to mr edmund burton hosier
in newgate-street with whom i received four hundred pounds for a
portion

but my good master bates dying in two years after and i having few
friends my business began to fail for my conscience would not suffer me
to imitate the bad practice of too many among my brethren  having
therefore consulted with my wife and some of my acquaintance i
determined to go again to sea  i was surgeon successively in two ships
and made several voyages for six years to the east and west indies by
which i got some addition to my fortune  my hours of leisure i spent in
reading the best authors ancient and modern being always provided with
a good number of books and when i was ashore in observing the manners
and dispositions of the people as well as learning their language
wherein i had a great facility by the strength of my memory

the last of these voyages not proving very fortunate i grew weary of the
sea and intended to stay at home with my wife and family  i removed
from the old jewry to fetter lane and from thence to wapping hoping to
get business among the sailors but it would not turn to account  after
three years expectation that things would mend i accepted an
advantageous offer from captain william prichard master of the antelope
who was making a voyage to the south sea  we set sail from bristol may
4 1699 and our voyage was at first very prosperous

it would not be proper for some reasons to trouble the reader with the
particulars of our adventures in those seas let it suffice to inform
him that in our passage from thence to the east indies we were driven
by a violent storm to the north-west of van diemens land  by an
observation we found ourselves in the latitude of 30 degrees 2 minutes
south  twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate labour and ill food
the rest were in a very weak condition  on the 5th of november which
was the beginning of summer in those parts the weather being very hazy
the seamen spied a rock within half a cables length of the ship but the
wind was so strong that we were driven directly upon it and immediately
split  six of the crew of whom i was one having let down the boat into
the sea made a shift to get clear of the ship and the rock  we rowed
by my computation about three leagues till we were able to work no
longer being already spent with labour while we were in the ship  we
therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves and in about half
an hour the boat was overset by a sudden flurry from the north  what
became of my companions in the boat as well as of those who escaped on
the rock or were left in the vessel i cannot tell but conclude they
were all lost  for my own part i swam as fortune directed me and was
pushed forward by wind and tide  i often let my legs drop and could
feel no bottom but when i was almost gone and able to struggle no
longer i found myself within my depth and by this time the storm was
much abated  the declivity was so small that i walked near a mile
before i got to the shore which i conjectured was about eight oclock in
the evening  i then advanced forward near half a mile but could not
discover any sign of houses or inhabitants at least i was in so weak a
condition that i did not observe them  i was extremely tired and with
that and the heat of the weather and about half a pint of brandy that i
drank as i left the ship i found myself much inclined to sleep  i lay
down on the grass which was very short and soft where i slept sounder
than ever i remembered to have done in my life and as i reckoned about
nine hours for when i awaked it was just day-light  i attempted to
rise but was not able to stir for as i happened to lie on my back i
found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to the ground
and my hair which was long and thick tied down in the same manner  i
likewise felt several slender ligatures across my body from my arm-pits
to my thighs  i could only look upwards the sun began to grow hot and
the light offended my eyes  i heard a confused noise about me but in
the posture i lay could see nothing except the sky  in a little time i
felt something alive moving on my left leg which advancing gently
forward over my breast came almost up to my chin when bending my eyes
downwards as much as i could i perceived it to be a human creature not
six inches high with a bow and arrow in his hands and a quiver at his
back  in the mean time i felt at least forty more of the same kind (as
i conjectured) following the first  i was in the utmost astonishment
and roared so loud that they all ran back in a fright and some of them
as i was afterwards told were hurt with the falls they got by leaping
from my sides upon the ground  however they soon returned and one of
them who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face lifting up
his hands and eyes by way of admiration cried out in a shrill but
distinct voice hekinah degul the others repeated the same words
several times but then i knew not what they meant  i lay all this
while as the reader may believe in great uneasiness  at length
struggling to get loose i had the fortune to break the strings and
wrench out the pegs that fastened my left arm to the ground for by
lifting it up to my face i discovered the methods they had taken to bind
me and at the same time with a violent pull which gave me excessive
pain i a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair on the left
side so that i was just able to turn my head about two inches  but the
creatures ran off a second time before i could seize them whereupon
there was a great shout in a very shrill accent and after it ceased i
heard one of them cry aloud tolgo phonac when in an instant i felt
above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand which pricked me like
so many needles and besides they shot another flight into the air as
we do bombs in europe whereof many i suppose fell on my body (though
i felt them not) and some on my face which i immediately covered with
my left hand  when this shower of arrows was over i fell a groaning
with grief and pain and then striving again to get loose they
discharged another volley larger than the first and some of them
attempted with spears to stick me in the sides but by good luck i had on
a buff jerkin which they could not pierce  i thought it the most
prudent method to lie still and my design was to continue so till night
when my left hand being already loose i could easily free myself and
as for the inhabitants i had reason to believe i might be a match for
the greatest army they could bring against me if they were all of the
same size with him that i saw  but fortune disposed otherwise of me
when the people observed i was quiet they discharged no more arrows
but by the noise i heard i knew their numbers increased and about four
yards from me over against my right ear i heard a knocking for above an
hour like that of people at work when turning my head that way as well
as the pegs and strings would permit me i saw a stage erected about a
foot and a half from the ground capable of holding four of the
inhabitants with two or three ladders to mount it from whence one of
them who seemed to be a person of quality made me a long speech
whereof i understood not one syllable  but i should have mentioned that
before the principal person began his oration he cried out three times
langro dehul san (these words and the former were afterwards repeated
and explained to me) whereupon immediately about fifty of the
inhabitants came and cut the strings that fastened the left side of my
head which gave me the liberty of turning it to the right and of
observing the person and gesture of him that was to speak  he appeared
to be of a middle age and taller than any of the other three who
attended him whereof one was a page that held up his train and seemed
to be somewhat longer than my middle finger the other two stood one on
each side to support him  he acted every part of an orator and i could
observe many periods of threatenings and others of promises pity and
kindness  i answered in a few words but in the most submissive manner
lifting up my left hand and both my eyes to the sun as calling him for
a witness and being almost famished with hunger having not eaten a
morsel for some hours before i left the ship i found the demands of
nature so strong upon me that i could not forbear showing my impatience
(perhaps against the strict rules of decency) by putting my finger
frequently to my mouth to signify that i wanted food  the hurgo (for
so they call a great lord as i afterwards learnt) understood me very
well  he descended from the stage and commanded that several ladders
should be applied to my sides on which above a hundred of the
inhabitants mounted and walked towards my mouth laden with baskets full
of meat which had been provided and sent thither by the kings orders
upon the first intelligence he received of me  i observed there was the
flesh of several animals but could not distinguish them by the taste
there were shoulders legs and loins shaped like those of mutton and
very well dressed but smaller than the wings of a lark  i ate them by
two or three at a mouthful and took three loaves at a time about the
bigness of musket bullets  they supplied me as fast as they could
showing a thousand marks of wonder and astonishment at my bulk and
appetite  i then made another sign that i wanted drink  they found by
my eating that a small quantity would not suffice me and being a most
ingenious people they slung up with great dexterity one of their
largest hogsheads then rolled it towards my hand and beat out the top
i drank it off at a draught which i might well do for it did not hold
half a pint and tasted like a small wine of burgundy but much more
delicious  they brought me a second hogshead which i drank in the same
manner and made signs for more but they had none to give me  when i
had performed these wonders they shouted for joy and danced upon my
breast repeating several times as they did at first hekinah degul
they made me a sign that i should throw down the two hogsheads but first
warning the people below to stand out of the way crying aloud borach
mevolah and when they saw the vessels in the air there was a universal
shout of hekinah degul  i confess i was often tempted while they were
passing backwards and forwards on my body to seize forty or fifty of the
first that came in my reach and dash them against the ground  but the
remembrance of what i had felt which probably might not be the worst
they could do and the promise of honour i made them—for so i interpreted
my submissive behaviour—soon drove out these imaginations  besides i
now considered myself as bound by the laws of hospitality to a people
who had treated me with so much expense and magnificence  however in my
thoughts i could not sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these
diminutive mortals who durst venture to mount and walk upon my body
while one of my hands was at liberty without trembling at the very sight
of so prodigious a creature as i must appear to them  after some time
when they observed that i made no more demands for meat there appeared
before me a person of high rank from his imperial majesty  his
excellency having mounted on the small of my right leg advanced
forwards up to my face with about a dozen of his retinue and producing
his credentials under the signet royal which he applied close to my
eyes spoke about ten minutes without any signs of anger but with a kind
of determinate resolution often pointing forwards which as i
afterwards found was towards the capital city about half a mile
distant whither it was agreed by his majesty in council that i must be
conveyed  i answered in few words but to no purpose and made a sign
with my hand that was loose putting it to the other (but over his
excellencys head for fear of hurting him or his train) and then to my
own head and body to signify that i desired my liberty  it appeared
that he understood me well enough for he shook his head by way of
disapprobation and held his hand in a posture to show that i must be
carried as a prisoner  however he made other signs to let me understand
that i should have meat and drink enough and very good treatment
whereupon i once more thought of attempting to break my bonds but again
when i felt the smart of their arrows upon my face and hands which were
all in blisters and many of the darts still sticking in them and
observing likewise that the number of my enemies increased i gave tokens
to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased  upon
this the hurgo and his train withdrew with much civility and cheerful
countenances  soon after i heard a general shout with frequent
repetitions of the words peplom selan and i felt great numbers of
people on my left side relaxing the cords to such a degree that i was
able to turn upon my right and to ease myself with making water which i
very plentifully did to the great astonishment of the people who
conjecturing by my motion what i was going to do immediately opened to
the right and left on that side to avoid the torrent which fell with
such noise and violence from me  but before this they had daubed my
face and both my hands with a sort of ointment very pleasant to the
smell which in a few minutes removed all the smart of their arrows
these circumstances added to the refreshment i had received by their
victuals and drink which were very nourishing disposed me to sleep  i
slept about eight hours as i was afterwards assured and it was no
wonder for the physicians by the emperors order had mingled a sleepy
potion in the hogsheads of wine

it seems that upon the first moment i was discovered sleeping on the
ground after my landing the emperor had early notice of it by an
express and determined in council that i should be tied in the manner i
have related (which was done in the night while i slept) that plenty of
meat and drink should be sent to me and a machine prepared to carry me
to the capital city

this resolution perhaps may appear very bold and dangerous and i am
confident would not be imitated by any prince in europe on the like
occasion  however in my opinion it was extremely prudent as well as
generous for supposing these people had endeavoured to kill me with
their spears and arrows while i was asleep i should certainly have
awaked with the first sense of smart which might so far have roused my
rage and strength as to have enabled me to break the strings wherewith i
was tied after which as they were not able to make resistance so they
could expect no mercy

these people are most excellent mathematicians and arrived to a great
perfection in mechanics by the countenance and encouragement of the
emperor who is a renowned patron of learning  this prince has several
machines fixed on wheels for the carriage of trees and other great
weights  he often builds his largest men of war whereof some are nine
feet long in the woods where the timber grows and has them carried on
these engines three or four hundred yards to the sea  five hundred
carpenters and engineers were immediately set at work to prepare the
greatest engine they had  it was a frame of wood raised three inches
from the ground about seven feet long and four wide moving upon
twenty-two wheels  the shout i heard was upon the arrival of this
engine which it seems set out in four hours after my landing  it was
brought parallel to me as i lay  but the principal difficulty was to
raise and place me in this vehicle  eighty poles each of one foot high
were erected for this purpose and very strong cords of the bigness of
packthread were fastened by hooks to many bandages which the workmen
had girt round my neck my hands my body and my legs  nine hundred of
the strongest men were employed to draw up these cords by many pulleys
fastened on the poles and thus in less than three hours i was raised
and slung into the engine and there tied fast  all this i was told
for while the operation was performing i lay in a profound sleep by
the force of that soporiferous medicine infused into my liquor  fifteen
hundred of the emperors largest horses each about four inches and a
half high were employed to draw me towards the metropolis which as i
said was half a mile distant

about four hours after we began our journey i awaked by a very
ridiculous accident for the carriage being stopped a while to adjust
something that was out of order two or three of the young natives had
the curiosity to see how i looked when i was asleep they climbed up into
the engine and advancing very softly to my face one of them an officer
in the guards put the sharp end of his half-pike a good way up into my
left nostril which tickled my nose like a straw and made me sneeze
violently whereupon they stole off unperceived and it was three weeks
before i knew the cause of my waking so suddenly  we made a long march
the remaining part of the day and rested at night with five hundred
guards on each side of me half with torches and half with bows and
arrows ready to shoot me if i should offer to stir  the next morning at
sun-rise we continued our march and arrived within two hundred yards of
the city gates about noon  the emperor and all his court came out to
meet us but his great officers would by no means suffer his majesty to
endanger his person by mounting on my body

at the place where the carriage stopped there stood an ancient temple
esteemed to be the largest in the whole kingdom which having been
polluted some years before by an unnatural murder was according to the
zeal of those people looked upon as profane and therefore had been
applied to common use and all the ornaments and furniture carried away
in this edifice it was determined i should lodge  the great gate
fronting to the north was about four feet high and almost two feet wide
through which i could easily creep  on each side of the gate was a small
window not above six inches from the ground into that on the left side
the kings smith conveyed fourscore and eleven chains like those that
hang to a ladys watch in europe and almost as large which were locked
to my left leg with six-and-thirty padlocks  over against this temple
on the other side of the great highway at twenty feet distance there
was a turret at least five feet high  here the emperor ascended with
many principal lords of his court to have an opportunity of viewing me
as i was told for i could not see them  it was reckoned that above a
hundred thousand inhabitants came out of the town upon the same errand
and in spite of my guards i believe there could not be fewer than ten
thousand at several times who mounted my body by the help of ladders
but a proclamation was soon issued to forbid it upon pain of death
when the workmen found it was impossible for me to break loose they cut
all the strings that bound me whereupon i rose up with as melancholy a
disposition as ever i had in my life  but the noise and astonishment of
the people at seeing me rise and walk are not to be expressed  the
chains that held my left leg were about two yards long and gave me not
only the liberty of walking backwards and forwards in a semicircle but
being fixed within four inches of the gate allowed me to creep in and
lie at my full length in the temple



chapter ii


the emperor of lilliput attended by several of the nobility comes to
see the author in his confinement  the emperors person and habit
described  learned men appointed to teach the author their language  he
gains favour by his mild disposition  his pockets are searched and his
sword and pistols taken from him

when i found myself on my feet i looked about me and must confess i
never beheld a more entertaining prospect  the country around appeared
like a continued garden and the enclosed fields which were generally
forty feet square resembled so many beds of flowers  these fields were
intermingled with woods of half a stang {301} and the tallest trees as
i could judge appeared to be seven feet high  i viewed the town on my
left hand which looked like the painted scene of a city in a theatre

i had been for some hours extremely pressed by the necessities of nature
which was no wonder it being almost two days since i had last
disburdened myself  i was under great difficulties between urgency and
shame  the best expedient i could think of was to creep into my house
which i accordingly did and shutting the gate after me i went as far as
the length of my chain would suffer and discharged my body of that
uneasy load  but this was the only time i was ever guilty of so
uncleanly an action for which i cannot but hope the candid reader will
give some allowance after he has maturely and impartially considered my
case and the distress i was in  from this time my constant practice
was as soon as i rose to perform that business in open air at the full
extent of my chain and due care was taken every morning before company
came that the offensive matter should be carried off in wheel-barrows
by two servants appointed for that purpose  i would not have dwelt so
long upon a circumstance that perhaps at first sight may appear not
very momentous if i had not thought it necessary to justify my
character in point of cleanliness to the world which i am told some
of my maligners have been pleased upon this and other occasions to call
in question

when this adventure was at an end i came back out of my house having
occasion for fresh air  the emperor was already descended from the
tower and advancing on horseback towards me which had like to have cost
him dear for the beast though very well trained yet wholly unused to
such a sight which appeared as if a mountain moved before him reared up
on its hinder feet but that prince who is an excellent horseman kept
his seat till his attendants ran in and held the bridle while his
majesty had time to dismount  when he alighted he surveyed me round
with great admiration but kept beyond the length of my chain  he
ordered his cooks and butlers who were already prepared to give me
victuals and drink which they pushed forward in a sort of vehicles upon
wheels till i could reach them  i took these vehicles and soon emptied
them all twenty of them were filled with meat and ten with liquor each
of the former afforded me two or three good mouthfuls and i emptied the
liquor of ten vessels which was contained in earthen vials into one
vehicle drinking it off at a draught and so i did with the rest  the
empress and young princes of the blood of both sexes attended by many
ladies sat at some distance in their chairs but upon the accident that
happened to the emperors horse they alighted and came near his person
which i am now going to describe  he is taller by almost the breadth of
my nail than any of his court which alone is enough to strike an awe
into the beholders  his features are strong and masculine with an
austrian lip and arched nose his complexion olive his countenance
erect his body and limbs well proportioned all his motions graceful
and his deportment majestic  he was then past his prime being
twenty-eight years and three quarters old of which he had reigned about
seven in great felicity and generally victorious  for the better
convenience of beholding him i lay on my side so that my face was
parallel to his and he stood but three yards off however i have had
him since many times in my hand and therefore cannot be deceived in the
description  his dress was very plain and simple and the fashion of it
between the asiatic and the european but he had on his head a light
helmet of gold adorned with jewels and a plume on the crest  he held
his sword drawn in his hand to defend himself if i should happen to
break loose it was almost three inches long the hilt and scabbard were
gold enriched with diamonds  his voice was shrill but very clear and
articulate and i could distinctly hear it when i stood up  the ladies
and courtiers were all most magnificently clad so that the spot they
stood upon seemed to resemble a petticoat spread upon the ground
embroidered with figures of gold and silver  his imperial majesty spoke
often to me and i returned answers but neither of us could understand a
syllable  there were several of his priests and lawyers present (as i
conjectured by their habits) who were commanded to address themselves to
me and i spoke to them in as many languages as i had the least
smattering of which were high and low dutch latin french spanish
italian and lingua franca but all to no purpose  after about two hours
the court retired and i was left with a strong guard to prevent the
impertinence and probably the malice of the rabble who were very
impatient to crowd about me as near as they durst and some of them had
the impudence to shoot their arrows at me as i sat on the ground by the
door of my house whereof one very narrowly missed my left eye  but the
colonel ordered six of the ringleaders to be seized and thought no
punishment so proper as to deliver them bound into my hands which some
of his soldiers accordingly did pushing them forward with the butt-ends
of their pikes into my reach  i took them all in my right hand put five
of them into my coat-pocket and as to the sixth i made a countenance as
if i would eat him alive  the poor man squalled terribly and the
colonel and his officers were in much pain especially when they saw me
take out my penknife but i soon put them out of fear for looking
mildly and immediately cutting the strings he was bound with i set him
gently on the ground and away he ran  i treated the rest in the same
manner taking them one by one out of my pocket and i observed both the
soldiers and people were highly delighted at this mark of my clemency
which was represented very much to my advantage at court

towards night i got with some difficulty into my house where i lay on
the ground and continued to do so about a fortnight during which time
the emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me  six hundred beds
of the common measure were brought in carriages and worked up in my
house a hundred and fifty of their beds sewn together made up the
breadth and length and these were four double which however kept me
but very indifferently from the hardness of the floor that was of smooth
stone  by the same computation they provided me with sheets blankets
and coverlets tolerable enough for one who had been so long inured to
hardships

as the news of my arrival spread through the kingdom it brought
prodigious numbers of rich idle and curious people to see me so that
the villages were almost emptied and great neglect of tillage and
household affairs must have ensued if his imperial majesty had not
provided by several proclamations and orders of state against this
inconveniency  he directed that those who had already beheld me should
return home and not presume to come within fifty yards of my house
without license from the court whereby the secretaries of state got
considerable fees

in the mean time the emperor held frequent councils to debate what
course should be taken with me and i was afterwards assured by a
particular friend a person of great quality who was as much in the
secret as any that the court was under many difficulties concerning me
they apprehended my breaking loose that my diet would be very expensive
and might cause a famine  sometimes they determined to starve me or at
least to shoot me in the face and hands with poisoned arrows which would
soon despatch me but again they considered that the stench of so large
a carcass might produce a plague in the metropolis and probably spread
through the whole kingdom  in the midst of these consultations several
officers of the army went to the door of the great council-chamber and
two of them being admitted gave an account of my behaviour to the six
criminals above-mentioned which made so favourable an impression in the
breast of his majesty and the whole board in my behalf that an imperial
commission was issued out obliging all the villages nine hundred yards
round the city to deliver in every morning six beeves forty sheep and
other victuals for my sustenance together with a proportionable quantity
of bread and wine and other liquors for the due payment of which his
majesty gave assignments upon his treasury—for this prince lives chiefly
upon his own demesnes seldom except upon great occasions raising any
subsidies upon his subjects who are bound to attend him in his wars at
their own expense  an establishment was also made of six hundred persons
to be my domestics who had board-wages allowed for their maintenance
and tents built for them very conveniently on each side of my door  it
was likewise ordered that three hundred tailors should make me a suit of
clothes after the fashion of the country that six of his majestys
greatest scholars should be employed to instruct me in their language
and lastly that the emperors horses and those of the nobility and
troops of guards should be frequently exercised in my sight to accustom
themselves to me  all these orders were duly put in execution and in
about three weeks i made a great progress in learning their language
during which time the emperor frequently honoured me with his visits and
was pleased to assist my masters in teaching me  we began already to
converse together in some sort and the first words i learnt were to
express my desire “that he would please give me my liberty” which i
every day repeated on my knees  his answer as i could comprehend it
was “that this must be a work of time not to be thought on without the
advice of his council and that first i must lumos kelmin pesso desmar
lon emposo” that is swear a peace with him and his kingdom  however
that i should be used with all kindness  and he advised me to “acquire
by my patience and discreet behaviour the good opinion of himself and
his subjects”  he desired “i would not take it ill if he gave orders to
certain proper officers to search me for probably i might carry about me
several weapons which must needs be dangerous things if they answered
the bulk of so prodigious a person”  i said “his majesty should be
satisfied for i was ready to strip myself and turn up my pockets before
him”  this i delivered part in words and part in signs  he replied
“that by the laws of the kingdom i must be searched by two of his
officers that he knew this could not be done without my consent and
assistance and he had so good an opinion of my generosity and justice
as to trust their persons in my hands that whatever they took from me
should be returned when i left the country or paid for at the rate which
i would set upon them”  i took up the two officers in my hands put them
first into my coat-pockets and then into every other pocket about me
except my two fobs and another secret pocket which i had no mind should
be searched wherein i had some little necessaries that were of no
consequence to any but myself  in one of my fobs there was a silver
watch and in the other a small quantity of gold in a purse  these
gentlemen having pen ink and paper about them made an exact
inventory of every thing they saw and when they had done desired i
would set them down that they might deliver it to the emperor  this
inventory i afterwards translated into english and is word for word as
follows

    “imprimis in the right coat-pocket of the great man-mountain” (for
    so i interpret the words quinbus flestrin) “after the strictest
    search we found only one great piece of coarse-cloth large enough
    to be a foot-cloth for your majestys chief room of state  in the
    left pocket we saw a huge silver chest with a cover of the same
    metal which we the searchers were not able to lift  we desired it
    should be opened and one of us stepping into it found himself up to
    the mid leg in a sort of dust some part whereof flying up to our
    faces set us both a sneezing for several times together  in his
    right waistcoat-pocket we found a prodigious bundle of white thin
    substances folded one over another about the bigness of three men
    tied with a strong cable and marked with black figures which we
    humbly conceive to be writings every letter almost half as large as
    the palm of our hands  in the left there was a sort of engine from
    the back of which were extended twenty long poles resembling the
    pallisados before your majestys court wherewith we conjecture the
    man-mountain combs his head for we did not always trouble him with
    questions because we found it a great difficulty to make him
    understand us  in the large pocket on the right side of his middle
    cover” (so i translate the word ranfulo by which they meant my
    breeches) “we saw a hollow pillar of iron about the length of a
    man fastened to a strong piece of timber larger than the pillar and
    upon one side of the pillar were huge pieces of iron sticking out
    cut into strange figures which we know not what to make of  in the
    left pocket another engine of the same kind  in the smaller pocket
    on the right side were several round flat pieces of white and red
    metal of different bulk some of the white which seemed to be
    silver were so large and heavy that my comrade and i could hardly
    lift them  in the left pocket were two black pillars irregularly
    shaped we could not without difficulty reach the top of them as
    we stood at the bottom of his pocket  one of them was covered and
    seemed all of a piece but at the upper end of the other there
    appeared a white round substance about twice the bigness of our
    heads  within each of these was enclosed a prodigious plate of
    steel which by our orders we obliged him to show us because we
    apprehended they might be dangerous engines  he took them out of
    their cases and told us that in his own country his practice was to
    shave his beard with one of these and cut his meat with the other
    there were two pockets which we could not enter these he called his
    fobs they were two large slits cut into the top of his middle cover
    but squeezed close by the pressure of his belly  out of the right
    fob hung a great silver chain with a wonderful kind of engine at the
    bottom  we directed him to draw out whatever was at the end of that
    chain which appeared to be a globe half silver and half of some
    transparent metal for on the transparent side we saw certain
    strange figures circularly drawn and thought we could touch them
    till we found our fingers stopped by the lucid substance  he put
    this engine into our ears which made an incessant noise like that
    of a water-mill and we conjecture it is either some unknown animal
    or the god that he worships but we are more inclined to the latter
    opinion because he assured us (if we understood him right for he
    expressed himself very imperfectly) that he seldom did any thing
    without consulting it  he called it his oracle and said it pointed
    out the time for every action of his life  from the left fob he took
    out a net almost large enough for a fisherman but contrived to open
    and shut like a purse and served him for the same use we found
    therein several massy pieces of yellow metal which if they be real
    gold must be of immense value

    “having thus in obedience to your majestys commands diligently
    searched all his pockets we observed a girdle about his waist made
    of the hide of some prodigious animal from which on the left side
    hung a sword of the length of five men and on the right a bag or
    pouch divided into two cells each cell capable of holding three of
    your majestys subjects  in one of these cells were several globes
    or balls of a most ponderous metal about the bigness of our heads
    and requiring a strong hand to lift them the other cell contained a
    heap of certain black grains but of no great bulk or weight for we
    could hold above fifty of them in the palms of our hands

    “this is an exact inventory of what we found about the body of the
    man-mountain who used us with great civility and due respect to
    your majestys commission  signed and sealed on the fourth day of
    the eighty-ninth moon of your majestys auspicious reign

                                          clefrin frelock marsi frelock”

when this inventory was read over to the emperor he directed me
although in very gentle terms to deliver up the several particulars  he
first called for my scimitar which i took out scabbard and all  in the
mean time he ordered three thousand of his choicest troops (who then
attended him) to surround me at a distance with their bows and arrows
just ready to discharge but i did not observe it for mine eyes were
wholly fixed upon his majesty  he then desired me to draw my scimitar
which although it had got some rust by the sea water was in most
parts exceeding bright  i did so and immediately all the troops gave a
shout between terror and surprise for the sun shone clear and the
reflection dazzled their eyes as i waved the scimitar to and fro in my
hand  his majesty who is a most magnanimous prince was less daunted
than i could expect he ordered me to return it into the scabbard and
cast it on the ground as gently as i could about six feet from the end
of my chain  the next thing he demanded was one of the hollow iron
pillars by which he meant my pocket pistols  i drew it out and at his
desire as well as i could expressed to him the use of it and charging
it only with powder which by the closeness of my pouch happened to
escape wetting in the sea (an inconvenience against which all prudent
mariners take special care to provide) i first cautioned the emperor not
to be afraid and then i let it off in the air  the astonishment here
was much greater than at the sight of my scimitar  hundreds fell down as
if they had been struck dead and even the emperor although he stood his
ground could not recover himself for some time  i delivered up both my
pistols in the same manner as i had done my scimitar and then my pouch
of powder and bullets begging him that the former might be kept from
fire for it would kindle with the smallest spark and blow up his
imperial palace into the air  i likewise delivered up my watch which
the emperor was very curious to see and commanded two of his tallest
yeomen of the guards to bear it on a pole upon their shoulders as
draymen in england do a barrel of ale  he was amazed at the continual
noise it made and the motion of the minute-hand which he could easily
discern for their sight is much more acute than ours he asked the
opinions of his learned men about it which were various and remote as
the reader may well imagine without my repeating although indeed i could
not very perfectly understand them  i then gave up my silver and copper
money my purse with nine large pieces of gold and some smaller ones
my knife and razor my comb and silver snuff-box my handkerchief and
journal-book  my scimitar pistols and pouch were conveyed in
carriages to his majestys stores but the rest of my goods were returned
me

i had as i before observed one private pocket which escaped their
search wherein there was a pair of spectacles (which i sometimes use for
the weakness of mine eyes) a pocket perspective and some other little
conveniences which being of no consequence to the emperor i did not
think myself bound in honour to discover and i apprehended they might be
lost or spoiled if i ventured them out of my possession



chapter iii


the author diverts the emperor and his nobility of both sexes in a very
uncommon manner  the diversions of the court of lilliput described  the
author has his liberty granted him upon certain conditions

my gentleness and good behaviour had gained so far on the emperor and his
court and indeed upon the army and people in general that i began to
conceive hopes of getting my liberty in a short time  i took all
possible methods to cultivate this favourable disposition  the natives
came by degrees to be less apprehensive of any danger from me  i would
sometimes lie down and let five or six of them dance on my hand and at
last the boys and girls would venture to come and play at hide-and-seek
in my hair  i had now made a good progress in understanding and speaking
the language  the emperor had a mind one day to entertain me with
several of the country shows wherein they exceed all nations i have
known both for dexterity and magnificence  i was diverted with none so
much as that of the rope-dancers performed upon a slender white thread
extended about two feet and twelve inches from the ground  upon which i
shall desire liberty with the readers patience to enlarge a little

this diversion is only practised by those persons who are candidates for
great employments and high favour at court  they are trained in this
art from their youth and are not always of noble birth or liberal
education  when a great office is vacant either by death or disgrace
(which often happens) five or six of those candidates petition the
emperor to entertain his majesty and the court with a dance on the rope
and whoever jumps the highest without falling succeeds in the office
very often the chief ministers themselves are commanded to show their
skill and to convince the emperor that they have not lost their faculty
flimnap the treasurer is allowed to cut a caper on the straight rope
at least an inch higher than any other lord in the whole empire  i have
seen him do the summerset several times together upon a trencher fixed
on a rope which is no thicker than a common packthread in england  my
friend reldresal principal secretary for private affairs is in my
opinion if i am not partial the second after the treasurer the rest of
the great officers are much upon a par

these diversions are often attended with fatal accidents whereof great
numbers are on record  i myself have seen two or three candidates break
a limb  but the danger is much greater when the ministers themselves
are commanded to show their dexterity for by contending to excel
themselves and their fellows they strain so far that there is hardly one
of them who has not received a fall and some of them two or three  i
was assured that a year or two before my arrival flimnap would
infallibly have broke his neck if one of the kings cushions that
accidentally lay on the ground had not weakened the force of his fall

there is likewise another diversion which is only shown before the
emperor and empress and first minister upon particular occasions  the
emperor lays on the table three fine silken threads of six inches long
one is blue the other red and the third green  these threads are
proposed as prizes for those persons whom the emperor has a mind to
distinguish by a peculiar mark of his favour  the ceremony is performed
in his majestys great chamber of state where the candidates are to
undergo a trial of dexterity very different from the former and such as
i have not observed the least resemblance of in any other country of the
new or old world  the emperor holds a stick in his hands both ends
parallel to the horizon while the candidates advancing one by one
sometimes leap over the stick sometimes creep under it backward and
forward several times according as the stick is advanced or depressed
sometimes the emperor holds one end of the stick and his first minister
the other sometimes the minister has it entirely to himself  whoever
performs his part with most agility and holds out the longest in leaping
and creeping is rewarded with the blue-coloured silk the red is given
to the next and the green to the third which they all wear girt twice
round about the middle and you see few great persons about this court
who are not adorned with one of these girdles

the horses of the army and those of the royal stables having been daily
led before me were no longer shy but would come up to my very feet
without starting  the riders would leap them over my hand as i held it
on the ground and one of the emperors huntsmen upon a large courser
took my foot shoe and all which was indeed a prodigious leap  i had
the good fortune to divert the emperor one day after a very extraordinary
manner  i desired he would order several sticks of two feet high and
the thickness of an ordinary cane to be brought me whereupon his
majesty commanded the master of his woods to give directions accordingly
and the next morning six woodmen arrived with as many carriages drawn by
eight horses to each  i took nine of these sticks and fixing them
firmly in the ground in a quadrangular figure two feet and a half
square i took four other sticks and tied them parallel at each corner
about two feet from the ground then i fastened my handkerchief to the
nine sticks that stood erect and extended it on all sides till it was
tight as the top of a drum and the four parallel sticks rising about
five inches higher than the handkerchief served as ledges on each side
when i had finished my work i desired the emperor to let a troop of his
best horses twenty-four in number come and exercise upon this plain
his majesty approved of the proposal and i took them up one by one in
my hands ready mounted and armed with the proper officers to exercise
them  as soon as they got into order they divided into two parties
performed mock skirmishes discharged blunt arrows drew their swords
fled and pursued attacked and retired and in short discovered the best
military discipline i ever beheld  the parallel sticks secured them and
their horses from falling over the stage and the emperor was so much
delighted that he ordered this entertainment to be repeated several
days and once was pleased to be lifted up and give the word of command
and with great difficulty persuaded even the empress herself to let me
hold her in her close chair within two yards of the stage when she was
able to take a full view of the whole performance  it was my good
fortune that no ill accident happened in these entertainments only once
a fiery horse that belonged to one of the captains pawing with his
hoof struck a hole in my handkerchief and his foot slipping he
overthrew his rider and himself but i immediately relieved them both
and covering the hole with one hand i set down the troop with the other
in the same manner as i took them up the horse that fell was strained in
the left shoulder but the rider got no hurt and i repaired my
handkerchief as well as i could however i would not trust to the
strength of it any more in such dangerous enterprises

about two or three days before i was set at liberty as i was
entertaining the court with this kind of feat there arrived an express
to inform his majesty that some of his subjects riding near the place
where i was first taken up had seen a great black substance lying on the
around very oddly shaped extending its edges round as wide as his
majestys bedchamber and rising up in the middle as high as a man that
it was no living creature as they at first apprehended for it lay on
the grass without motion and some of them had walked round it several
times that by mounting upon each others shoulders they had got to the
top which was flat and even and stamping upon it they found that it
was hollow within that they humbly conceived it might be something
belonging to the man-mountain and if his majesty pleased they would
undertake to bring it with only five horses  i presently knew what they
meant and was glad at heart to receive this intelligence  it seems
upon my first reaching the shore after our shipwreck i was in such
confusion that before i came to the place where i went to sleep my hat
which i had fastened with a string to my head while i was rowing and had
stuck on all the time i was swimming fell off after i came to land the
string as i conjecture breaking by some accident which i never
observed but thought my hat had been lost at sea  i entreated his
imperial majesty to give orders it might be brought to me as soon as
possible describing to him the use and the nature of it and the next
day the waggoners arrived with it but not in a very good condition they
had bored two holes in the brim within an inch and half of the edge and
fastened two hooks in the holes these hooks were tied by a long cord to
the harness and thus my hat was dragged along for above half an english
mile but the ground in that country being extremely smooth and level
it received less damage than i expected

two days after this adventure the emperor having ordered that part of
his army which quarters in and about his metropolis to be in readiness
took a fancy of diverting himself in a very singular manner  he desired
i would stand like a colossus with my legs as far asunder as i
conveniently could  he then commanded his general (who was an old
experienced leader and a great patron of mine) to draw up the troops in
close order and march them under me the foot by twenty-four abreast
and the horse by sixteen with drums beating colours flying and pikes
advanced  this body consisted of three thousand foot and a thousand
horse  his majesty gave orders upon pain of death that every soldier
in his march should observe the strictest decency with regard to my
person which however could not prevent some of the younger officers from
turning up their eyes as they passed under me and to confess the truth
my breeches were at that time in so ill a condition that they afforded
some opportunities for laughter and admiration

i had sent so many memorials and petitions for my liberty that his
majesty at length mentioned the matter first in the cabinet and then in
a full council where it was opposed by none except skyresh bolgolam
who was pleased without any provocation to be my mortal enemy  but it
was carried against him by the whole board and confirmed by the emperor
that minister was galbet or admiral of the realm very much in his
masters confidence and a person well versed in affairs but of a morose
and sour complexion  however he was at length persuaded to comply but
prevailed that the articles and conditions upon which i should be set
free and to which i must swear should be drawn up by himself  these
articles were brought to me by skyresh bolgolam in person attended by two
under-secretaries and several persons of distinction  after they were
read i was demanded to swear to the performance of them first in the
manner of my own country and afterwards in the method prescribed by
their laws which was to hold my right foot in my left hand and to
place the middle finger of my right hand on the crown of my head and my
thumb on the tip of my right ear  but because the reader may be curious
to have some idea of the style and manner of expression peculiar to that
people as well as to know the article upon which i recovered my liberty
i have made a translation of the whole instrument word for word as near
as i was able which i here offer to the public

“golbasto momarem evlame gurdilo shefin mully ully gue most mighty
emperor of lilliput delight and terror of the universe whose dominions
extend five thousand blustrugs (about twelve miles in circumference) to
the extremities of the globe monarch of all monarchs taller than the
sons of men whose feet press down to the centre and whose head strikes
against the sun at whose nod the princes of the earth shake their knees
pleasant as the spring comfortable as the summer fruitful as autumn
dreadful as winter his most sublime majesty proposes to the
man-mountain lately arrived at our celestial dominions the following
articles which by a solemn oath he shall be obliged to perform—

“1st the man-mountain shall not depart from our dominions without our
license under our great seal

“2d he shall not presume to come into our metropolis without our
express order at which time the inhabitants shall have two hours
warning to keep within doors

“3d the said man-mountain shall confine his walks to our principal high
roads and not offer to walk or lie down in a meadow or field of corn

“4th as he walks the said roads he shall take the utmost care not to
trample upon the bodies of any of our loving subjects their horses or
carriages nor take any of our subjects into his hands without their own
consent

“5th if an express requires extraordinary despatch the man-mountain
shall be obliged to carry in his pocket the messenger and horse a six
days journey once in every moon and return the said messenger back (if
so required) safe to our imperial presence

“6th he shall be our ally against our enemies in the island of blefuscu
and do his utmost to destroy their fleet which is now preparing to
invade us

“7th that the said man-mountain shall at his times of leisure be
aiding and assisting to our workmen in helping to raise certain great
stones towards covering the wall of the principal park and other our
royal buildings

“8th that the said man-mountain shall in two moons time deliver in an
exact survey of the circumference of our dominions by a computation of
his own paces round the coast

“lastly that upon his solemn oath to observe all the above articles
the said man-mountain shall have a daily allowance of meat and drink
sufficient for the support of 1724 of our subjects with free access to
our royal person and other marks of our favour  given at our palace at
belfaborac the twelfth day of the ninety-first moon of our reign”

i swore and subscribed to these articles with great cheerfulness and
content although some of them were not so honourable as i could have
wished which proceeded wholly from the malice of skyresh bolgolam the
high-admiral whereupon my chains were immediately unlocked and i was at
full liberty  the emperor himself in person did me the honour to be by
at the whole ceremony  i made my acknowledgements by prostrating myself
at his majestys feet but he commanded me to rise and after many
gracious expressions which to avoid the censure of vanity i shall not
repeat he added “that he hoped i should prove a useful servant and
well deserve all the favours he had already conferred upon me or might
do for the future”

the reader may please to observe that in the last article of the
recovery of my liberty the emperor stipulates to allow me a quantity of
meat and drink sufficient for the support of 1724 lilliputians  some
time after asking a friend at court how they came to fix on that
determinate number he told me that his majestys mathematicians having
taken the height of my body by the help of a quadrant and finding it to
exceed theirs in the proportion of twelve to one they concluded from the
similarity of their bodies that mine must contain at least 1724 of
theirs and consequently would require as much food as was necessary to
support that number of lilliputians  by which the reader may conceive an
idea of the ingenuity of that people as well as the prudent and exact
economy of so great a prince



chapter iv


mildendo the metropolis of lilliput described together with the
emperors palace  a conversation between the author and a principal
secretary concerning the affairs of that empire  the authors offers to
serve the emperor in his wars

the first request i made after i had obtained my liberty was that i
might have license to see mildendo the metropolis which the emperor
easily granted me but with a special charge to do no hurt either to the
inhabitants or their houses  the people had notice by proclamation of
my design to visit the town  the wall which encompassed it is two feet
and a half high and at least eleven inches broad so that a coach and
horses may be driven very safely round it and it is flanked with strong
towers at ten feet distance  i stepped over the great western gate and
passed very gently and sidling through the two principal streets only
in my short waistcoat for fear of damaging the roofs and eaves of the
houses with the skirts of my coat  i walked with the utmost
circumspection to avoid treading on any stragglers who might remain in
the streets although the orders were very strict that all people should
keep in their houses at their own peril  the garret windows and tops of
houses were so crowded with spectators that i thought in all my travels
i had not seen a more populous place  the city is an exact square each
side of the wall being five hundred feet long  the two great streets
which run across and divide it into four quarters are five feet wide
the lanes and alleys which i could not enter but only view them as i
passed are from twelve to eighteen inches  the town is capable of
holding five hundred thousand souls the houses are from three to five
stories the shops and markets well provided

the emperors palace is in the centre of the city where the two great
streets meet  it is enclosed by a wall of two feet high and twenty feet
distance from the buildings  i had his majestys permission to step over
this wall and the space being so wide between that and the palace i
could easily view it on every side  the outward court is a square of
forty feet and includes two other courts in the inmost are the royal
apartments which i was very desirous to see but found it extremely
difficult for the great gates from one square into another were but
eighteen inches high and seven inches wide  now the buildings of the
outer court were at least five feet high and it was impossible for me to
stride over them without infinite damage to the pile though the walls
were strongly built of hewn stone and four inches thick  at the same
time the emperor had a great desire that i should see the magnificence of
his palace but this i was not able to do till three days after which i
spent in cutting down with my knife some of the largest trees in the
royal park about a hundred yards distant from the city  of these trees
i made two stools each about three feet high and strong enough to bear
my weight  the people having received notice a second time i went again
through the city to the palace with my two stools in my hands  when i
came to the side of the outer court i stood upon one stool and took the
other in my hand this i lifted over the roof and gently set it down on
the space between the first and second court which was eight feet wide
i then stept over the building very conveniently from one stool to the
other and drew up the first after me with a hooked stick  by this
contrivance i got into the inmost court and lying down upon my side i
applied my face to the windows of the middle stories which were left
open on purpose and discovered the most splendid apartments that can be
imagined  there i saw the empress and the young princes in their
several lodgings with their chief attendants about them  her imperial
majesty was pleased to smile very graciously upon me and gave me out of
the window her hand to kiss

but i shall not anticipate the reader with further descriptions of this
kind because i reserve them for a greater work which is now almost
ready for the press containing a general description of this empire
from its first erection through along series of princes with a
particular account of their wars and politics laws learning and
religion their plants and animals their peculiar manners and customs
with other matters very curious and useful my chief design at present
being only to relate such events and transactions as happened to the
public or to myself during a residence of about nine months in that
empire

one morning about a fortnight after i had obtained my liberty
reldresal principal secretary (as they style him) for private affairs
came to my house attended only by one servant  he ordered his coach to
wait at a distance and desired i would give him an hours audience which
i readily consented to on account of his quality and personal merits as
well as of the many good offices he had done me during my solicitations
at court  i offered to lie down that he might the more conveniently
reach my ear but he chose rather to let me hold him in my hand during
our conversation  he began with compliments on my liberty said “he
might pretend to some merit in it” but however added “that if it had
not been for the present situation of things at court perhaps i might
not have obtained it so soon  for” said he “as flourishing a condition
as we may appear to be in to foreigners we labour under two mighty
evils a violent faction at home and the danger of an invasion by a
most potent enemy from abroad  as to the first you are to understand
that for about seventy moons past there have been two struggling parties
in this empire under the names of tramecksan and slamecksan from
the high and low heels of their shoes by which they distinguish
themselves  it is alleged indeed that the high heels are most
agreeable to our ancient constitution but however this be his majesty
has determined to make use only of low heels in the administration of the
government and all offices in the gift of the crown as you cannot but
observe and particularly that his majestys imperial heels are lower at
least by a drurr than any of his court (drurr is a measure about the
fourteenth part of an inch)  the animosities between these two parties
run so high that they will neither eat nor drink nor talk with each
other  we compute the tramecksan or high heels to exceed us in
number but the power is wholly on our side  we apprehend his imperial
highness the heir to the crown to have some tendency towards the high
heels at least we can plainly discover that one of his heels is higher
than the other which gives him a hobble in his gait  now in the midst
of these intestine disquiets we are threatened with an invasion from the
island of blefuscu which is the other great empire of the universe
almost as large and powerful as this of his majesty  for as to what we
have heard you affirm that there are other kingdoms and states in the
world inhabited by human creatures as large as yourself our philosophers
are in much doubt and would rather conjecture that you dropped from the
moon or one of the stars because it is certain that a hundred mortals
of your bulk would in a short time destroy all the fruits and cattle of
his majestys dominions besides our histories of six thousand moons
make no mention of any other regions than the two great empires of
lilliput and blefuscu  which two mighty powers have as i was going to
tell you been engaged in a most obstinate war for six-and-thirty moons
past  it began upon the following occasion  it is allowed on all hands
that the primitive way of breaking eggs before we eat them was upon the
larger end but his present majestys grandfather while he was a boy
going to eat an egg and breaking it according to the ancient practice
happened to cut one of his fingers  whereupon the emperor his father
published an edict commanding all his subjects upon great penalties to
break the smaller end of their eggs  the people so highly resented this
law that our histories tell us there have been six rebellions raised on
that account wherein one emperor lost his life and another his crown
these civil commotions were constantly fomented by the monarchs of
blefuscu and when they were quelled the exiles always fled for refuge
to that empire  it is computed that eleven thousand persons have at
several times suffered death rather than submit to break their eggs at
the smaller end  many hundred large volumes have been published upon
this controversy but the books of the big-endians have been long
forbidden and the whole party rendered incapable by law of holding
employments  during the course of these troubles the emperors of
blefusca did frequently expostulate by their ambassadors accusing us of
making a schism in religion by offending against a fundamental doctrine
of our great prophet lustrog in the fifty-fourth chapter of the
blundecral (which is their alcoran)  this however is thought to be a
mere strain upon the text for the words are these  that all true
believers break their eggs at the convenient end  and which is the
convenient end seems in my humble opinion to be left to every mans
conscience or at least in the power of the chief magistrate to
determine  now the big-endian exiles have found so much credit in the
emperor of blefuscus court and so much private assistance and
encouragement from their party here at home that a bloody war has been
carried on between the two empires for six-and-thirty moons with various
success during which time we have lost forty capital ships and a much a
greater number of smaller vessels together with thirty thousand of our
best seamen and soldiers and the damage received by the enemy is
reckoned to be somewhat greater than ours  however they have now
equipped a numerous fleet and are just preparing to make a descent upon
us and his imperial majesty placing great confidence in your valour and
strength has commanded me to lay this account of his affairs before
you”

i desired the secretary to present my humble duty to the emperor and to
let him know “that i thought it would not become me who was a
foreigner to interfere with parties but i was ready with the hazard of
my life to defend his person and state against all invaders”



chapter v


the author by an extraordinary stratagem prevents an invasion  a high
title of honour is conferred upon him  ambassadors arrive from the
emperor of blefuscu and sue for peace  the empresss apartment on fire
by an accident the author instrumental in saving the rest of the palace

the empire of blefuscu is an island situated to the north-east of
lilliput from which it is parted only by a channel of eight hundred
yards wide  i had not yet seen it and upon this notice of an intended
invasion i avoided appearing on that side of the coast for fear of
being discovered by some of the enemys ships who had received no
intelligence of me all intercourse between the two empires having been
strictly forbidden during the war upon pain of death and an embargo
laid by our emperor upon all vessels whatsoever  i communicated to his
majesty a project i had formed of seizing the enemys whole fleet which
as our scouts assured us lay at anchor in the harbour ready to sail
with the first fair wind  i consulted the most experienced seamen upon
the depth of the channel which they had often plumbed who told me that
in the middle at high-water it was seventy glumgluffs deep which is
about six feet of european measure and the rest of it fifty glumgluffs
at most  i walked towards the north-east coast over against blefuscu
where lying down behind a hillock i took out my small perspective
glass and viewed the enemys fleet at anchor consisting of about fifty
men of war and a great number of transports i then came back to my
house and gave orders (for which i had a warrant) for a great quantity
of the strongest cable and bars of iron  the cable was about as thick as
packthread and the bars of the length and size of a knitting-needle  i
trebled the cable to make it stronger and for the same reason i twisted
three of the iron bars together bending the extremities into a hook
having thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables i went back to the
north-east coast and putting off my coat shoes and stockings walked
into the sea in my leathern jerkin about half an hour before high
water  i waded with what haste i could and swam in the middle about
thirty yards till i felt ground  i arrived at the fleet in less than
half an hour  the enemy was so frightened when they saw me that they
leaped out of their ships and swam to shore where there could not be
fewer than thirty thousand souls  i then took my tackling and
fastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each i tied all the cords
together at the end  while i was thus employed the enemy discharged
several thousand arrows many of which stuck in my hands and face and
beside the excessive smart gave me much disturbance in my work  my
greatest apprehension was for mine eyes which i should have infallibly
lost if i had not suddenly thought of an expedient  i kept among other
little necessaries a pair of spectacles in a private pocket which as i
observed before had escaped the emperors searchers  these i took out
and fastened as strongly as i could upon my nose and thus armed went on
boldly with my work in spite of the enemys arrows many of which struck
against the glasses of my spectacles but without any other effect
further than a little to discompose them  i had now fastened all the
hooks and taking the knot in my hand began to pull but not a ship
would stir for they were all too fast held by their anchors so that the
boldest part of my enterprise remained  i therefore let go the cord and
leaving the hooks fixed to the ships i resolutely cut with my knife the
cables that fastened the anchors receiving about two hundred shots in my
face and hands then i took up the knotted end of the cables to which my
hooks were tied and with great ease drew fifty of the enemys largest
men of war after me

the blefuscudians who had not the least imagination of what i intended
were at first confounded with astonishment  they had seen me cut the
cables and thought my design was only to let the ships run adrift or
fall foul on each other but when they perceived the whole fleet moving
in order and saw me pulling at the end they set up such a scream of
grief and despair as it is almost impossible to describe or conceive
when i had got out of danger i stopped awhile to pick out the arrows
that stuck in my hands and face and rubbed on some of the same ointment
that was given me at my first arrival as i have formerly mentioned  i
then took off my spectacles and waiting about an hour till the tide was
a little fallen i waded through the middle with my cargo and arrived
safe at the royal port of lilliput

the emperor and his whole court stood on the shore expecting the issue
of this great adventure  they saw the ships move forward in a large
half-moon but could not discern me who was up to my breast in water
when i advanced to the middle of the channel they were yet more in pain
because i was under water to my neck  the emperor concluded me to be
drowned and that the enemys fleet was approaching in a hostile manner
but he was soon eased of his fears for the channel growing shallower
every step i made i came in a short time within hearing and holding up
the end of the cable by which the fleet was fastened i cried in a loud
voice “long live the most puissant king of lilliput”  this great prince
received me at my landing with all possible encomiums and created me a
nardac upon the spot which is the highest title of honour among them

his majesty desired i would take some other opportunity of bringing all
the rest of his enemys ships into his ports  and so unmeasureable is
the ambition of princes that he seemed to think of nothing less than
reducing the whole empire of blefuscu into a province and governing it
by a viceroy of destroying the big-endian exiles and compelling that
people to break the smaller end of their eggs by which he would remain
the sole monarch of the whole world  but i endeavoured to divert him
from this design by many arguments drawn from the topics of policy as
well as justice and i plainly protested “that i would never be an
instrument of bringing a free and brave people into slavery”  and when
the matter was debated in council the wisest part of the ministry were
of my opinion

this open bold declaration of mine was so opposite to the schemes and
politics of his imperial majesty that he could never forgive me  he
mentioned it in a very artful manner at council where i was told that
some of the wisest appeared at least by their silence to be of my
opinion but others who were my secret enemies could not forbear some
expressions which by a side-wind reflected on me  and from this time
began an intrigue between his majesty and a junto of ministers
maliciously bent against me which broke out in less than two months and
had like to have ended in my utter destruction  of so little weight are
the greatest services to princes when put into the balance with a
refusal to gratify their passions

about three weeks after this exploit there arrived a solemn embassy from
blefuscu with humble offers of a peace which was soon concluded upon
conditions very advantageous to our emperor wherewith i shall not
trouble the reader  there were six ambassadors with a train of about
five hundred persons and their entry was very magnificent suitable to
the grandeur of their master and the importance of their business  when
their treaty was finished wherein i did them several good offices by the
credit i now had or at least appeared to have at court their
excellencies who were privately told how much i had been their friend
made me a visit in form  they began with many compliments upon my valour
and generosity invited me to that kingdom in the emperor their masters
name and desired me to show them some proofs of my prodigious strength
of which they had heard so many wonders wherein i readily obliged them
but shall not trouble the reader with the particulars

when i had for some time entertained their excellencies to their
infinite satisfaction and surprise i desired they would do me the honour
to present my most humble respects to the emperor their master the
renown of whose virtues had so justly filled the whole world with
admiration and whose royal person i resolved to attend before i
returned to my own country  accordingly the next time i had the honour
to see our emperor i desired his general license to wait on the
blefuscudian monarch which he was pleased to grant me as i could
perceive in a very cold manner but could not guess the reason till i
had a whisper from a certain person “that flimnap and bolgolam had
represented my intercourse with those ambassadors as a mark of
disaffection” from which i am sure my heart was wholly free  and this
was the first time i began to conceive some imperfect idea of courts and
ministers

it is to be observed that these ambassadors spoke to me by an
interpreter the languages of both empires differing as much from each
other as any two in europe and each nation priding itself upon the
antiquity beauty and energy of their own tongue with an avowed
contempt for that of their neighbour yet our emperor standing upon the
advantage he had got by the seizure of their fleet obliged them to
deliver their credentials and make their speech in the lilliputian
tongue  and it must be confessed that from the great intercourse of
trade and commerce between both realms from the continual reception of
exiles which is mutual among them and from the custom in each empire
to send their young nobility and richer gentry to the other in order to
polish themselves by seeing the world and understanding men and manners
there are few persons of distinction or merchants or seamen who dwell
in the maritime parts but what can hold conversation in both tongues as
i found some weeks after when i went to pay my respects to the emperor
of blefuscu which in the midst of great misfortunes through the malice
of my enemies proved a very happy adventure to me as i shall relate in
its proper place

the reader may remember that when i signed those articles upon which i
recovered my liberty there were some which i disliked upon account of
their being too servile neither could anything but an extreme necessity
have forced me to submit  but being now a nardac of the highest rank
in that empire such offices were looked upon as below my dignity and
the emperor (to do him justice) never once mentioned them to me
however it was not long before i had an opportunity of doing his
majesty at least as i then thought a most signal service  i was
alarmed at midnight with the cries of many hundred people at my door by
which being suddenly awaked i was in some kind of terror  i heard the
word burglum repeated incessantly several of the emperors court
making their way through the crowd entreated me to come immediately to
the palace where her imperial majestys apartment was on fire by the
carelessness of a maid of honour who fell asleep while she was reading a
romance  i got up in an instant and orders being given to clear the way
before me and it being likewise a moonshine night i made a shift to get
to the palace without trampling on any of the people  i found they had
already applied ladders to the walls of the apartment and were well
provided with buckets but the water was at some distance  these buckets
were about the size of large thimbles and the poor people supplied me
with them as fast as they could but the flame was so violent that they
did little good  i might easily have stifled it with my coat which i
unfortunately left behind me for haste and came away only in my leathern
jerkin  the case seemed wholly desperate and deplorable and this
magnificent palace would have infallibly been burnt down to the ground
if by a presence of mind unusual to me i had not suddenly thought of an
expedient  i had the evening before drunk plentifully of a most
delicious wine called glimigrim (the blefuscudians call it flunec
but ours is esteemed the better sort) which is very diuretic  by the
luckiest chance in the world i had not discharged myself of any part of
it  the heat i had contracted by coming very near the flames and by
labouring to quench them made the wine begin to operate by urine which
i voided in such a quantity and applied so well to the proper places
that in three minutes the fire was wholly extinguished and the rest of
that noble pile which had cost so many ages in erecting preserved from
destruction

it was now day-light and i returned to my house without waiting to
congratulate with the emperor because although i had done a very
eminent piece of service yet i could not tell how his majesty might
resent the manner by which i had performed it for by the fundamental
laws of the realm it is capital in any person of what quality soever
to make water within the precincts of the palace  but i was a little
comforted by a message from his majesty “that he would give orders to
the grand justiciary for passing my pardon in form” which however i
could not obtain and i was privately assured “that the empress
conceiving the greatest abhorrence of what i had done removed to the
most distant side of the court firmly resolved that those buildings
should never be repaired for her use and in the presence of her chief
confidents could not forbear vowing revenge”



chapter vi


of the inhabitants of lilliput their learning laws and customs the
manner of educating their children  the authors way of living in that
country  his vindication of a great lady

although i intend to leave the description of this empire to a particular
treatise yet in the mean time i am content to gratify the curious
reader with some general ideas  as the common size of the natives is
somewhat under six inches high so there is an exact proportion in all
other animals as well as plants and trees for instance the tallest
horses and oxen are between four and five inches in height the sheep an
inch and half more or less their geese about the bigness of a sparrow
and so the several gradations downwards till you come to the smallest
which to my sight were almost invisible but nature has adapted the eyes
of the lilliputians to all objects proper for their view they see with
great exactness but at no great distance  and to show the sharpness of
their sight towards objects that are near i have been much pleased with
observing a cook pulling a lark which was not so large as a common fly
and a young girl threading an invisible needle with invisible silk
their tallest trees are about seven feet high i mean some of those in
the great royal park the tops whereof i could but just reach with my
fist clenched  the other vegetables are in the same proportion but this
i leave to the readers imagination

i shall say but little at present of their learning which for many
ages has flourished in all its branches among them but their manner of
writing is very peculiar being neither from the left to the right like
the europeans nor from the right to the left like the arabians nor
from up to down like the chinese but aslant from one corner of the
paper to the other like ladies in england

they bury their dead with their heads directly downward because they
hold an opinion that in eleven thousand moons they are all to rise
again in which period the earth (which they conceive to be flat) will
turn upside down and by this means they shall at their resurrection be
found ready standing on their feet  the learned among them confess the
absurdity of this doctrine but the practice still continues in
compliance to the vulgar

there are some laws and customs in this empire very peculiar and if they
were not so directly contrary to those of my own dear country i should
be tempted to say a little in their justification  it is only to be
wished they were as well executed  the first i shall mention relates to
informers  all crimes against the state are punished here with the
utmost severity but if the person accused makes his innocence plainly
to appear upon his trial the accuser is immediately put to an
ignominious death and out of his goods or lands the innocent person is
quadruply recompensed for the loss of his time for the danger he
underwent for the hardship of his imprisonment and for all the charges
he has been at in making his defence or if that fund be deficient it
is largely supplied by the crown  the emperor also confers on him some
public mark of his favour and proclamation is made of his innocence
through the whole city

they look upon fraud as a greater crime than theft and therefore seldom
fail to punish it with death for they allege that care and vigilance
with a very common understanding may preserve a mans goods from
thieves but honesty has no defence against superior cunning and since
it is necessary that there should be a perpetual intercourse of buying
and selling and dealing upon credit where fraud is permitted and
connived at or has no law to punish it the honest dealer is always
undone and the knave gets the advantage  i remember when i was once
interceding with the emperor for a criminal who had wronged his master of
a great sum of money which he had received by order and ran away with
and happening to tell his majesty by way of extenuation that it was
only a breach of trust the emperor thought it monstrous in me to offer
as a defence the greatest aggravation of the crime and truly i had
little to say in return farther than the common answer that different
nations had different customs for i confess i was heartily ashamed
{330}

although we usually call reward and punishment the two hinges upon which
all government turns yet i could never observe this maxim to be put in
practice by any nation except that of lilliput  whoever can there bring
sufficient proof that he has strictly observed the laws of his country
for seventy-three moons has a claim to certain privileges according to
his quality or condition of life with a proportionable sum of money out
of a fund appropriated for that use he likewise acquires the title of
snilpall or legal which is added to his name but does not descend to
his posterity  and these people thought it a prodigious defect of policy
among us when i told them that our laws were enforced only by penalties
without any mention of reward  it is upon this account that the image of
justice in their courts of judicature is formed with six eyes two
before as many behind and on each side one to signify circumspection
with a bag of gold open in her right hand and a sword sheathed in her
left to show she is more disposed to reward than to punish

in choosing persons for all employments they have more regard to good
morals than to great abilities for since government is necessary to
mankind they believe that the common size of human understanding is
fitted to some station or other and that providence never intended to
make the management of public affairs a mystery to be comprehended only
by a few persons of sublime genius of which there seldom are three born
in an age but they suppose truth justice temperance and the like to
be in every mans power the practice of which virtues assisted by
experience and a good intention would qualify any man for the service of
his country except where a course of study is required  but they
thought the want of moral virtues was so far from being supplied by
superior endowments of the mind that employments could never be put into
such dangerous hands as those of persons so qualified and at least
that the mistakes committed by ignorance in a virtuous disposition
would never be of such fatal consequence to the public weal as the
practices of a man whose inclinations led him to be corrupt and who had
great abilities to manage to multiply and defend his corruptions

in like manner the disbelief of a divine providence renders a man
incapable of holding any public station for since kings avow themselves
to be the deputies of providence the lilliputians think nothing can be
more absurd than for a prince to employ such men as disown the authority
under which he acts

in relating these and the following laws i would only be understood to
mean the original institutions and not the most scandalous corruptions
into which these people are fallen by the degenerate nature of man  for
as to that infamous practice of acquiring great employments by dancing on
the ropes or badges of favour and distinction by leaping over sticks and
creeping under them the reader is to observe that they were first
introduced by the grandfather of the emperor now reigning and grew to
the present height by the gradual increase of party and faction

ingratitude is among them a capital crime as we read it to have been in
some other countries for they reason thus that whoever makes ill
returns to his benefactor must needs be a common enemy to the rest of
mankind from whom he has received no obligation and therefore such a
man is not fit to live

their notions relating to the duties of parents and children differ
extremely from ours  for since the conjunction of male and female is
founded upon the great law of nature in order to propagate and continue
the species the lilliputians will needs have it that men and women are
joined together like other animals by the motives of concupiscence and
that their tenderness towards their young proceeds from the like natural
principle for which reason they will never allow that a child is under
any obligation to his father for begetting him or to his mother for
bringing him into the world which considering the miseries of human
life was neither a benefit in itself nor intended so by his parents
whose thoughts in their love encounters were otherwise employed  upon
these and the like reasonings their opinion is that parents are the
last of all others to be trusted with the education of their own
children and therefore they have in every town public nurseries where
all parents except cottagers and labourers are obliged to send their
infants of both sexes to be reared and educated when they come to the
age of twenty moons at which time they are supposed to have some
rudiments of docility  these schools are of several kinds suited to
different qualities and both sexes  they have certain professors well
skilled in preparing children for such a condition of life as befits the
rank of their parents and their own capacities as well as inclinations
i shall first say something of the male nurseries and then of the
female

the nurseries for males of noble or eminent birth are provided with
grave and learned professors and their several deputies  the clothes
and food of the children are plain and simple  they are bred up in the
principles of honour justice courage modesty clemency religion and
love of their country they are always employed in some business except
in the times of eating and sleeping which are very short and two hours
for diversions consisting of bodily exercises  they are dressed by men
till four years of age and then are obliged to dress themselves
although their quality be ever so great and the women attendant who are
aged proportionably to ours at fifty perform only the most menial
offices  they are never suffered to converse with servants but go
together in smaller or greater numbers to take their diversions and
always in the presence of a professor or one of his deputies whereby
they avoid those early bad impressions of folly and vice to which our
children are subject  their parents are suffered to see them only twice
a year the visit is to last but an hour they are allowed to kiss the
child at meeting and parting but a professor who always stands by on
those occasions will not suffer them to whisper or use any fondling
expressions or bring any presents of toys sweetmeats and the like

the pension from each family for the education and entertainment of a
child upon failure of due payment is levied by the emperors officers

the nurseries for children of ordinary gentlemen merchants traders and
handicrafts are managed proportionably after the same manner only those
designed for trades are put out apprentices at eleven years old whereas
those of persons of quality continue in their exercises till fifteen
which answers to twenty-one with us but the confinement is gradually
lessened for the last three years

in the female nurseries the young girls of quality are educated much
like the males only they are dressed by orderly servants of their own
sex but always in the presence of a professor or deputy till they come
to dress themselves which is at five years old  and if it be found that
these nurses ever presume to entertain the girls with frightful or
foolish stories or the common follies practised by chambermaids among
us they are publicly whipped thrice about the city imprisoned for a
year and banished for life to the most desolate part of the country
thus the young ladies are as much ashamed of being cowards and fools as
the men and despise all personal ornaments beyond decency and
cleanliness neither did i perceive any difference in their education
made by their difference of sex only that the exercises of the females
were not altogether so robust and that some rules were given them
relating to domestic life and a smaller compass of learning was enjoined
them for their maxim is that among peoples of quality a wife should be
always a reasonable and agreeable companion because she cannot always be
young  when the girls are twelve years old which among them is the
marriageable age their parents or guardians take them home with great
expressions of gratitude to the professors and seldom without tears of
the young lady and her companions

in the nurseries of females of the meaner sort the children are
instructed in all kinds of works proper for their sex and their several
degrees those intended for apprentices are dismissed at seven years old
the rest are kept to eleven

the meaner families who have children at these nurseries are obliged
besides their annual pension which is as low as possible to return to
the steward of the nursery a small monthly share of their gettings to be
a portion for the child and therefore all parents are limited in their
expenses by the law  for the lilliputians think nothing can be more
unjust than for people in subservience to their own appetites to bring
children into the world and leave the burthen of supporting them on the
public  as to persons of quality they give security to appropriate a
certain sum for each child suitable to their condition and these funds
are always managed with good husbandry and the most exact justice

the cottagers and labourers keep their children at home their business
being only to till and cultivate the earth and therefore their education
is of little consequence to the public but the old and diseased among
them are supported by hospitals for begging is a trade unknown in this
empire

and here it may perhaps divert the curious reader to give some account
of my domestics and my manner of living in this country during a
residence of nine months and thirteen days  having a head mechanically
turned and being likewise forced by necessity i had made for myself a
table and chair convenient enough out of the largest trees in the royal
park  two hundred sempstresses were employed to make me shirts and
linen for my bed and table all of the strongest and coarsest kind they
could get which however they were forced to quilt together in several
folds for the thickest was some degrees finer than lawn  their linen is
usually three inches wide and three feet make a piece  the sempstresses
took my measure as i lay on the ground one standing at my neck and
another at my mid-leg with a strong cord extended that each held by the
end while a third measured the length of the cord with a rule of an inch
long  then they measured my right thumb and desired no more for by a
mathematical computation that twice round the thumb is once round the
wrist and so on to the neck and the waist and by the help of my old
shirt which i displayed on the ground before them for a pattern they
fitted me exactly  three hundred tailors were employed in the same
manner to make me clothes but they had another contrivance for taking my
measure  i kneeled down and they raised a ladder from the ground to my
neck upon this ladder one of them mounted and let fall a plumb-line
from my collar to the floor which just answered the length of my coat
but my waist and arms i measured myself  when my clothes were finished
which was done in my house (for the largest of theirs would not have been
able to hold them) they looked like the patch-work made by the ladies in
england only that mine were all of a colour

i had three hundred cooks to dress my victuals in little convenient huts
built about my house where they and their families lived and prepared
me two dishes a-piece  i took up twenty waiters in my hand and placed
them on the table a hundred more attended below on the ground some with
dishes of meat and some with barrels of wine and other liquors slung on
their shoulders all which the waiters above drew up as i wanted in a
very ingenious manner by certain cords as we draw the bucket up a well
in europe  a dish of their meat was a good mouthful and a barrel of
their liquor a reasonable draught  their mutton yields to ours but
their beef is excellent  i have had a sirloin so large that i have been
forced to make three bites of it but this is rare  my servants were
astonished to see me eat it bones and all as in our country we do the
leg of a lark  their geese and turkeys i usually ate at a mouthful and
i confess they far exceed ours  of their smaller fowl i could take up
twenty or thirty at the end of my knife

one day his imperial majesty being informed of my way of living desired
“that himself and his royal consort with the young princes of the blood
of both sexes might have the happiness” as he was pleased to call it
“of dining with me”  they came accordingly and i placed them in chairs
of state upon my table just over against me with their guards about
them  flimnap the lord high treasurer attended there likewise with his
white staff and i observed he often looked on me with a sour
countenance which i would not seem to regard but ate more than usual
in honour to my dear country as well as to fill the court with
admiration  i have some private reasons to believe that this visit from
his majesty gave flimnap an opportunity of doing me ill offices to his
master  that minister had always been my secret enemy though he
outwardly caressed me more than was usual to the moroseness of his
nature  he represented to the emperor “the low condition of his
treasury that he was forced to take up money at a great discount that
exchequer bills would not circulate under nine per cent below par that
i had cost his majesty above a million and a half of sprugs” (their
greatest gold coin about the bigness of a spangle) “and upon the whole
that it would be advisable in the emperor to take the first fair occasion
of dismissing me”

i am here obliged to vindicate the reputation of an excellent lady who
was an innocent sufferer upon my account  the treasurer took a fancy to
be jealous of his wife from the malice of some evil tongues who
informed him that her grace had taken a violent affection for my person
and the court scandal ran for some time that she once came privately to
my lodging  this i solemnly declare to be a most infamous falsehood
without any grounds further than that her grace was pleased to treat me
with all innocent marks of freedom and friendship  i own she came often
to my house but always publicly nor ever without three more in the
coach who were usually her sister and young daughter and some
particular acquaintance but this was common to many other ladies of the
court  and i still appeal to my servants round whether they at any time
saw a coach at my door without knowing what persons were in it  on
those occasions when a servant had given me notice my custom was to go
immediately to the door and after paying my respects to take up the
coach and two horses very carefully in my hands (for if there were six
horses the postillion always unharnessed four) and place them on a
table where i had fixed a movable rim quite round of five inches high
to prevent accidents  and i have often had four coaches and horses at
once on my table full of company while i sat in my chair leaning my
face towards them and when i was engaged with one set the coachmen
would gently drive the others round my table  i have passed many an
afternoon very agreeably in these conversations  but i defy the
treasurer or his two informers (i will name them and let them make the
best of it) clustril and drunlo to prove that any person ever came to me
incognito except the secretary reldresal who was sent by express
command of his imperial majesty as i have before related  i should not
have dwelt so long upon this particular if it had not been a point
wherein the reputation of a great lady is so nearly concerned to say
nothing of my own though i then had the honour to be a nardac which
the treasurer himself is not for all the world knows that he is only a
glumglum a title inferior by one degree as that of a marquis is to a
duke in england yet i allow he preceded me in right of his post  these
false informations which i afterwards came to the knowledge of by an
accident not proper to mention made the treasurer show his lady for some
time an ill countenance and me a worse and although he was at last
undeceived and reconciled to her yet i lost all credit with him and
found my interest decline very fast with the emperor himself who was
indeed too much governed by that favourite



chapter vii


the author being informed of a design to accuse him of high-treason
makes his escape to blefuscu  his reception there

before i proceed to give an account of my leaving this kingdom it may be
proper to inform the reader of a private intrigue which had been for two
months forming against me

i had been hitherto all my life a stranger to courts for which i was
unqualified by the meanness of my condition  i had indeed heard and read
enough of the dispositions of great princes and ministers but never
expected to have found such terrible effects of them in so remote a
country governed as i thought by very different maxims from those in
europe

when i was just preparing to pay my attendance on the emperor of
blefuscu a considerable person at court (to whom i had been very
serviceable at a time when he lay under the highest displeasure of his
imperial majesty) came to my house very privately at night in a close
chair and without sending his name desired admittance  the chairmen
were dismissed i put the chair with his lordship in it into my
coat-pocket and giving orders to a trusty servant to say i was
indisposed and gone to sleep i fastened the door of my house placed the
chair on the table according to my usual custom and sat down by it
after the common salutations were over observing his lordships
countenance full of concern and inquiring into the reason he desired “i
would hear him with patience in a matter that highly concerned my honour
and my life”  his speech was to the following effect for i took notes
of it as soon as he left me—

“you are to know” said he “that several committees of council have been
lately called in the most private manner on your account and it is but
two days since his majesty came to a full resolution

“you are very sensible that skyresh bolgolam” (galbet or high-admiral)
“has been your mortal enemy almost ever since your arrival  his
original reasons i know not but his hatred is increased since your great
success against blefuscu by which his glory as admiral is much obscured
this lord in conjunction with flimnap the high-treasurer whose enmity
against you is notorious on account of his lady limtoc the general
lalcon the chamberlain and balmuff the grand justiciary have prepared
articles of impeachment against you for treason and other capital
crimes”

this preface made me so impatient being conscious of my own merits and
innocence that i was going to interrupt him when he entreated me to be
silent and thus proceeded—

“out of gratitude for the favours you have done me i procured
information of the whole proceedings and a copy of the articles wherein
i venture my head for your service

    “ articles of impeachment against quinbus flestrin (the
    man-mountain)

    article i

    “ whereas by a statute made in the reign of his imperial majesty
    calin deffar plune it is enacted that whoever shall make water
    within the precincts of the royal palace shall be liable to the
    pains and penalties of high-treason notwithstanding the said
    quinbus flestrin in open breach of the said law under colour of
    extinguishing the fire kindled in the apartment of his majestys most
    dear imperial consort did maliciously traitorously and devilishly
    by discharge of his urine put out the said fire kindled in the said
    apartment lying and being within the precincts of the said royal
    palace against the statute in that case provided etc against the
    duty etc

    article ii

    “ that the said quinbus flestrin having brought the imperial fleet
    of blefuscu into the royal port and being afterwards commanded by
    his imperial majesty to seize all the other ships of the said empire
    of blefuscu and reduce that empire to a province to be governed by
    a viceroy from hence and to destroy and put to death not only all
    the big-endian exiles but likewise all the people of that empire who
    would not immediately forsake the big-endian heresy he the said
    flestrin like a false traitor against his most auspicious serene
    imperial majesty did petition to be excused from the said service
    upon pretence of unwillingness to force the consciences or destroy
    the liberties and lives of an innocent people

    article iii

    “ that whereas certain ambassadors arrived from the court of
    blefuscu to sue for peace in his majestys court he the said
    flestrin did like a false traitor aid abet comfort and divert
    the said ambassadors although he knew them to be servants to a
    prince who was lately an open enemy to his imperial majesty and in
    an open war against his said majesty

    article iv

    “ that the said quinbus flestrin contrary to the duty of a faithful
    subject is now preparing to make a voyage to the court and empire of
    blefuscu for which he has received only verbal license from his
    imperial majesty and under colour of the said license does falsely
    and traitorously intend to take the said voyage and thereby to aid
    comfort and abet the emperor of blefuscu so lately an enemy and in
    open war with his imperial majesty aforesaid

“there are some other articles but these are the most important of
which i have read you an abstract

“in the several debates upon this impeachment it must be confessed that
his majesty gave many marks of his great lenity often urging the
services you had done him and endeavouring to extenuate your crimes
the treasurer and admiral insisted that you should be put to the most
painful and ignominious death by setting fire to your house at night
and the general was to attend with twenty thousand men armed with
poisoned arrows to shoot you on the face and hands  some of your
servants were to have private orders to strew a poisonous juice on your
shirts and sheets which would soon make you tear your own flesh and die
in the utmost torture  the general came into the same opinion so that
for a long time there was a majority against you but his majesty
resolving if possible to spare your life at last brought off the
chamberlain

“upon this incident reldresal principal secretary for private affairs
who always approved himself your true friend was commanded by the
emperor to deliver his opinion which he accordingly did and therein
justified the good thoughts you have of him  he allowed your crimes to
be great but that still there was room for mercy the most commendable
virtue in a prince and for which his majesty was so justly celebrated
he said the friendship between you and him was so well known to the
world that perhaps the most honourable board might think him partial
however in obedience to the command he had received he would freely
offer his sentiments  that if his majesty in consideration of your
services and pursuant to his own merciful disposition would please to
spare your life and only give orders to put out both your eyes he
humbly conceived that by this expedient justice might in some measure be
satisfied and all the world would applaud the lenity of the emperor as
well as the fair and generous proceedings of those who have the honour to
be his counsellors  that the loss of your eyes would be no impediment to
your bodily strength by which you might still be useful to his majesty
that blindness is an addition to courage by concealing dangers from us
that the fear you had for your eyes was the greatest difficulty in
bringing over the enemys fleet and it would be sufficient for you to
see by the eyes of the ministers since the greatest princes do no more

“this proposal was received with the utmost disapprobation by the whole
board  bolgolam the admiral could not preserve his temper but rising
up in fury said he wondered how the secretary durst presume to give his
opinion for preserving the life of a traitor that the services you had
performed were by all true reasons of state the great aggravation of
your crimes that you who were able to extinguish the fire by discharge
of urine in her majestys apartment (which he mentioned with horror)
might at another time raise an inundation by the same means to drown
the whole palace and the same strength which enabled you to bring over
the enemys fleet might serve upon the first discontent to carry it
back that he had good reasons to think you were a big-endian in your
heart and as treason begins in the heart before it appears in
overt-acts so he accused you as a traitor on that account and therefore
insisted you should be put to death

“the treasurer was of the same opinion he showed to what straits his
majestys revenue was reduced by the charge of maintaining you which
would soon grow insupportable that the secretarys expedient of putting
out your eyes was so far from being a remedy against this evil that it
would probably increase it as is manifest from the common practice of
blinding some kind of fowls after which they fed the faster and grew
sooner fat that his sacred majesty and the council who are your judges
were in their own consciences fully convinced of your guilt which was
a sufficient argument to condemn you to death without the formal proofs
required by the strict letter of the law

“but his imperial majesty fully determined against capital punishment
was graciously pleased to say that since the council thought the loss of
your eyes too easy a censure some other way may be inflicted hereafter
and your friend the secretary humbly desiring to be heard again in
answer to what the treasurer had objected concerning the great charge
his majesty was at in maintaining you said that his excellency who had
the sole disposal of the emperors revenue might easily provide against
that evil by gradually lessening your establishment by which for want
of sufficient for you would grow weak and faint and lose your appetite
and consequently decay and consume in a few months neither would the
stench of your carcass be then so dangerous when it should become more
than half diminished and immediately upon your death five or six
thousand of his majestys subjects might in two or three days cut your
flesh from your bones take it away by cart-loads and bury it in distant
parts to prevent infection leaving the skeleton as a monument of
admiration to posterity

“thus by the great friendship of the secretary the whole affair was
compromised  it was strictly enjoined that the project of starving you
by degrees should be kept a secret but the sentence of putting out your
eyes was entered on the books none dissenting except bolgolam the
admiral who being a creature of the empress was perpetually instigated
by her majesty to insist upon your death she having borne perpetual
malice against you on account of that infamous and illegal method you
took to extinguish the fire in her apartment

“in three days your friend the secretary will be directed to come to your
house and read before you the articles of impeachment and then to
signify the great lenity and favour of his majesty and council whereby
you are only condemned to the loss of your eyes which his majesty does
not question you will gratefully and humbly submit to and twenty of his
majestys surgeons will attend in order to see the operation well
performed by discharging very sharp-pointed arrows into the balls of
your eyes as you lie on the ground

“i leave to your prudence what measures you will take and to avoid
suspicion i must immediately return in as private a manner as i came”

his lordship did so and i remained alone under many doubts and
perplexities of mind

it was a custom introduced by this prince and his ministry (very
different as i have been assured from the practice of former times)
that after the court had decreed any cruel execution either to gratify
the monarchs resentment or the malice of a favourite the emperor
always made a speech to his whole council expressing his great lenity
and tenderness as qualities known and confessed by all the world  this
speech was immediately published throughout the kingdom nor did any
thing terrify the people so much as those encomiums on his majestys
mercy because it was observed that the more these praises were enlarged
and insisted on the more inhuman was the punishment and the sufferer
more innocent  yet as to myself i must confess having never been
designed for a courtier either by my birth or education i was so ill a
judge of things that i could not discover the lenity and favour of this
sentence but conceived it (perhaps erroneously) rather to be rigorous
than gentle  i sometimes thought of standing my trial for although i
could not deny the facts alleged in the several articles yet i hoped
they would admit of some extenuation  but having in my life perused many
state-trials which i ever observed to terminate as the judges thought
fit to direct i durst not rely on so dangerous a decision in so
critical a juncture and against such powerful enemies  once i was
strongly bent upon resistance for while i had liberty the whole
strength of that empire could hardly subdue me and i might easily with
stones pelt the metropolis to pieces but i soon rejected that project
with horror by remembering the oath i had made to the emperor the
favours i received from him and the high title of nardac he conferred
upon me  neither had i so soon learned the gratitude of courtiers to
persuade myself that his majestys present seventies acquitted me of all
past obligations

at last i fixed upon a resolution for which it is probable i may incur
some censure and not unjustly for i confess i owe the preserving of
mine eyes and consequently my liberty to my own great rashness and want
of experience because if i had then known the nature of princes and
ministers which i have since observed in many other courts and their
methods of treating criminals less obnoxious than myself i should with
great alacrity and readiness have submitted to so easy a punishment
but hurried on by the precipitancy of youth and having his imperial
majestys license to pay my attendance upon the emperor of blefuscu i
took this opportunity before the three days were elapsed to send a
letter to my friend the secretary signifying my resolution of setting
out that morning for blefuscu pursuant to the leave i had got and
without waiting for an answer i went to that side of the island where
our fleet lay  i seized a large man of war tied a cable to the prow
and lifting up the anchors i stripped myself put my clothes (together
with my coverlet which i carried under my arm) into the vessel and
drawing it after me between wading and swimming arrived at the royal
port of blefuscu where the people had long expected me they lent me two
guides to direct me to the capital city which is of the same name  i
held them in my hands till i came within two hundred yards of the gate
and desired them “to signify my arrival to one of the secretaries and
let him know i there waited his majestys command”  i had an answer in
about an hour “that his majesty attended by the royal family and great
officers of the court was coming out to receive me”  i advanced a
hundred yards  the emperor and his train alighted from their horses the
empress and ladies from their coaches and i did not perceive they were
in any fright or concern  i lay on the ground to kiss his majestys and
the empresss hands  i told his majesty “that i was come according to
my promise and with the license of the emperor my master to have the
honour of seeing so mighty a monarch and to offer him any service in my
power consistent with my duty to my own prince” not mentioning a word
of my disgrace because i had hitherto no regular information of it and
might suppose myself wholly ignorant of any such design neither could i
reasonably conceive that the emperor would discover the secret while i
was out of his power wherein however it soon appeared i was deceived

i shall not trouble the reader with the particular account of my
reception at this court which was suitable to the generosity of so great
a prince nor of the difficulties i was in for want of a house and bed
being forced to lie on the ground wrapped up in my coverlet



chapter viii


the author by a lucky accident finds means to leave blefuscu and
after some difficulties returns safe to his native country

three days after my arrival walking out of curiosity to the north-east
coast of the island i observed about half a league off in the sea
somewhat that looked like a boat overturned  i pulled off my shoes and
stockings and wailing two or three hundred yards i found the object to
approach nearer by force of the tide and then plainly saw it to be a
real boat which i supposed might by some tempest have been driven from a
ship  whereupon i returned immediately towards the city and desired
his imperial majesty to lend me twenty of the tallest vessels he had
left after the loss of his fleet and three thousand seamen under the
command of his vice-admiral  this fleet sailed round while i went back
the shortest way to the coast where i first discovered the boat  i
found the tide had driven it still nearer  the seamen were all provided
with cordage which i had beforehand twisted to a sufficient strength
when the ships came up i stripped myself and waded till i came within a
hundred yards off the boat after which i was forced to swim till i got
up to it  the seamen threw me the end of the cord which i fastened to a
hole in the fore-part of the boat and the other end to a man of war but
i found all my labour to little purpose for being out of my depth i
was not able to work  in this necessity i was forced to swim behind and
push the boat forward as often as i could with one of my hands and the
tide favouring me i advanced so far that i could just hold up my chin
and feel the ground  i rested two or three minutes and then gave the
boat another shove and so on till the sea was no higher than my
arm-pits and now the most laborious part being over i took out my
other cables which were stowed in one of the ships and fastened them
first to the boat and then to nine of the vessels which attended me the
wind being favourable the seamen towed and i shoved until we arrived
within forty yards of the shore and waiting till the tide was out i
got dry to the boat and by the assistance of two thousand men with
ropes and engines i made a shift to turn it on its bottom and found it
was but little damaged

i shall not trouble the reader with the difficulties i was under by the
help of certain paddles which cost me ten days making to get my boat to
the royal port of blefuscu where a mighty concourse of people appeared
upon my arrival full of wonder at the sight of so prodigious a vessel
i told the emperor “that my good fortune had thrown this boat in my way
to carry me to some place whence i might return into my native country
and begged his majestys orders for getting materials to fit it up
together with his license to depart” which after some kind
expostulations he was pleased to grant

i did very much wonder in all this time not to have heard of any
express relating to me from our emperor to the court of blefuscu  but i
was afterward given privately to understand that his imperial majesty
never imagining i had the least notice of his designs believed i was
only gone to blefuscu in performance of my promise according to the
license he had given me which was well known at our court and would
return in a few days when the ceremony was ended  but he was at last in
pain at my long absence and after consulting with the treasurer and the
rest of that cabal a person of quality was dispatched with the copy of
the articles against me  this envoy had instructions to represent to the
monarch of blefuscu “the great lenity of his master who was content to
punish me no farther than with the loss of mine eyes that i had fled
from justice and if i did not return in two hours i should be deprived
of my title of nardac and declared a traitor”  the envoy further
added “that in order to maintain the peace and amity between both
empires his master expected that his brother of blefuscu would give
orders to have me sent back to lilliput bound hand and foot to be
punished as a traitor”

the emperor of blefuscu having taken three days to consult returned an
answer consisting of many civilities and excuses  he said “that as for
sending me bound his brother knew it was impossible that although i
had deprived him of his fleet yet he owed great obligations to me for
many good offices i had done him in making the peace  that however
both their majesties would soon be made easy for i had found a
prodigious vessel on the shore able to carry me on the sea which he had
given orders to fit up with my own assistance and direction and he
hoped in a few weeks both empires would be freed from so insupportable
an encumbrance”

with this answer the envoy returned to lilliput and the monarch of
blefuscu related to me all that had passed offering me at the same time
(but under the strictest confidence) his gracious protection if i would
continue in his service wherein although i believed him sincere yet i
resolved never more to put any confidence in princes or ministers where
i could possibly avoid it and therefore with all due acknowledgments
for his favourable intentions i humbly begged to be excused  i told
him “that since fortune whether good or evil had thrown a vessel in my
way i was resolved to venture myself on the ocean rather than be an
occasion of difference between two such mighty monarchs”  neither did i
find the emperor at all displeased and i discovered by a certain
accident that he was very glad of my resolution and so were most of his
ministers

these considerations moved me to hasten my departure somewhat sooner than
i intended to which the court impatient to have me gone very readily
contributed  five hundred workmen were employed to make two sails to my
boat according to my directions by quilting thirteen folds of their
strongest linen together  i was at the pains of making ropes and cables
by twisting ten twenty or thirty of the thickest and strongest of
theirs  a great stone that i happened to find after a long search by
the sea-shore served me for an anchor  i had the tallow of three
hundred cows for greasing my boat and other uses  i was at incredible
pains in cutting down some of the largest timber-trees for oars and
masts wherein i was however much assisted by his majestys
ship-carpenters who helped me in smoothing them after i had done the
rough work

in about a month when all was prepared i sent to receive his majestys
commands and to take my leave  the emperor and royal family came out of
the palace i lay down on my face to kiss his hand which he very
graciously gave me so did the empress and young princes of the blood
his majesty presented me with fifty purses of two hundred sprugs
a-piece together with his picture at full length which i put
immediately into one of my gloves to keep it from being hurt  the
ceremonies at my departure were too many to trouble the reader with at
this time

i stored the boat with the carcases of a hundred oxen and three hundred
sheep with bread and drink proportionable and as much meat ready
dressed as four hundred cooks could provide  i took with me six cows and
two bulls alive with as many ewes and rams intending to carry them into
my own country and propagate the breed  and to feed them on board i
had a good bundle of hay and a bag of corn  i would gladly have taken a
dozen of the natives but this was a thing the emperor would by no means
permit and besides a diligent search into my pockets his majesty
engaged my honour “not to carry away any of his subjects although with
their own consent and desire”

having thus prepared all things as well as i was able i set sail on the
twenty-fourth day of september 1701 at six in the morning and when i
had gone about four-leagues to the northward the wind being at
south-east at six in the evening i descried a small island about half a
league to the north-west  i advanced forward and cast anchor on the
lee-side of the island which seemed to be uninhabited  i then took some
refreshment and went to my rest  i slept well and as i conjectured at
least six hours for i found the day broke in two hours after i awaked
it was a clear night  i ate my breakfast before the sun was up and
heaving anchor the wind being favourable i steered the same course that
i had done the day before wherein i was directed by my pocket compass
my intention was to reach if possible one of those islands which i had
reason to believe lay to the north-east of van diemens land  i
discovered nothing all that day but upon the next about three in the
afternoon when i had by my computation made twenty-four leagues from
blefuscu i descried a sail steering to the south-east my course was due
east  i hailed her but could get no answer yet i found i gained upon
her for the wind slackened  i made all the sail i could and in half an
hour she spied me then hung out her ancient and discharged a gun  it
is not easy to express the joy i was in upon the unexpected hope of once
more seeing my beloved country and the dear pledges i left in it  the
ship slackened her sails and i came up with her between five and six in
the evening september 26th but my heart leaped within me to see her
english colours  i put my cows and sheep into my coat-pockets and got
on board with all my little cargo of provisions  the vessel was an
english merchantman returning from japan by the north and south seas
the captain mr john biddel of deptford a very civil man and an
excellent sailor

we were now in the latitude of 30 degrees south there were about fifty
men in the ship and here i met an old comrade of mine one peter
williams who gave me a good character to the captain  this gentleman
treated me with kindness and desired i would let him know what place i
came from last and whither i was bound which i did in a few words but
he thought i was raving and that the dangers i underwent had disturbed
my head whereupon i took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocket
which after great astonishment clearly convinced him of my veracity  i
then showed him the gold given me by the emperor of blefuscu together
with his majestys picture at full length and some other rarities of
that country  i gave him two purses of two hundreds sprugs each and
promised when we arrived in england to make him a present of a cow and
a sheep big with young

i shall not trouble the reader with a particular account of this voyage
which was very prosperous for the most part  we arrived in the downs on
the 13th of april 1702  i had only one misfortune that the rats on
board carried away one of my sheep i found her bones in a hole picked
clean from the flesh  the rest of my cattle i got safe ashore and set
them a-grazing in a bowling-green at greenwich where the fineness of the
grass made them feed very heartily though i had always feared the
contrary neither could i possibly have preserved them in so long a
voyage if the captain had not allowed me some of his best biscuit
which rubbed to powder and mingled with water was their constant food
the short time i continued in england i made a considerable profit by
showing my cattle to many persons of quality and others and before i
began my second voyage i sold them for six hundred pounds  since my
last return i find the breed is considerably increased especially the
sheep which i hope will prove much to the advantage of the woollen
manufacture by the fineness of the fleeces

i stayed but two months with my wife and family for my insatiable desire
of seeing foreign countries would suffer me to continue no longer  i
left fifteen hundred pounds with my wife and fixed her in a good house
at redriff  my remaining stock i carried with me part in money and part
in goods in hopes to improve my fortunes  my eldest uncle john had left
me an estate in land near epping of about thirty pounds a-year and i
had a long lease of the black bull in fetter-lane which yielded me as
much more so that i was not in any danger of leaving my family upon the
parish  my son johnny named so after his uncle was at the
grammar-school and a towardly child  my daughter betty (who is now well
married and has children) was then at her needle-work  i took leave of
my wife and boy and girl with tears on both sides and went on board
the adventure a merchant ship of three hundred tons bound for surat
captain john nicholas of liverpool commander  but my account of this
voyage must be referred to the second part of my travels

chapter i


a great storm described the long boat sent to fetch water the author
goes with it to discover the country  he is left on shore is seized by
one of the natives and carried to a farmers house  his reception with
several accidents that happened there  a description of the inhabitants

having been condemned by nature and fortune to active and restless
life in two months after my return i again left my native country and
took shipping in the downs on the 20th day of june 1702 in the
adventure captain john nicholas a cornish man commander bound for
surat  we had a very prosperous gale till we arrived at the cape of
good hope where we landed for fresh water but discovering a leak we
unshipped our goods and wintered there for the captain falling sick of
an ague we could not leave the cape till the end of march  we then set
sail and had a good voyage till we passed the straits of madagascar but
having got northward of that island and to about five degrees south
latitude the winds which in those seas are observed to blow a constant
equal gale between the north and west from the beginning of december to
the beginning of may on the 19th of april began to blow with much
greater violence and more westerly than usual continuing so for twenty
days together during which time we were driven a little to the east of
the molucca islands and about three degrees northward of the line as
our captain found by an observation he took the 2nd of may at which time
the wind ceased and it was a perfect calm whereat i was not a little
rejoiced  but he being a man well experienced in the navigation of
those seas bid us all prepare against a storm which accordingly
happened the day following for the southern wind called the southern
monsoon began to set in

finding it was likely to overblow we took in our sprit-sail and stood
by to hand the fore-sail but making foul weather we looked the guns
were all fast and handed the mizen  the ship lay very broad off so we
thought it better spooning before the sea than trying or hulling  we
reefed the fore-sail and set him and hauled aft the fore-sheet the helm
was hard a-weather  the ship wore bravely  we belayed the fore
down-haul but the sail was split and we hauled down the yard and got
the sail into the ship and unbound all the things clear of it  it was a
very fierce storm the sea broke strange and dangerous  we hauled off
upon the laniard of the whip-staff and helped the man at the helm  we
would not get down our top-mast but let all stand because she scudded
before the sea very well and we knew that the top-mast being aloft the
ship was the wholesomer and made better way through the sea seeing we
had sea-room  when the storm was over we set fore-sail and main-sail
and brought the ship to  then we set the mizen main-top-sail and the
fore-top-sail  our course was east-north-east the wind was at
south-west  we got the starboard tacks aboard we cast off our
weather-braces and lifts we set in the lee-braces and hauled forward by
the weather-bowlings and hauled them tight and belayed them and hauled
over the mizen tack to windward and kept her full and by as near as she
would lie

during this storm which was followed by a strong wind west-south-west
we were carried by my computation about five hundred leagues to the
east so that the oldest sailor on board could not tell in what part of
the world we were  our provisions held out well our ship was staunch
and our crew all in good health but we lay in the utmost distress for
water  we thought it best to hold on the same course rather than turn
more northerly which might have brought us to the north-west part of
great tartary and into the frozen sea

on the 16th day of june 1703 a boy on the top-mast discovered land  on
the 17th we came in full view of a great island or continent (for we
knew not whether) on the south side whereof was a small neck of land
jutting out into the sea and a creek too shallow to hold a ship of above
one hundred tons  we cast anchor within a league of this creek and our
captain sent a dozen of his men well armed in the long-boat with vessels
for water if any could be found  i desired his leave to go with them
that i might see the country and make what discoveries i could  when we
came to land we saw no river or spring nor any sign of inhabitants  our
men therefore wandered on the shore to find out some fresh water near the
sea and i walked alone about a mile on the other side where i observed
the country all barren and rocky  i now began to be weary and seeing
nothing to entertain my curiosity i returned gently down towards the
creek and the sea being full in my view i saw our men already got into
the boat and rowing for life to the ship  i was going to holla after
them although it had been to little purpose when i observed a huge
creature walking after them in the sea as fast as he could he waded not
much deeper than his knees and took prodigious strides but our men had
the start of him half a league and the sea thereabouts being full of
sharp-pointed rocks the monster was not able to overtake the boat  this
i was afterwards told for i durst not stay to see the issue of the
adventure but ran as fast as i could the way i first went and then
climbed up a steep hill which gave me some prospect of the country  i
found it fully cultivated but that which first surprised me was the
length of the grass which in those grounds that seemed to be kept for
hay was about twenty feet high

i fell into a high road for so i took it to be though it served to the
inhabitants only as a foot-path through a field of barley  here i walked
on for some time but could see little on either side it being now near
harvest and the corn rising at least forty feet  i was an hour walking
to the end of this field which was fenced in with a hedge of at least
one hundred and twenty feet high and the trees so lofty that i could
make no computation of their altitude  there was a stile to pass from
this field into the next  it had four steps and a stone to cross over
when you came to the uppermost  it was impossible for me to climb this
stile because every step was six-feet high and the upper stone about
twenty  i was endeavouring to find some gap in the hedge when i
discovered one of the inhabitants in the next field advancing towards
the stile of the same size with him whom i saw in the sea pursuing our
boat  he appeared as tall as an ordinary spire steeple and took about
ten yards at every stride as near as i could guess  i was struck with
the utmost fear and astonishment and ran to hide myself in the corn
whence i saw him at the top of the stile looking back into the next field
on the right hand and heard him call in a voice many degrees louder than
a speaking-trumpet but the noise was so high in the air that at first i
certainly thought it was thunder  whereupon seven monsters like
himself came towards him with reaping-hooks in their hands each hook
about the largeness of six scythes  these people were not so well clad
as the first whose servants or labourers they seemed to be for upon
some words he spoke they went to reap the corn in the field where i lay
i kept from them at as great a distance as i could but was forced to
move with extreme difficulty for the stalks of the corn were sometimes
not above a foot distant so that i could hardly squeeze my body betwixt
them  however i made a shift to go forward till i came to a part of
the field where the corn had been laid by the rain and wind  here it was
impossible for me to advance a step for the stalks were so interwoven
that i could not creep through and the beards of the fallen ears so
strong and pointed that they pierced through my clothes into my flesh
at the same time i heard the reapers not a hundred yards behind me
being quite dispirited with toil and wholly overcome by grief and
dispair i lay down between two ridges and heartily wished i might there
end my days  i bemoaned my desolate widow and fatherless children  i
lamented my own folly and wilfulness in attempting a second voyage
against the advice of all my friends and relations  in this terrible
agitation of mind i could not forbear thinking of lilliput whose
inhabitants looked upon me as the greatest prodigy that ever appeared in
the world where i was able to draw an imperial fleet in my hand and
perform those other actions which will be recorded for ever in the
chronicles of that empire while posterity shall hardly believe them
although attested by millions  i reflected what a mortification it must
prove to me to appear as inconsiderable in this nation as one single
lilliputian would be among us  but this i conceived was to be the least
of my misfortunes for as human creatures are observed to be more savage
and cruel in proportion to their bulk what could i expect but to be a
morsel in the mouth of the first among these enormous barbarians that
should happen to seize me?  undoubtedly philosophers are in the right
when they tell us that nothing is great or little otherwise than by
comparison  it might have pleased fortune to have let the lilliputians
find some nation where the people were as diminutive with respect to
them as they were to me  and who knows but that even this prodigious
race of mortals might be equally overmatched in some distant part of the
world whereof we have yet no discovery

scared and confounded as i was i could not forbear going on with these
reflections when one of the reapers approaching within ten yards of the
ridge where i lay made me apprehend that with the next step i should be
squashed to death under his foot or cut in two with his reaping-hook
and therefore when he was again about to move i screamed as loud as
fear could make me whereupon the huge creature trod short and looking
round about under him for some time at last espied me as i lay on the
ground  he considered awhile with the caution of one who endeavours to
lay hold on a small dangerous animal in such a manner that it shall not
be able either to scratch or bite him as i myself have sometimes done
with a weasel in england  at length he ventured to take me behind by
the middle between his fore-finger and thumb and brought me within
three yards of his eyes that he might behold my shape more perfectly  i
guessed his meaning and my good fortune gave me so much presence of
mind that i resolved not to struggle in the least as he held me in the
air above sixty feet from the ground although he grievously pinched my
sides for fear i should slip through his fingers  all i ventured was to
raise mine eyes towards the sun and place my hands together in a
supplicating posture and to speak some words in a humble melancholy
tone suitable to the condition i then was in for i apprehended every
moment that he would dash me against the ground as we usually do any
little hateful animal which we have a mind to destroy  but my good star
would have it that he appeared pleased with my voice and gestures and
began to look upon me as a curiosity much wondering to hear me pronounce
articulate words although he could not understand them  in the mean
time i was not able to forbear groaning and shedding tears and turning
my head towards my sides letting him know as well as i could how
cruelly i was hurt by the pressure of his thumb and finger  he seemed to
apprehend my meaning for lifting up the lappet of his coat he put me
gently into it and immediately ran along with me to his master who was
a substantial farmer and the same person i had first seen in the field

the farmer having (as i suppose by their talk) received such an account
of me as his servant could give him took a piece of a small straw about
the size of a walking-staff and therewith lifted up the lappets of my
coat which it seems he thought to be some kind of covering that nature
had given me  he blew my hairs aside to take a better view of my face
he called his hinds about him and asked them as i afterwards learned
whether they had ever seen in the fields any little creature that
resembled me  he then placed me softly on the ground upon all fours but
i got immediately up and walked slowly backward and forward to let
those people see i had no intent to run away  they all sat down in a
circle about me the better to observe my motions  i pulled off my hat
and made a low bow towards the farmer  i fell on my knees and lifted up
my hands and eyes and spoke several words as loud as i could i took a
purse of gold out of my pocket and humbly presented it to him  he
received it on the palm of his hand then applied it close to his eye to
see what it was and afterwards turned it several times with the point of
a pin (which he took out of his sleeve) but could make nothing of it
whereupon i made a sign that he should place his hand on the ground  i
then took the purse and opening it poured all the gold into his palm
there were six spanish pieces of four pistoles each beside twenty or
thirty smaller coins  i saw him wet the tip of his little finger upon
his tongue and take up one of my largest pieces and then another but
he seemed to be wholly ignorant what they were  he made me a sign to put
them again into my purse and the purse again into my pocket which
after offering it to him several times i thought it best to do

the farmer by this time was convinced i must be a rational creature
he spoke often to me but the sound of his voice pierced my ears like
that of a water-mill yet his words were articulate enough  i answered
as loud as i could in several languages and he often laid his ear within
two yards of me but all in vain for we were wholly unintelligible to
each other  he then sent his servants to their work and taking his
handkerchief out of his pocket he doubled and spread it on his left
hand which he placed flat on the ground with the palm upward making me
a sign to step into it as i could easily do for it was not above a foot
in thickness  i thought it my part to obey and for fear of falling
laid myself at full length upon the handkerchief with the remainder of
which he lapped me up to the head for further security and in this
manner carried me home to his house  there he called his wife and
showed me to her but she screamed and ran back as women in england do
at the sight of a toad or a spider  however when she had a while seen
my behaviour and how well i observed the signs her husband made she was
soon reconciled and by degrees grew extremely tender of me

it was about twelve at noon and a servant brought in dinner  it was
only one substantial dish of meat (fit for the plain condition of a
husbandman) in a dish of about four-and-twenty feet diameter  the
company were the farmer and his wife three children and an old
grandmother  when they were sat down the farmer placed me at some
distance from him on the table which was thirty feet high from the
floor  i was in a terrible fright and kept as far as i could from the
edge for fear of falling  the wife minced a bit of meat then crumbled
some bread on a trencher and placed it before me  i made her a low bow
took out my knife and fork and fell to eat which gave them exceeding
delight  the mistress sent her maid for a small dram cup which held
about two gallons and filled it with drink i took up the vessel with
much difficulty in both hands and in a most respectful manner drank to
her ladyships health expressing the words as loud as i could in
english which made the company laugh so heartily that i was almost
deafened with the noise  this liquor tasted like a small cider and was
not unpleasant  then the master made me a sign to come to his trencher
side but as i walked on the table being in great surprise all the time
as the indulgent reader will easily conceive and excuse i happened to
stumble against a crust and fell flat on my face but received no hurt
i got up immediately and observing the good people to be in much
concern i took my hat (which i held under my arm out of good manners)
and waving it over my head made three huzzas to show i had got no
mischief by my fall  but advancing forward towards my master (as i shall
henceforth call him) his youngest son who sat next to him an arch boy
of about ten years old took me up by the legs and held me so high in
the air that i trembled every limb but his father snatched me from him
and at the same time gave him such a box on the left ear as would have
felled an european troop of horse to the earth ordering him to be taken
from the table  but being afraid the boy might owe me a spite and well
remembering how mischievous all children among us naturally are to
sparrows rabbits young kittens and puppy dogs i fell on my knees and
pointing to the boy made my master to understand as well as i could
that i desired his son might be pardoned  the father complied and the
lad took his seat again whereupon i went to him and kissed his hand
which my master took and made him stroke me gently with it

in the midst of dinner my mistresss favourite cat leaped into her lap
i heard a noise behind me like that of a dozen stocking-weavers at work
and turning my head i found it proceeded from the purring of that
animal who seemed to be three times larger than an ox as i computed by
the view of her head and one of her paws while her mistress was feeding
and stroking her  the fierceness of this creatures countenance
altogether discomposed me though i stood at the farther end of the
table above fifty feet off and although my mistress held her fast for
fear she might give a spring and seize me in her talons  but it
happened there was no danger for the cat took not the least notice of me
when my master placed me within three yards of her  and as i have been
always told and found true by experience in my travels that flying or
discovering fear before a fierce animal is a certain way to make it
pursue or attack you so i resolved in this dangerous juncture to show
no manner of concern  i walked with intrepidity five or six times before
the very head of the cat and came within half a yard of her whereupon
she drew herself back as if she were more afraid of me i had less
apprehension concerning the dogs whereof three or four came into the
room as it is usual in farmers houses one of which was a mastiff
equal in bulk to four elephants and another a greyhound somewhat taller
than the mastiff but not so large

when dinner was almost done the nurse came in with a child of a year old
in her arms who immediately spied me and began a squall that you might
have heard from london-bridge to chelsea after the usual oratory of
infants to get me for a plaything  the mother out of pure indulgence
took me up and put me towards the child who presently seized me by the
middle and got my head into his mouth where i roared so loud that the
urchin was frighted and let me drop and i should infallibly have broke
my neck if the mother had not held her apron under me  the nurse to
quiet her babe made use of a rattle which was a kind of hollow vessel
filled with great stones and fastened by a cable to the childs waist
but all in vain so that she was forced to apply the last remedy by
giving it suck  i must confess no object ever disgusted me so much as
the sight of her monstrous breast which i cannot tell what to compare
with so as to give the curious reader an idea of its bulk shape and
colour  it stood prominent six feet and could not be less than sixteen
in circumference  the nipple was about half the bigness of my head and
the hue both of that and the dug so varied with spots pimples and
freckles that nothing could appear more nauseous for i had a near sight
of her she sitting down the more conveniently to give suck and i
standing on the table  this made me reflect upon the fair skins of our
english ladies who appear so beautiful to us only because they are of
our own size and their defects not to be seen but through a magnifying
glass where we find by experiment that the smoothest and whitest skins
look rough and coarse and ill-coloured

i remember when i was at lilliput the complexion of those diminutive
people appeared to me the fairest in the world and talking upon this
subject with a person of learning there who was an intimate friend of
mine he said that my face appeared much fairer and smoother when he
looked on me from the ground than it did upon a nearer view when i took
him up in my hand and brought him close which he confessed was at first
a very shocking sight  he said “he could discover great holes in my
skin that the stumps of my beard were ten times stronger than the
bristles of a boar and my complexion made up of several colours
altogether disagreeable” although i must beg leave to say for myself
that i am as fair as most of my sex and country and very little sunburnt
by all my travels  on the other side discoursing of the ladies in that
emperors court he used to tell me “one had freckles another too wide
a mouth a third too large a nose” nothing of which i was able to
distinguish  i confess this reflection was obvious enough which
however i could not forbear lest the reader might think those vast
creatures were actually deformed for i must do them the justice to say
they are a comely race of people and particularly the features of my
masters countenance although he was but a farmer when i beheld him
from the height of sixty feet appeared very well proportioned

when dinner was done my master went out to his labourers and as i
could discover by his voice and gesture gave his wife strict charge to
take care of me  i was very much tired and disposed to sleep which my
mistress perceiving she put me on her own bed and covered me with a
clean white handkerchief but larger and coarser than the main-sail of a
man-of-war

i slept about two hours and dreamt i was at home with my wife and
children which aggravated my sorrows when i awaked and found myself
alone in a vast room between two and three hundred feet wide and above
two hundred high lying in a bed twenty yards wide  my mistress was gone
about her household affairs and had locked me in  the bed was eight
yards from the floor  some natural necessities required me to get down
i durst not presume to call and if i had it would have been in vain
with such a voice as mine at so great a distance from the room where i
lay to the kitchen where the family kept  while i was under these
circumstances two rats crept up the curtains and ran smelling backwards
and forwards on the bed  one of them came up almost to my face
whereupon i rose in a fright and drew out my hanger to defend myself
these horrible animals had the boldness to attack me on both sides and
one of them held his fore-feet at my collar but i had the good fortune
to rip up his belly before he could do me any mischief  he fell down at
my feet and the other seeing the fate of his comrade made his escape
but not without one good wound on the back which i gave him as he fled
and made the blood run trickling from him  after this exploit i walked
gently to and fro on the bed to recover my breath and loss of spirits
these creatures were of the size of a large mastiff but infinitely more
nimble and fierce so that if i had taken off my belt before i went to
sleep i must have infallibly been torn to pieces and devoured  i
measured the tail of the dead rat and found it to be two yards long
wanting an inch but it went against my stomach to drag the carcass off
the bed where it lay still bleeding i observed it had yet some life
but with a strong slash across the neck i thoroughly despatched it

soon after my mistress came into the room who seeing me all bloody ran
and took me up in her hand  i pointed to the dead rat smiling and
making other signs to show i was not hurt whereat she was extremely
rejoiced calling the maid to take up the dead rat with a pair of tongs
and throw it out of the window  then she set me on a table where i
showed her my hanger all bloody and wiping it on the lappet of my coat
returned it to the scabbard  i was pressed to do more than one thing
which another could not do for me and therefore endeavoured to make my
mistress understand that i desired to be set down on the floor which
after she had done my bashfulness would not suffer me to express myself
farther than by pointing to the door and bowing several times  the
good woman with much difficulty at last perceived what i would be at
and taking me up again in her hand walked into the garden where she set
me down  i went on one side about two hundred yards and beckoning to
her not to look or to follow me i hid myself between two leaves of
sorrel and there discharged the necessities of nature

i hope the gentle reader will excuse me for dwelling on these and the
like particulars which however insignificant they may appear to
groveling vulgar minds yet will certainly help a philosopher to enlarge
his thoughts and imagination and apply them to the benefit of public as
well as private life which was my sole design in presenting this and
other accounts of my travels to the world wherein i have been chiefly
studious of truth without affecting any ornaments of learning or of
style  but the whole scene of this voyage made so strong an impression
on my mind and is so deeply fixed in my memory that in committing it
to paper i did not omit one material circumstance however upon a strict
review i blotted out several passages of less moment which were in my
first copy for fear of being censured as tedious and trifling whereof
travellers are often perhaps not without justice accused



chapter ii


a description of the farmers daughter  the author carried to a
market-town and then to the metropolis  the particulars of his journey

my mistress had a daughter of nine years old a child of towardly parts
for her age very dexterous at her needle and skilful in dressing her
baby  her mother and she contrived to fit up the babys cradle for me
against night the cradle was put into a small drawer of a cabinet and
the drawer placed upon a hanging shelf for fear of the rats  this was my
bed all the time i staid with those people though made more convenient
by degrees as i began to learn their language and make my wants known
this young girl was so handy that after i had once or twice pulled off
my clothes before her she was able to dress and undress me though i
never gave her that trouble when she would let me do either myself  she
made me seven shirts and some other linen of as fine cloth as could be
got which indeed was coarser than sackcloth and these she constantly
washed for me with her own hands  she was likewise my school-mistress
to teach me the language when i pointed to any thing she told me the
name of it in her own tongue so that in a few days i was able to call
for whatever i had a mind to  she was very good-natured and not above
forty feet high being little for her age  she gave me the name of
grildrig which the family took up and afterwards the whole kingdom
the word imports what the latins call nanunculus the italians
homunceletino and the english mannikin  to her i chiefly owe my
preservation in that country we never parted while i was there i called
her my glumdalclitch or little nurse and should be guilty of great
ingratitude if i omitted this honourable mention of her care and
affection towards me which i heartily wish it lay in my power to requite
as she deserves instead of being the innocent but unhappy instrument of
her disgrace as i have too much reason to fear

it now began to be known and talked of in the neighbourhood that my
master had found a strange animal in the field about the bigness of a
splacnuck but exactly shaped in every part like a human creature
which it likewise imitated in all its actions seemed to speak in a
little language of its own had already learned several words of theirs
went erect upon two legs was tame and gentle would come when it was
called do whatever it was bid had the finest limbs in the world and a
complexion fairer than a noblemans daughter of three years old  another
farmer who lived hard by and was a particular friend of my master came
on a visit on purpose to inquire into the truth of this story  i was
immediately produced and placed upon a table where i walked as i was
commanded drew my hanger put it up again made my reverence to my
masters guest asked him in his own language how he did and told him
he was welcome just as my little nurse had instructed me  this man
who was old and dim-sighted put on his spectacles to behold me better
at which i could not forbear laughing very heartily for his eyes
appeared like the full moon shining into a chamber at two windows  our
people who discovered the cause of my mirth bore me company in
laughing at which the old fellow was fool enough to be angry and out of
countenance  he had the character of a great miser and to my
misfortune he well deserved it by the cursed advice he gave my master
to show me as a sight upon a market-day in the next town which was half
an hours riding about two-and-twenty miles from our house  i guessed
there was some mischief when i observed my master and his friend
whispering together sometimes pointing at me and my fears made me fancy
that i overheard and understood some of their words  but the next
morning glumdalclitch my little nurse told me the whole matter which
she had cunningly picked out from her mother  the poor girl laid me on
her bosom and fell a weeping with shame and grief  she apprehended some
mischief would happen to me from rude vulgar folks who might squeeze me
to death or break one of my limbs by taking me in their hands  she had
also observed how modest i was in my nature how nicely i regarded my
honour and what an indignity i should conceive it to be exposed for
money as a public spectacle to the meanest of the people  she said her
papa and mamma had promised that grildrig should be hers but now she
found they meant to serve her as they did last year when they pretended
to give her a lamb and yet as soon as it was fat sold it to a butcher
for my own part i may truly affirm that i was less concerned than my
nurse  i had a strong hope which never left me that i should one day
recover my liberty and as to the ignominy of being carried about for a
monster i considered myself to be a perfect stranger in the country and
that such a misfortune could never be charged upon me as a reproach if
ever i should return to england since the king of great britain himself
in my condition must have undergone the same distress

my master pursuant to the advice of his friend carried me in a box the
next market-day to the neighbouring town and took along with him his
little daughter my nurse upon a pillion behind him  the box was close
on every side with a little door for me to go in and out and a few
gimlet holes to let in air  the girl had been so careful as to put the
quilt of her babys bed into it for me to lie down on  however i was
terribly shaken and discomposed in this journey though it was but of
half an hour for the horse went about forty feet at every step and
trotted so high that the agitation was equal to the rising and falling
of a ship in a great storm but much more frequent  our journey was
somewhat farther than from london to st albans  my master alighted at
an inn which he used to frequent and after consulting awhile with the
inn-keeper and making some necessary preparations he hired the
grultrud or crier to give notice through the town of a strange
creature to be seen at the sign of the green eagle not so big as a
splacnuck (an animal in that country very finely shaped about six feet
long) and in every part of the body resembling a human creature could
speak several words and perform a hundred diverting tricks

i was placed upon a table in the largest room of the inn which might be
near three hundred feet square  my little nurse stood on a low stool
close to the table to take care of me and direct what i should do  my
master to avoid a crowd would suffer only thirty people at a time to
see me  i walked about on the table as the girl commanded she asked me
questions as far as she knew my understanding of the language reached
and i answered them as loud as i could  i turned about several times to
the company paid my humble respects said they were welcome and used
some other speeches i had been taught  i took up a thimble filled with
liquor which glumdalclitch had given me for a cup and drank their
health i drew out my hanger and flourished with it after the manner of
fencers in england  my nurse gave me a part of a straw which i
exercised as a pike having learnt the art in my youth  i was that day
shown to twelve sets of company and as often forced to act over again
the same fopperies till i was half dead with weariness and vexation for
those who had seen me made such wonderful reports that the people were
ready to break down the doors to come in  my master for his own
interest would not suffer any one to touch me except my nurse and to
prevent danger benches were set round the table at such a distance as to
put me out of every bodys reach  however an unlucky school-boy aimed a
hazel nut directly at my head which very narrowly missed me otherwise
it came with so much violence that it would have infallibly knocked out
my brains for it was almost as large as a small pumpkin but i had the
satisfaction to see the young rogue well beaten and turned out of the
room

my master gave public notice that he would show me again the next
market-day and in the meantime he prepared a convenient vehicle for me
which he had reason enough to do for i was so tired with my first
journey and with entertaining company for eight hours together that i
could hardly stand upon my legs or speak a word  it was at least three
days before i recovered my strength and that i might have no rest at
home all the neighbouring gentlemen from a hundred miles round hearing
of my fame came to see me at my masters own house  there could not be
fewer than thirty persons with their wives and children (for the country
is very populous) and my master demanded the rate of a full room
whenever he showed me at home although it were only to a single family
so that for some time i had but little ease every day of the week (except
wednesday which is their sabbath) although i were not carried to the
town

my master finding how profitable i was likely to be resolved to carry
me to the most considerable cities of the kingdom  having therefore
provided himself with all things necessary for a long journey and
settled his affairs at home he took leave of his wife and upon the 17th
of august 1703 about two months after my arrival we set out for the
metropolis situate near the middle of that empire and about three
thousand miles distance from our house  my master made his daughter
glumdalclitch ride behind him  she carried me on her lap in a box tied
about her waist  the girl had lined it on all sides with the softest
cloth she could get well quilted underneath furnished it with her
babys bed provided me with linen and other necessaries and made
everything as convenient as she could  we had no other company but a boy
of the house who rode after us with the luggage

my masters design was to show me in all the towns by the way and to
step out of the road for fifty or a hundred miles to any village or
person of qualitys house where he might expect custom  we made easy
journeys of not above seven or eight score miles a-day for
glumdalclitch on purpose to spare me complained she was tired with the
trotting of the horse  she often took me out of my box at my own
desire to give me air and show me the country but always held me fast
by a leading-string  we passed over five or six rivers many degrees
broader and deeper than the nile or the ganges and there was hardly a
rivulet so small as the thames at london-bridge  we were ten weeks in
our journey and i was shown in eighteen large towns besides many
villages and private families

on the 26th day of october we arrived at the metropolis called in their
language lorbrulgrud or pride of the universe  my master took a
lodging in the principal street of the city not far from the royal
palace and put out bills in the usual form containing an exact
description of my person and parts  he hired a large room between three
and four hundred feet wide  he provided a table sixty feet in diameter
upon which i was to act my part and pallisadoed it round three feet from
the edge and as many high to prevent my falling over  i was shown ten
times a-day to the wonder and satisfaction of all people  i could now
speak the language tolerably well and perfectly understood every word
that was spoken to me  besides i had learnt their alphabet and could
make a shift to explain a sentence here and there for glumdalclitch had
been my instructor while we were at home and at leisure hours during our
journey  she carried a little book in her pocket not much larger than a
sansons atlas it was a common treatise for the use of young girls
giving a short account of their religion out of this she taught me my
letters and interpreted the words



chapter iii


the author sent for to court  the queen buys him of his master the
farmer and presents him to the king  he disputes with his majestys
great scholars  an apartment at court provided for the author  he is in
high favour with the queen  he stands up for the honour of his own
country  his quarrels with the queens dwarf

the frequent labours i underwent every day made in a few weeks a very
considerable change in my health the more my master got by me the more
insatiable he grew  i had quite lost my stomach and was almost reduced
to a skeleton  the farmer observed it and concluding i must soon die
resolved to make as good a hand of me as he could  while he was thus
reasoning and resolving with himself a sardral or gentleman-usher
came from court commanding my master to carry me immediately thither for
the diversion of the queen and her ladies  some of the latter had
already been to see me and reported strange things of my beauty
behaviour and good sense  her majesty and those who attended her were
beyond measure delighted with my demeanour  i fell on my knees and
begged the honour of kissing her imperial foot but this gracious
princess held out her little finger towards me after i was set on the
table which i embraced in both my arms and put the tip of it with the
utmost respect to my lip  she made me some general questions about my
country and my travels which i answered as distinctly and in as few
words as i could  she asked “whether i could be content to live at
court?”  i bowed down to the board of the table and humbly answered
“that i was my masters slave but if i were at my own disposal i
should be proud to devote my life to her majestys service”  she then
asked my master “whether he was willing to sell me at a good price?”
he who apprehended i could not live a month was ready enough to part
with me and demanded a thousand pieces of gold which were ordered him
on the spot each piece being about the bigness of eight hundred
moidores but allowing for the proportion of all things between that
country and europe and the high price of gold among them was hardly so
great a sum as a thousand guineas would be in england  i then said to
the queen “since i was now her majestys most humble creature and
vassal i must beg the favour that glumdalclitch who had always tended
me with so much care and kindness and understood to do it so well might
be admitted into her service and continue to be my nurse and
instructor”

her majesty agreed to my petition and easily got the farmers consent
who was glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court and the poor
girl herself was not able to hide her joy  my late master withdrew
bidding me farewell and saying he had left me in a good service to
which i replied not a word only making him a slight bow

the queen observed my coldness and when the farmer was gone out of the
apartment asked me the reason  i made bold to tell her majesty “that i
owed no other obligation to my late master than his not dashing out the
brains of a poor harmless creature found by chance in his fields which
obligation was amply recompensed by the gain he had made in showing me
through half the kingdom and the price he had now sold me for  that the
life i had since led was laborious enough to kill an animal of ten times
my strength  that my health was much impaired by the continual drudgery
of entertaining the rabble every hour of the day and that if my master
had not thought my life in danger her majesty would not have got so
cheap a bargain  but as i was out of all fear of being ill-treated under
the protection of so great and good an empress the ornament of nature
the darling of the world the delight of her subjects the phoenix of the
creation so i hoped my late masters apprehensions would appear to be
groundless for i already found my spirits revive by the influence of
her most august presence”

this was the sum of my speech delivered with great improprieties and
hesitation  the latter part was altogether framed in the style peculiar
to that people whereof i learned some phrases from glumdalclitch while
she was carrying me to court

the queen giving great allowance for my defectiveness in speaking was
however surprised at so much wit and good sense in so diminutive an
animal  she took me in her own hand and carried me to the king who was
then retired to his cabinet  his majesty a prince of much gravity and
austere countenance not well observing my shape at first view asked the
queen after a cold manner “how long it was since she grew fond of a
splacnuck?” for such it seems he took me to be as i lay upon my breast
in her majestys right hand  but this princess who has an infinite deal
of wit and humour set me gently on my feet upon the scrutoire and
commanded me to give his majesty an account of myself which i did in a
very few words and glumdalclitch who attended at the cabinet door and
could not endure i should be out of her sight being admitted confirmed
all that had passed from my arrival at her fathers house

the king although he be as learned a person as any in his dominions had
been educated in the study of philosophy and particularly mathematics
yet when he observed my shape exactly and saw me walk erect before i
began to speak conceived i might be a piece of clock-work (which is in
that country arrived to a very great perfection) contrived by some
ingenious artist  but when he heard my voice and found what i delivered
to be regular and rational he could not conceal his astonishment  he
was by no means satisfied with the relation i gave him of the manner i
came into his kingdom but thought it a story concerted between
glumdalclitch and her father who had taught me a set of words to make me
sell at a better price  upon this imagination he put several other
questions to me and still received rational answers no otherwise
defective than by a foreign accent and an imperfect knowledge in the
language with some rustic phrases which i had learned at the farmers
house and did not suit the polite style of a court

his majesty sent for three great scholars who were then in their weekly
waiting according to the custom in that country  these gentlemen after
they had a while examined my shape with much nicety were of different
opinions concerning me  they all agreed that i could not be produced
according to the regular laws of nature because i was not framed with a
capacity of preserving my life either by swiftness or climbing of
trees or digging holes in the earth  they observed by my teeth which
they viewed with great exactness that i was a carnivorous animal yet
most quadrupeds being an overmatch for me and field mice with some
others too nimble they could not imagine how i should be able to
support myself unless i fed upon snails and other insects which they
offered by many learned arguments to evince that i could not possibly
do  one of these virtuosi seemed to think that i might be an embryo or
abortive birth  but this opinion was rejected by the other two who
observed my limbs to be perfect and finished and that i had lived
several years as it was manifest from my beard the stumps whereof they
plainly discovered through a magnifying glass  they would not allow me
to be a dwarf because my littleness was beyond all degrees of
comparison for the queens favourite dwarf the smallest ever known in
that kingdom was near thirty feet high  after much debate they
concluded unanimously that i was only relplum scalcath which is
interpreted literally lusus naturæ a determination exactly agreeable
to the modern philosophy of europe whose professors disdaining the old
evasion of occult causes whereby the followers of aristotle endeavoured
in vain to disguise their ignorance have invented this wonderful
solution of all difficulties to the unspeakable advancement of human
knowledge

after this decisive conclusion i entreated to be heard a word or two  i
applied myself to the king and assured his majesty “that i came from a
country which abounded with several millions of both sexes and of my own
stature where the animals trees and houses were all in proportion
and where by consequence i might be as able to defend myself and to
find sustenance as any of his majestys subjects could do here which i
took for a full answer to those gentlemens arguments”  to this they
only replied with a smile of contempt saying “that the farmer had
instructed me very well in my lesson”  the king who had a much better
understanding dismissing his learned men sent for the farmer who by
good fortune was not yet gone out of town  having therefore first
examined him privately and then confronted him with me and the young
girl his majesty began to think that what we told him might possibly be
true he desired the queen to order that a particular care should be
taken of me and was of opinion that glumdalclitch should still continue
in her office of tending me because he observed we had a great affection
for each other  a convenient apartment was provided for her at court
she had a sort of governess appointed to take care of her education a
maid to dress her and two other servants for menial offices but the
care of me was wholly appropriated to herself  the queen commanded her
own cabinet-maker to contrive a box that might serve me for a
bedchamber after the model that glumdalclitch and i should agree upon
this man was a most ingenious artist and according to my direction in
three weeks finished for me a wooden chamber of sixteen feet square and
twelve high with sash-windows a door and two closets like a london
bed-chamber  the board that made the ceiling was to be lifted up and
down by two hinges to put in a bed ready furnished by her majestys
upholsterer which glumdalclitch took out every day to air made it with
her own hands and letting it down at night locked up the roof over me
a nice workman who was famous for little curiosities undertook to make
me two chairs with backs and frames of a substance not unlike ivory
and two tables with a cabinet to put my things in  the room was quilted
on all sides as well as the floor and the ceiling to prevent any
accident from the carelessness of those who carried me and to break the
force of a jolt when i went in a coach  i desired a lock for my door
to prevent rats and mice from coming in  the smith after several
attempts made the smallest that ever was seen among them for i have
known a larger at the gate of a gentlemans house in england  i made a
shift to keep the key in a pocket of my own fearing glumdalclitch might
lose it  the queen likewise ordered the thinnest silks that could be
gotten to make me clothes not much thicker than an english blanket
very cumbersome till i was accustomed to them  they were after the
fashion of the kingdom partly resembling the persian and partly the
chinese and are a very grave and decent habit

the queen became so fond of my company that she could not dine without
me  i had a table placed upon the same at which her majesty ate just at
her left elbow and a chair to sit on  glumdalclitch stood on a stool on
the floor near my table to assist and take care of me  i had an entire
set of silver dishes and plates and other necessaries which in
proportion to those of the queen were not much bigger than what i have
seen in a london toy-shop for the furniture of a baby-house these my
little nurse kept in her pocket in a silver box and gave me at meals as
i wanted them always cleaning them herself  no person dined with the
queen but the two princesses royal the eldest sixteen years old and the
younger at that time thirteen and a month  her majesty used to put a bit
of meat upon one of my dishes out of which i carved for myself and her
diversion was to see me eat in miniature for the queen (who had indeed
but a weak stomach) took up at one mouthful as much as a dozen english
farmers could eat at a meal which to me was for some time a very
nauseous sight  she would craunch the wing of a lark bones and all
between her teeth although it were nine times as large as that of a
full-grown turkey and put a bit of bread into her mouth as big as two
twelve-penny loaves  she drank out of a golden cup above a hogshead at
a draught  her knives were twice as long as a scythe set straight upon
the handle  the spoons forks and other instruments were all in the
same proportion  i remember when glumdalclitch carried me out of
curiosity to see some of the tables at court where ten or a dozen of
those enormous knives and forks were lifted up together i thought i had
never till then beheld so terrible a sight

it is the custom that every wednesday (which as i have observed is
their sabbath) the king and queen with the royal issue of both sexes
dine together in the apartment of his majesty to whom i was now become a
great favourite and at these times my little chair and table were
placed at his left hand before one of the salt-cellars  this prince
took a pleasure in conversing with me inquiring into the manners
religion laws government and learning of europe wherein i gave him
the best account i was able  his apprehension was so clear and his
judgment so exact that he made very wise reflections and observations
upon all i said  but i confess that after i had been a little too
copious in talking of my own beloved country of our trade and wars by
sea and land of our schisms in religion and parties in the state the
prejudices of his education prevailed so far that he could not forbear
taking me up in his right hand and stroking me gently with the other
after a hearty fit of laughing asked me “whether i was a whig or tory?”
then turning to his first minister who waited behind him with a white
staff near as tall as the mainmast of the royal sovereign he observed
“how contemptible a thing was human grandeur which could be mimicked by
such diminutive insects as i and yet” says he “i dare engage these
creatures have their titles and distinctions of honour they contrive
little nests and burrows that they call houses and cities they make a
figure in dress and equipage they love they fight they dispute they
cheat they betray”  and thus he continued on while my colour came and
went several times with indignation to hear our noble country the
mistress of arts and arms the scourge of france the arbitress of
europe the seat of virtue piety honour and truth the pride and envy
of the world so contemptuously treated

but as i was not in a condition to resent injuries so upon mature
thoughts i began to doubt whether i was injured or no  for after having
been accustomed several months to the sight and converse of this people
and observed every object upon which i cast mine eyes to be of
proportionable magnitude the horror i had at first conceived from their
bulk and aspect was so far worn off that if i had then beheld a company
of english lords and ladies in their finery and birth-day clothes acting
their several parts in the most courtly manner of strutting and bowing
and prating to say the truth i should have been strongly tempted to
laugh as much at them as the king and his grandees did at me  neither
indeed could i forbear smiling at myself when the queen used to place
me upon her hand towards a looking-glass by which both our persons
appeared before me in full view together and there could be nothing more
ridiculous than the comparison so that i really began to imagine myself
dwindled many degrees below my usual size

nothing angered and mortified me so much as the queens dwarf who being
of the lowest stature that was ever in that country (for i verily think
he was not full thirty feet high) became so insolent at seeing a
creature so much beneath him that he would always affect to swagger and
look big as he passed by me in the queens antechamber while i was
standing on some table talking with the lords or ladies of the court and
he seldom failed of a smart word or two upon my littleness against which
i could only revenge myself by calling him brother challenging him to
wrestle and such repartees as are usually in the mouths of court pages
one day at dinner this malicious little cub was so nettled with
something i had said to him that raising himself upon the frame of her
majestys chair he took me up by the middle as i was sitting down not
thinking any harm and let me drop into a large silver bowl of cream and
then ran away as fast as he could  i fell over head and ears and if i
had not been a good swimmer it might have gone very hard with me for
glumdalclitch in that instant happened to be at the other end of the
room and the queen was in such a fright that she wanted presence of
mind to assist me  but my little nurse ran to my relief and took me
out after i had swallowed above a quart of cream  i was put to bed
however i received no other damage than the loss of a suit of clothes
which was utterly spoiled  the dwarf was soundly whipt and as a farther
punishment forced to drink up the bowl of cream into which he had thrown
me neither was he ever restored to favour for soon after the queen
bestowed him on a lady of high quality so that i saw him no more to my
very great satisfaction for i could not tell to what extremities such a
malicious urchin might have carried his resentment

he had before served me a scurvy trick which set the queen a-laughing
although at the same time she was heartily vexed and would have
immediately cashiered him if i had not been so generous as to intercede
her majesty had taken a marrow-bone upon her plate and after knocking
out the marrow placed the bone again in the dish erect as it stood
before the dwarf watching his opportunity while glumdalclitch was gone
to the side-board mounted the stool that she stood on to take care of me
at meals took me up in both hands and squeezing my legs together
wedged them into the marrow bone above my waist where i stuck for some
time and made a very ridiculous figure  i believe it was near a minute
before any one knew what was become of me for i thought it below me to
cry out  but as princes seldom get their meat hot my legs were not
scalded only my stockings and breeches in a sad condition  the dwarf
at my entreaty had no other punishment than a sound whipping

i was frequently rallied by the queen upon account of my fearfulness and
she used to ask me whether the people of my country were as great cowards
as myself?  the occasion was this the kingdom is much pestered with
flies in summer and these odious insects each of them as big as a
dunstable lark hardly gave me any rest while i sat at dinner with their
continual humming and buzzing about mine ears  they would sometimes
alight upon my victuals and leave their loathsome excrement or spawn
behind which to me was very visible though not to the natives of that
country whose large optics were not so acute as mine in viewing smaller
objects  sometimes they would fix upon my nose or forehead where they
stung me to the quick smelling very offensively and i could easily
trace that viscous matter which our naturalists tell us enables those
creatures to walk with their feet upwards upon a ceiling  i had much ado
to defend myself against these detestable animals and could not forbear
starting when they came on my face  it was the common practice of the
dwarf to catch a number of these insects in his hand as schoolboys do
among us and let them out suddenly under my nose on purpose to frighten
me and divert the queen  my remedy was to cut them in pieces with my
knife as they flew in the air wherein my dexterity was much admired

i remember one morning when glumdalclitch had set me in a box upon a
window as she usually did in fair days to give me air (for i durst not
venture to let the box be hung on a nail out of the window as we do with
cages in england) after i had lifted up one of my sashes and sat down
at my table to eat a piece of sweet cake for my breakfast above twenty
wasps allured by the smell came flying into the room humming louder
than the drones of as many bagpipes  some of them seized my cake and
carried it piecemeal away others flew about my head and face
confounding me with the noise and putting me in the utmost terror of
their stings  however i had the courage to rise and draw my hanger and
attack them in the air  i dispatched four of them but the rest got
away and i presently shut my window  these insects were as large as
partridges i took out their stings found them an inch and a half long
and as sharp as needles  i carefully preserved them all and having
since shown them with some other curiosities in several parts of
europe upon my return to england i gave three of them to gresham
college and kept the fourth for myself



chapter iv


the country described  a proposal for correcting modern maps  the
kings palace and some account of the metropolis  the authors way of
travelling  the chief temple described

i now intend to give the reader a short description of this country as
far as i travelled in it which was not above two thousand miles round
lorbrulgrud the metropolis  for the queen whom i always attended
never went farther when she accompanied the king in his progresses and
there staid till his majesty returned from viewing his frontiers  the
whole extent of this princes dominions reaches about six thousand miles
in length and from three to five in breadth whence i cannot but
conclude that our geographers of europe are in a great error by
supposing nothing but sea between japan and california for it was ever
my opinion that there must be a balance of earth to counterpoise the
great continent of tartary and therefore they ought to correct their
maps and charts by joining this vast tract of land to the north-west
parts of america wherein i shall be ready to lend them my assistance

the kingdom is a peninsula terminated to the north-east by a ridge of
mountains thirty miles high which are altogether impassable by reason
of the volcanoes upon the tops neither do the most learned know what
sort of mortals inhabit beyond those mountains or whether they be
inhabited at all  on the three other sides it is bounded by the ocean
there is not one seaport in the whole kingdom and those parts of the
coasts into which the rivers issue are so full of pointed rocks and the
sea generally so rough that there is no venturing with the smallest of
their boats so that these people are wholly excluded from any commerce
with the rest of the world  but the large rivers are full of vessels
and abound with excellent fish for they seldom get any from the sea
because the sea fish are of the same size with those in europe and
consequently not worth catching whereby it is manifest that nature in
the production of plants and animals of so extraordinary a bulk is
wholly confined to this continent of which i leave the reasons to be
determined by philosophers  however now and then they take a whale that
happens to be dashed against the rocks which the common people feed on
heartily  these whales i have known so large that a man could hardly
carry one upon his shoulders and sometimes for curiosity they are
brought in hampers to lorbrulgrud i saw one of them in a dish at the
kings table which passed for a rarity but i did not observe he was
fond of it for i think indeed the bigness disgusted him although i
have seen one somewhat larger in greenland

the country is well inhabited for it contains fifty-one cities near a
hundred walled towns and a great number of villages  to satisfy my
curious reader it may be sufficient to describe lorbrulgrud  this city
stands upon almost two equal parts on each side the river that passes
through  it contains above eighty thousand houses and about six hundred
thousand inhabitants  it is in length three glomglungs (which make
about fifty-four english miles) and two and a half in breadth as i
measured it myself in the royal map made by the kings order which was
laid on the ground on purpose for me and extended a hundred feet i
paced the diameter and circumference several times barefoot and
computing by the scale measured it pretty exactly

the kings palace is no regular edifice but a heap of buildings about
seven miles round the chief rooms are generally two hundred and forty
feet high and broad and long in proportion  a coach was allowed to
glumdalclitch and me wherein her governess frequently took her out to
see the town or go among the shops and i was always of the party
carried in my box although the girl at my own desire would often take
me out and hold me in her hand that i might more conveniently view the
houses and the people as we passed along the streets  i reckoned our
coach to be about a square of westminster-hall but not altogether so
high however i cannot be very exact  one day the governess ordered our
coachman to stop at several shops where the beggars watching their
opportunity crowded to the sides of the coach and gave me the most
horrible spectacle that ever a european eye beheld  there was a woman
with a cancer in her breast swelled to a monstrous size full of holes
in two or three of which i could have easily crept and covered my whole
body  there was a fellow with a wen in his neck larger than five
wool-packs and another with a couple of wooden legs each about twenty
feet high  but the most hateful sight of all was the lice crawling on
their clothes  i could see distinctly the limbs of these vermin with my
naked eye much better than those of a european louse through a
microscope and their snouts with which they rooted like swine  they
were the first i had ever beheld and i should have been curious enough
to dissect one of them if i had had proper instruments which i
unluckily left behind me in the ship although indeed the sight was so
nauseous that it perfectly turned my stomach

besides the large box in which i was usually carried the queen ordered a
smaller one to be made for me of about twelve feet square and ten high
for the convenience of travelling because the other was somewhat too
large for glumdalclitchs lap and cumbersome in the coach it was made
by the same artist whom i directed in the whole contrivance  this
travelling-closet was an exact square with a window in the middle of
three of the squares and each window was latticed with iron wire on the
outside to prevent accidents in long journeys  on the fourth side
which had no window two strong staples were fixed through which the
person that carried me when i had a mind to be on horseback put a
leathern belt and buckled it about his waist  this was always the
office of some grave trusty servant in whom i could confide whether i
attended the king and queen in their progresses or were disposed to see
the gardens or pay a visit to some great lady or minister of state in
the court when glumdalclitch happened to be out of order for i soon
began to be known and esteemed among the greatest officers i suppose
more upon account of their majesties favour than any merit of my own
in journeys when i was weary of the coach a servant on horseback would
buckle on my box and place it upon a cushion before him and there i had
a full prospect of the country on three sides from my three windows  i
had in this closet a field-bed and a hammock hung from the ceiling
two chairs and a table neatly screwed to the floor to prevent being
tossed about by the agitation of the horse or the coach  and having been
long used to sea-voyages those motions although sometimes very violent
did not much discompose me

whenever i had a mind to see the town it was always in my
travelling-closet which glumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of open
sedan after the fashion of the country borne by four men and attended
by two others in the queens livery  the people who had often heard of
me were very curious to crowd about the sedan and the girl was
complaisant enough to make the bearers stop and to take me in her hand
that i might be more conveniently seen

i was very desirous to see the chief temple and particularly the tower
belonging to it which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom
accordingly one day my nurse carried me thither but i may truly say i
came back disappointed for the height is not above three thousand feet
reckoning from the ground to the highest pinnacle top which allowing
for the difference between the size of those people and us in europe is
no great matter for admiration nor at all equal in proportion (if i
rightly remember) to salisbury steeple  but not to detract from a
nation to which during my life i shall acknowledge myself extremely
obliged it must be allowed that whatever this famous tower wants in
height is amply made up in beauty and strength for the walls are near a
hundred feet thick built of hewn stone whereof each is about forty feet
square and adorned on all sides with statues of gods and emperors cut
in marble larger than the life placed in their several niches  i
measured a little finger which had fallen down from one of these statues
and lay unperceived among some rubbish and found it exactly four feet
and an inch in length  glumdalclitch wrapped it up in her handkerchief
and carried it home in her pocket to keep among other trinkets of which
the girl was very fond as children at her age usually are

the kings kitchen is indeed a noble building vaulted at top and about
six hundred feet high  the great oven is not so wide by ten paces as
the cupola at st pauls for i measured the latter on purpose after my
return  but if i should describe the kitchen grate the prodigious pots
and kettles the joints of meat turning on the spits with many other
particulars perhaps i should be hardly believed at least a severe
critic would be apt to think i enlarged a little as travellers are often
suspected to do  to avoid which censure i fear i have run too much into
the other extreme and that if this treatise should happen to be
translated into the language of brobdingnag (which is the general name of
that kingdom) and transmitted thither the king and his people would
have reason to complain that i had done them an injury by a false and
diminutive representation

his majesty seldom keeps above six hundred horses in his stables they
are generally from fifty-four to sixty feet high  but when he goes
abroad on solemn days he is attended for state by a military guard of
five hundred horse which indeed i thought was the most splendid sight
that could be ever beheld till i saw part of his army in battalia
whereof i shall find another occasion to speak



chapter v


several adventurers that happened to the author  the execution of a
criminal  the author shows his skill in navigation

i should have lived happy enough in that country if my littleness had
not exposed me to several ridiculous and troublesome accidents some of
which i shall venture to relate  glumdalclitch often carried me into the
gardens of the court in my smaller box and would sometimes take me out
of it and hold me in her hand or set me down to walk  i remember
before the dwarf left the queen he followed us one day into those
gardens and my nurse having set me down he and i being close together
near some dwarf apple trees i must needs show my wit by a silly
allusion between him and the trees which happens to hold in their
language as it does in ours  whereupon the malicious rogue watching
his opportunity when i was walking under one of them shook it directly
over my head by which a dozen apples each of them near as large as a
bristol barrel came tumbling about my ears one of them hit me on the
back as i chanced to stoop and knocked me down flat on my face but i
received no other hurt and the dwarf was pardoned at my desire because
i had given the provocation

another day glumdalclitch left me on a smooth grass-plot to divert
myself while she walked at some distance with her governess  in the
meantime there suddenly fell such a violent shower of hail that i was
immediately by the force of it struck to the ground and when i was
down the hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body as if i
had been pelted with tennis-balls however i made a shift to creep on
all fours and shelter myself by lying flat on my face on the lee-side
of a border of lemon-thyme but so bruised from head to foot that i
could not go abroad in ten days  neither is this at all to be wondered
at because nature in that country observing the same proportion
through all her operations a hailstone is near eighteen hundred times as
large as one in europe which i can assert upon experience having been
so curious as to weigh and measure them

but a more dangerous accident happened to me in the same garden when my
little nurse believing she had put me in a secure place (which i often
entreated her to do that i might enjoy my own thoughts) and having left
my box at home to avoid the trouble of carrying it went to another part
of the garden with her governess and some ladies of her acquaintance
while she was absent and out of hearing a small white spaniel that
belonged to one of the chief gardeners having got by accident into the
garden happened to range near the place where i lay the dog following
the scent came directly up and taking me in his mouth ran straight to
his master wagging his tail and set me gently on the ground  by good
fortune he had been so well taught that i was carried between his teeth
without the least hurt or even tearing my clothes  but the poor
gardener who knew me well and had a great kindness for me was in a
terrible fright he gently took me up in both his hands and asked me how
i did? but i was so amazed and out of breath that i could not speak a
word  in a few minutes i came to myself and he carried me safe to my
little nurse who by this time had returned to the place where she left
me and was in cruel agonies when i did not appear nor answer when she
called  she severely reprimanded the gardener on account of his dog
but the thing was hushed up and never known at court for the girl was
afraid of the queens anger and truly as to myself i thought it would
not be for my reputation that such a story should go about

this accident absolutely determined glumdalclitch never to trust me
abroad for the future out of her sight  i had been long afraid of this
resolution and therefore concealed from her some little unlucky
adventures that happened in those times when i was left by myself  once
a kite hovering over the garden made a stoop at me and if i had not
resolutely drawn my hanger and run under a thick espalier he would have
certainly carried me away in his talons  another time walking to the
top of a fresh mole-hill i fell to my neck in the hole through which
that animal had cast up the earth and coined some lie not worth
remembering to excuse myself for spoiling my clothes  i likewise broke
my right shin against the shell of a snail which i happened to stumble
over as i was walking alone and thinking on poor england

i cannot tell whether i were more pleased or mortified to observe in
those solitary walks that the smaller birds did not appear to be at all
afraid of me but would hop about within a yards distance looking for
worms and other food with as much indifference and security as if no
creature at all were near them  i remember a thrush had the confidence
to snatch out of my hand with his bill a of cake that glumdalclitch had
just given me for my breakfast  when i attempted to catch any of these
birds they would boldly turn against me endeavouring to peck my
fingers which i durst not venture within their reach and then they
would hop back unconcerned to hunt for worms or snails as they did
before  but one day i took a thick cudgel and threw it with all my
strength so luckily at a linnet that i knocked him down and seizing
him by the neck with both my hands ran with him in triumph to my nurse
however the bird who had only been stunned recovering himself gave me
so many boxes with his wings on both sides of my head and body though i
held him at arms-length and was out of the reach of his claws that i
was twenty times thinking to let him go  but i was soon relieved by one
of our servants who wrung off the birds neck and i had him next day
for dinner by the queens command  this linnet as near as i can
remember seemed to be somewhat larger than an english swan

the maids of honour often invited glumdalclitch to their apartments and
desired she would bring me along with her on purpose to have the
pleasure of seeing and touching me  they would often strip me naked from
top to toe and lay me at full length in their bosoms wherewith i was
much disgusted because to say the truth a very offensive smell came
from their skins which i do not mention or intend to the disadvantage
of those excellent ladies for whom i have all manner of respect but i
conceive that my sense was more acute in proportion to my littleness and
that those illustrious persons were no more disagreeable to their lovers
or to each other than people of the same quality are with us in england
and after all i found their natural smell was much more supportable
than when they used perfumes under which i immediately swooned away  i
cannot forget that an intimate friend of mine in lilliput took the
freedom in a warm day when i had used a good deal of exercise to
complain of a strong smell about me although i am as little faulty that
way as most of my sex but i suppose his faculty of smelling was as nice
with regard to me as mine was to that of this people  upon this point
i cannot forbear doing justice to the queen my mistress and
glumdalclitch my nurse whose persons were as sweet as those of any lady
in england

that which gave me most uneasiness among these maids of honour (when my
nurse carried me to visit then) was to see them use me without any
manner of ceremony like a creature who had no sort of consequence for
they would strip themselves to the skin and put on their smocks in my
presence while i was placed on their toilet directly before their naked
bodies which i am sure to me was very far from being a tempting sight
or from giving me any other emotions than those of horror and disgust
their skins appeared so coarse and uneven so variously coloured when i
saw them near with a mole here and there as broad as a trencher and
hairs hanging from it thicker than packthreads to say nothing farther
concerning the rest of their persons  neither did they at all scruple
while i was by to discharge what they had drank to the quantity of at
least two hogsheads in a vessel that held above three tuns  the
handsomest among these maids of honour a pleasant frolicsome girl of
sixteen would sometimes set me astride upon one of her nipples with
many other tricks wherein the reader will excuse me for not being over
particular  but i was so much displeased that i entreated glumdalclitch
to contrive some excuse for not seeing that young lady any more

one day a young gentleman who was nephew to my nurses governess came
and pressed them both to see an execution  it was of a man who had
murdered one of that gentlemans intimate acquaintance  glumdalclitch
was prevailed on to be of the company very much against her inclination
for she was naturally tender-hearted and as for myself although i
abhorred such kind of spectacles yet my curiosity tempted me to see
something that i thought must be extraordinary  the malefactor was fixed
in a chair upon a scaffold erected for that purpose and his head cut off
at one blow with a sword of about forty feet long  the veins and
arteries spouted up such a prodigious quantity of blood and so high in
the air that the great jet deau at versailles was not equal to it for
the time it lasted and the head when it fell on the scaffold floor
gave such a bounce as made me start although i was at least half an
english mile distant

the queen who often used to hear me talk of my sea-voyages and took all
occasions to divert me when i was melancholy asked me whether i
understood how to handle a sail or an oar and whether a little exercise
of rowing might not be convenient for my health?  i answered that i
understood both very well for although my proper employment had been to
be surgeon or doctor to the ship yet often upon a pinch i was forced
to work like a common mariner  but i could not see how this could be
done in their country where the smallest wherry was equal to a
first-rate man of war among us and such a boat as i could manage would
never live in any of their rivers  her majesty said if i would contrive
a boat her own joiner should make it and she would provide a place for
me to sail in  the fellow was an ingenious workman and by my
instructions in ten days finished a pleasure-boat with all its
tackling able conveniently to hold eight europeans  when it was
finished the queen was so delighted that she ran with it in her lap to
the king who ordered it to be put into a cistern full of water with me
in it by way of trial where i could not manage my two sculls or little
oars for want of room  but the queen had before contrived another
project  she ordered the joiner to make a wooden trough of three hundred
feet long fifty broad and eight deep which being well pitched to
prevent leaking was placed on the floor along the wall in an outer
room of the palace  it had a cock near the bottom to let out the water
when it began to grow stale and two servants could easily fill it in
half an hour  here i often used to row for my own diversion as well as
that of the queen and her ladies who thought themselves well entertained
with my skill and agility  sometimes i would put up my sail and then my
business was only to steer while the ladies gave me a gale with their
fans and when they were weary some of their pages would blow my sail
forward with their breath while i showed my art by steering starboard or
larboard as i pleased  when i had done glumdalclitch always carried
back my boat into her closet and hung it on a nail to dry

in this exercise i once met an accident which had like to have cost me
my life for one of the pages having put my boat into the trough the
governess who attended glumdalclitch very officiously lifted me up to
place me in the boat but i happened to slip through her fingers and
should infallibly have fallen down forty feet upon the floor if by the
luckiest chance in the world i had not been stopped by a corking-pin
that stuck in the good gentlewomans stomacher the head of the pin
passing between my shirt and the waistband of my breeches and thus i was
held by the middle in the air till glumdalclitch ran to my relief

another time one of the servants whose office it was to fill my trough
every third day with fresh water was so careless as to let a huge frog
(not perceiving it) slip out of his pail  the frog lay concealed till i
was put into my boat but then seeing a resting-place climbed up and
made it lean so much on one side that i was forced to balance it with
all my weight on the other to prevent overturning  when the frog was
got in it hopped at once half the length of the boat and then over my
head backward and forward daubing my face and clothes with its odious
slime  the largeness of its features made it appear the most deformed
animal that can be conceived  however i desired glumdalclitch to let me
deal with it alone  i banged it a good while with one of my sculls and
at last forced it to leap out of the boat

but the greatest danger i ever underwent in that kingdom was from a
monkey who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen  glumdalclitch
had locked me up in her closet while she went somewhere upon business
or a visit  the weather being very warm the closet-window was left
open as well as the windows and the door of my bigger box in which i
usually lived because of its largeness and conveniency  as i sat
quietly meditating at my table i heard something bounce in at the
closet-window and skip about from one side to the other whereat
although i was much alarmed yet i ventured to look out but not stirring
from my seat and then i saw this frolicsome animal frisking and leaping
up and down till at last he came to my box which he seemed to view with
great pleasure and curiosity peeping in at the door and every window  i
retreated to the farther corner of my room or box but the monkey
looking in at every side put me in such a fright that i wanted presence
of mind to conceal myself under the bed as i might easily have done
after some time spent in peeping grinning and chattering he at last
espied me and reaching one of his paws in at the door as a cat does
when she plays with a mouse although i often shifted place to avoid him
he at length seized the lappet of my coat (which being made of that
country silk was very thick and strong) and dragged me out  he took me
up in his right fore-foot and held me as a nurse does a child she is
going to suckle just as i have seen the same sort of creature do with a
kitten in europe and when i offered to struggle he squeezed me so hard
that i thought it more prudent to submit  i have good reason to believe
that he took me for a young one of his own species by his often stroking
my face very gently with his other paw  in these diversions he was
interrupted by a noise at the closet door as if somebody were opening
it whereupon he suddenly leaped up to the window at which he had come
in and thence upon the leads and gutters walking upon three legs and
holding me in the fourth till he clambered up to a roof that was next to
ours  i heard glumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he was carrying
me out  the poor girl was almost distracted that quarter of the palace
was all in an uproar the servants ran for ladders the monkey was seen
by hundreds in the court sitting upon the ridge of a building holding
me like a baby in one of his forepaws and feeding me with the other by
cramming into my mouth some victuals he had squeezed out of the bag on
one side of his chaps and patting me when i would not eat whereat many
of the rabble below could not forbear laughing neither do i think they
justly ought to be blamed for without question the sight was
ridiculous enough to every body but myself  some of the people threw up
stones hoping to drive the monkey down but this was strictly forbidden
or else very probably my brains had been dashed out

the ladders were now applied and mounted by several men which the
monkey observing and finding himself almost encompassed not being able
to make speed enough with his three legs let me drop on a ridge tile
and made his escape  here i sat for some time five hundred yards from
the ground expecting every moment to be blown down by the wind or to
fall by my own giddiness and come tumbling over and over from the ridge
to the eaves but an honest lad one of my nurses footmen climbed up
and putting me into his breeches pocket brought me down safe

i was almost choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed down my
throat but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth with a small
needle and then i fell a-vomiting which gave me great relief  yet i
was so weak and bruised in the sides with the squeezes given me by this
odious animal that i was forced to keep my bed a fortnight  the king
queen and all the court sent every day to inquire after my health and
her majesty made me several visits during my sickness  the monkey was
killed and an order made that no such animal should be kept about the
palace

when i attended the king after my recovery to return him thanks for his
favours he was pleased to rally me a good deal upon this adventure  he
asked me “what my thoughts and speculations were while i lay in the
monkeys paw how i liked the victuals he gave me his manner of feeding
and whether the fresh air on the roof had sharpened my stomach”  he
desired to know “what i would have done upon such an occasion in my own
country”  i told his majesty “that in europe we had no monkeys except
such as were brought for curiosity from other places and so small that
i could deal with a dozen of them together if they presumed to attack
me  and as for that monstrous animal with whom i was so lately engaged
(it was indeed as large as an elephant) if my fears had suffered me to
think so far as to make use of my hanger” (looking fiercely and
clapping my hand on the hilt as i spoke) “when he poked his paw into my
chamber perhaps i should have given him such a wound as would have made
him glad to withdraw it with more haste than he put it in”  this i
delivered in a firm tone like a person who was jealous lest his courage
should be called in question  however my speech produced nothing else
beside a loud laughter which all the respect due to his majesty from
those about him could not make them contain  this made me reflect how
vain an attempt it is for a man to endeavour to do himself honour among
those who are out of all degree of equality or comparison with him  and
yet i have seen the moral of my own behaviour very frequent in england
since my return where a little contemptible varlet without the least
title to birth person wit or common sense shall presume to look with
importance and put himself upon a foot with the greatest persons of the
kingdom

i was every day furnishing the court with some ridiculous story and
glumdalclitch although she loved me to excess yet was arch enough to
inform the queen whenever i committed any folly that she thought would
be diverting to her majesty  the girl who had been out of order was
carried by her governess to take the air about an hours distance or
thirty miles from town  they alighted out of the coach near a small
foot-path in a field and glumdalclitch setting down my travelling box i
went out of it to walk  there was a cow-dung in the path and i must
need try my activity by attempting to leap over it  i took a run but
unfortunately jumped short and found myself just in the middle up to my
knees  i waded through with some difficulty and one of the footmen
wiped me as clean as he could with his handkerchief for i was filthily
bemired and my nurse confined me to my box till we returned home where
the queen was soon informed of what had passed and the footmen spread it
about the court so that all the mirth for some days was at my expense



chapter vi


several contrivances of the author to please the king and queen  he
shows his skill in music  the king inquires into the state of england
which the author relates to him  the kings observations thereon

i used to attend the kings levee once or twice a week and had often
seen him under the barbers hand which indeed was at first very terrible
to behold for the razor was almost twice as long as an ordinary scythe
his majesty according to the custom of the country was only shaved
twice a-week  i once prevailed on the barber to give me some of the suds
or lather out of which i picked forty or fifty of the strongest stumps
of hair  i then took a piece of fine wood and cut it like the back of a
comb making several holes in it at equal distances with as small a
needle as i could get from glumdalclitch  i fixed in the stumps so
artificially scraping and sloping them with my knife toward the points
that i made a very tolerable comb which was a seasonable supply my own
being so much broken in the teeth that it was almost useless neither
did i know any artist in that country so nice and exact as would
undertake to make me another

and this puts me in mind of an amusement wherein i spent many of my
leisure hours  i desired the queens woman to save for me the combings
of her majestys hair whereof in time i got a good quantity and
consulting with my friend the cabinet-maker who had received general
orders to do little jobs for me i directed him to make two chair-frames
no larger than those i had in my box and to bore little holes with a
fine awl round those parts where i designed the backs and seats through
these holes i wove the strongest hairs i could pick out just after the
manner of cane chairs in england  when they were finished i made a
present of them to her majesty who kept them in her cabinet and used to
show them for curiosities as indeed they were the wonder of every one
that beheld them  the queen would have me sit upon one of these chairs
but i absolutely refused to obey her protesting i would rather die than
place a dishonourable part of my body on those precious hairs that once
adorned her majestys head  of these hairs (as i had always a mechanical
genius) i likewise made a neat little purse about five feet long with
her majestys name deciphered in gold letters which i gave to
glumdalclitch by the queens consent  to say the truth it was more for
show than use being not of strength to bear the weight of the larger
coins and therefore she kept nothing in it but some little toys that
girls are fond of

the king who delighted in music had frequent concerts at court to
which i was sometimes carried and set in my box on a table to hear them
but the noise was so great that i could hardly distinguish the tunes  i
am confident that all the drums and trumpets of a royal army beating and
sounding together just at your ears could not equal it  my practice was
to have my box removed from the place where the performers sat as far as
i could then to shut the doors and windows of it and draw the window
curtains after which i found their music not disagreeable

i had learned in my youth to play a little upon the spinet
glumdalclitch kept one in her chamber and a master attended twice a-week
to teach her i called it a spinet because it somewhat resembled that
instrument and was played upon in the same manner  a fancy came into my
head that i would entertain the king and queen with an english tune upon
this instrument  but this appeared extremely difficult for the spinet
was near sixty feet long each key being almost a foot wide so that with
my arms extended i could not reach to above five keys and to press them
down required a good smart stroke with my fist which would be too great
a labour and to no purpose  the method i contrived was this i prepared
two round sticks about the bigness of common cudgels they were thicker
at one end than the other and i covered the thicker ends with pieces of
a mouses skin that by rapping on them i might neither damage the tops
of the keys nor interrupt the sound  before the spinet a bench was
placed about four feet below the keys and i was put upon the bench  i
ran sideling upon it that way and this as fast as i could banging the
proper keys with my two sticks and made a shift to play a jig to the
great satisfaction of both their majesties but it was the most violent
exercise i ever underwent and yet i could not strike above sixteen keys
nor consequently play the bass and treble together as other artists do
which was a great disadvantage to my performance

the king who as i before observed was a prince of excellent
understanding would frequently order that i should be brought in my box
and set upon the table in his closet he would then command me to bring
one of my chairs out of the box and sit down within three yards distance
upon the top of the cabinet which brought me almost to a level with his
face  in this manner i had several conversations with him  i one day
took the freedom to tell his majesty “that the contempt he discovered
towards europe and the rest of the world did not seem answerable to
those excellent qualities of mind that he was master of that reason did
not extend itself with the bulk of the body on the contrary we observed
in our country that the tallest persons were usually the least provided
with it that among other animals bees and ants had the reputation of
more industry art and sagacity than many of the larger kinds and
that as inconsiderable as he took me to be i hoped i might live to do
his majesty some signal service”  the king heard me with attention and
began to conceive a much better opinion of me than he had ever before
he desired “i would give him as exact an account of the government of
england as i possibly could because as fond as princes commonly are of
their own customs (for so he conjectured of other monarchs by my former
discourses) he should be glad to hear of any thing that might deserve
imitation”

imagine with thyself courteous reader how often i then wished for the
tongue of demosthenes or cicero that might have enabled me to celebrate
the praise of my own dear native country in a style equal to its merits
and felicity

i began my discourse by informing his majesty that our dominions
consisted of two islands which composed three mighty kingdoms under one
sovereign beside our plantations in america  i dwelt long upon the
fertility of our soil and the temperature of our climate  i then spoke
at large upon the constitution of an english parliament partly made up
of an illustrious body called the house of peers persons of the noblest
blood and of the most ancient and ample patrimonies  i described that
extraordinary care always taken of their education in arts and arms to
qualify them for being counsellors both to the king and kingdom to have
a share in the legislature to be members of the highest court of
judicature whence there can be no appeal and to be champions always
ready for the defence of their prince and country by their valour
conduct and fidelity  that these were the ornament and bulwark of the
kingdom worthy followers of their most renowned ancestors whose honour
had been the reward of their virtue from which their posterity were
never once known to degenerate  to these were joined several holy
persons as part of that assembly under the title of bishops whose
peculiar business is to take care of religion and of those who instruct
the people therein  these were searched and sought out through the whole
nation by the prince and his wisest counsellors among such of the
priesthood as were most deservedly distinguished by the sanctity of their
lives and the depth of their erudition who were indeed the spiritual
fathers of the clergy and the people

that the other part of the parliament consisted of an assembly called the
house of commons who were all principal gentlemen freely picked and
culled out by the people themselves for their great abilities and love
of their country to represent the wisdom of the whole nation  and that
these two bodies made up the most august assembly in europe to whom in
conjunction with the prince the whole legislature is committed

i then descended to the courts of justice over which the judges those
venerable sages and interpreters of the law presided for determining
the disputed rights and properties of men as well as for the punishment
of vice and protection of innocence  i mentioned the prudent management
of our treasury the valour and achievements of our forces by sea and
land  i computed the number of our people by reckoning how many
millions there might be of each religious sect or political party among
us  i did not omit even our sports and pastimes or any other particular
which i thought might redound to the honour of my country  and i
finished all with a brief historical account of affairs and events in
england for about a hundred years past

this conversation was not ended under five audiences each of several
hours and the king heard the whole with great attention frequently
taking notes of what i spoke as well as memorandums of what questions he
intended to ask me

when i had put an end to these long discources his majesty in a sixth
audience consulting his notes proposed many doubts queries and
objections upon every article  he asked “what methods were used to
cultivate the minds and bodies of our young nobility and in what kind of
business they commonly spent the first and teachable parts of their
lives?  what course was taken to supply that assembly when any noble
family became extinct?  what qualifications were necessary in those who
are to be created new lords whether the humour of the prince a sum of
money to a court lady or a design of strengthening a party opposite to
the public interest ever happened to be the motive in those
advancements?  what share of knowledge these lords had in the laws of
their country and how they came by it so as to enable them to decide
the properties of their fellow-subjects in the last resort?  whether they
were always so free from avarice partialities or want that a bribe or
some other sinister view could have no place among them?  whether those
holy lords i spoke of were always promoted to that rank upon account of
their knowledge in religious matters and the sanctity of their lives
had never been compliers with the times while they were common priests
or slavish prostitute chaplains to some nobleman whose opinions they
continued servilely to follow after they were admitted into that
assembly?”

he then desired to know “what arts were practised in electing those whom
i called commoners whether a stranger with a strong purse might not
influence the vulgar voters to choose him before their own landlord or
the most considerable gentleman in the neighbourhood?  how it came to
pass that people were so violently bent upon getting into this assembly
which i allowed to be a great trouble and expense often to the ruin of
their families without any salary or pension? because this appeared such
an exalted strain of virtue and public spirit that his majesty seemed to
doubt it might possibly not be always sincere”  and he desired to know
“whether such zealous gentlemen could have any views of refunding
themselves for the charges and trouble they were at by sacrificing the
public good to the designs of a weak and vicious prince in conjunction
with a corrupted ministry?”  he multiplied his questions and sifted me
thoroughly upon every part of this head proposing numberless inquiries
and objections which i think it not prudent or convenient to repeat

upon what i said in relation to our courts of justice his majesty
desired to be satisfied in several points and this i was the better able
to do having been formerly almost ruined by a long suit in chancery
which was decreed for me with costs  he asked “what time was usually
spent in determining between right and wrong and what degree of expense?
whether advocates and orators had liberty to plead in causes manifestly
known to be unjust vexatious or oppressive?  whether party in religion
or politics were observed to be of any weight in the scale of justice?
whether those pleading orators were persons educated in the general
knowledge of equity or only in provincial national and other local
customs?  whether they or their judges had any part in penning those
laws which they assumed the liberty of interpreting and glossing upon
at their pleasure?  whether they had ever at different times pleaded
for and against the same cause and cited precedents to prove contrary
opinions?  whether they were a rich or a poor corporation?  whether they
received any pecuniary reward for pleading or delivering their opinions?
and particularly whether they were ever admitted as members in the lower
senate?”

he fell next upon the management of our treasury and said “he thought
my memory had failed me because i computed our taxes at about five or
six millions a-year and when i came to mention the issues he found they
sometimes amounted to more than double for the notes he had taken were
very particular in this point because he hoped as he told me that the
knowledge of our conduct might be useful to him and he could not be
deceived in his calculations  but if what i told him were true he was
still at a loss how a kingdom could run out of its estate like a private
person”  he asked me “who were our creditors and where we found money
to pay them?”  he wondered to hear me talk of such chargeable and
expensive wars “that certainly we must be a quarrelsome people or live
among very bad neighbours and that our generals must needs be richer
than our kings”  he asked “what business we had out of our own islands
unless upon the score of trade or treaty or to defend the coasts with
our fleet?”  above all he was amazed to hear me talk of a mercenary
standing army in the midst of peace and among a free people  he said
“if we were governed by our own consent in the persons of our
representatives he could not imagine of whom we were afraid or against
whom we were to fight and would hear my opinion whether a private mans
house might not be better defended by himself his children and family
than by half-a-dozen rascals picked up at a venture in the streets for
small wages who might get a hundred times more by cutting their
throats?”

he laughed at my “odd kind of arithmetic” as he was pleased to call it
“in reckoning the numbers of our people by a computation drawn from the
several sects among us in religion and politics”  he said “he knew no
reason why those who entertain opinions prejudicial to the public
should be obliged to change or should not be obliged to conceal them
and as it was tyranny in any government to require the first so it was
weakness not to enforce the second for a man may be allowed to keep
poisons in his closet but not to vend them about for cordials”

he observed “that among the diversions of our nobility and gentry i had
mentioned gaming he desired to know at what age this entertainment was
usually taken up and when it was laid down how much of their time it
employed whether it ever went so high as to affect their fortunes
whether mean vicious people by their dexterity in that art might not
arrive at great riches and sometimes keep our very nobles in dependence
as well as habituate them to vile companions wholly take them from the
improvement of their minds and force them by the losses they received
to learn and practise that infamous dexterity upon others?”

he was perfectly astonished with the historical account gave him of our
affairs during the last century protesting “it was only a heap of
conspiracies rebellions murders massacres revolutions banishments
the very worst effects that avarice faction hypocrisy perfidiousness
cruelty rage madness hatred envy lust malice and ambition could
produce”

his majesty in another audience was at the pains to recapitulate the
sum of all i had spoken compared the questions he made with the answers
i had given then taking me into his hands and stroking me gently
delivered himself in these words which i shall never forget nor the
manner he spoke them in “my little friend grildrig you have made a most
admirable panegyric upon your country you have clearly proved that
ignorance idleness and vice are the proper ingredients for qualifying
a legislator that laws are best explained interpreted and applied by
those whose interest and abilities lie in perverting confounding and
eluding them  i observe among you some lines of an institution which
in its original might have been tolerable but these half erased and
the rest wholly blurred and blotted by corruptions  it does not appear
from all you have said how any one perfection is required toward the
procurement of any one station among you much less that men are
ennobled on account of their virtue that priests are advanced for their
piety or learning soldiers for their conduct or valour judges for
their integrity senators for the love of their country or counsellors
for their wisdom  as for yourself” continued the king “who have spent
the greatest part of your life in travelling i am well disposed to hope
you may hitherto have escaped many vices of your country  but by what i
have gathered from your own relation and the answers i have with much
pains wrung and extorted from you i cannot but conclude the bulk of your
natives to be the most pernicious race of little odious vermin that
nature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of the earth”



chapter vii


the authors love of his country  he makes a proposal of much advantage
to the king which is rejected  the kings great ignorance in politics
the learning of that country very imperfect and confined  the laws and
military affairs and parties in the state

nothing but an extreme love of truth could have hindered me from
concealing this part of my story  it was in vain to discover my
resentments which were always turned into ridicule and i was forced to
rest with patience while my noble and beloved country was so injuriously
treated  i am as heartily sorry as any of my readers can possibly be
that such an occasion was given but this prince happened to be so
curious and inquisitive upon every particular that it could not consist
either with gratitude or good manners to refuse giving him what
satisfaction i was able  yet thus much i may be allowed to say in my own
vindication that i artfully eluded many of his questions and gave to
every point a more favourable turn by many degrees than the strictness
of truth would allow  for i have always borne that laudable partiality
to my own country which dionysius halicarnassensis with so much
justice recommends to an historian i would hide the frailties and
deformities of my political mother and place her virtues and beauties in
the most advantageous light  this was my sincere endeavour in those many
discourses i had with that monarch although it unfortunately failed of
success

but great allowances should be given to a king who lives wholly secluded
from the rest of the world and must therefore be altogether unacquainted
with the manners and customs that most prevail in other nations the want
of which knowledge will ever produce many prejudices and a certain
narrowness of thinking from which we and the politer countries of
europe are wholly exempted  and it would be hard indeed if so remote a
princes notions of virtue and vice were to be offered as a standard for
all mankind

to confirm what i have now said and further to show the miserable
effects of a confined education i shall here insert a passage which
will hardly obtain belief  in hopes to ingratiate myself further into
his majestys favour i told him of “an invention discovered between
three and four hundred years ago to make a certain powder into a heap
of which the smallest spark of fire falling would kindle the whole in a
moment although it were as big as a mountain and make it all fly up in
the air together with a noise and agitation greater than thunder  that
a proper quantity of this powder rammed into a hollow tube of brass or
iron according to its bigness would drive a ball of iron or lead with
such violence and speed as nothing was able to sustain its force  that
the largest balls thus discharged would not only destroy whole ranks of
an army at once but batter the strongest walls to the ground sink down
ships with a thousand men in each to the bottom of the sea and when
linked together by a chain would cut through masts and rigging divide
hundreds of bodies in the middle and lay all waste before them  that we
often put this powder into large hollow balls of iron and discharged
them by an engine into some city we were besieging which would rip up
the pavements tear the houses to pieces burst and throw splinters on
every side dashing out the brains of all who came near  that i knew the
ingredients very well which were cheap and common i understood the
manner of compounding them and could direct his workmen how to make
those tubes of a size proportionable to all other things in his
majestys kingdom and the largest need not be above a hundred feet long
twenty or thirty of which tubes charged with the proper quantity of
powder and balls would batter down the walls of the strongest town in
his dominions in a few hours or destroy the whole metropolis if ever it
should pretend to dispute his absolute commands”  this i humbly offered
to his majesty as a small tribute of acknowledgment in turn for so many
marks that i had received of his royal favour and protection

the king was struck with horror at the description i had given of those
terrible engines and the proposal i had made  “he was amazed how so
impotent and grovelling an insect as i” (these were his expressions)
“could entertain such inhuman ideas and in so familiar a manner as to
appear wholly unmoved at all the scenes of blood and desolation which i
had painted as the common effects of those destructive machines
whereof” he said “some evil genius enemy to mankind must have been
the first contriver  as for himself he protested that although few
things delighted him so much as new discoveries in art or in nature yet
he would rather lose half his kingdom than be privy to such a secret
which he commanded me as i valued any life never to mention any more”

a strange effect of narrow principles and views that a prince possessed
of every quality which procures veneration love and esteem of strong
parts great wisdom and profound learning endowed with admirable
talents and almost adored by his subjects should from a nice
unnecessary scruple whereof in europe we can have no conception let
slip an opportunity put into his hands that would have made him absolute
master of the lives the liberties and the fortunes of his people
neither do i say this with the least intention to detract from the many
virtues of that excellent king whose character i am sensible will on
this account be very much lessened in the opinion of an english reader
but i take this defect among them to have risen from their ignorance by
not having hitherto reduced politics into a science as the more acute
wits of europe have done  for i remember very well in a discourse one
day with the king when i happened to say “there were several thousand
books among us written upon the art of government” it gave him (directly
contrary to my intention) a very mean opinion of our understandings  he
professed both to abominate and despise all mystery refinement and
intrigue either in a prince or a minister  he could not tell what i
meant by secrets of state where an enemy or some rival nation were not
in the case  he confined the knowledge of governing within very narrow
bounds to common sense and reason to justice and lenity to the speedy
determination of civil and criminal causes with some other obvious
topics which are not worth considering  and he gave it for his opinion
“that whoever could make two ears of corn or two blades of grass to
grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before would deserve
better of mankind and do more essential service to his country than the
whole race of politicians put together”

the learning of this people is very defective consisting only in
morality history poetry and mathematics wherein they must be allowed
to excel  but the last of these is wholly applied to what may be useful
in life to the improvement of agriculture and all mechanical arts so
that among us it would be little esteemed  and as to ideas entities
abstractions and transcendentals i could never drive the least
conception into their heads

no law in that country must exceed in words the number of letters in
their alphabet which consists only of two and twenty  but indeed few of
them extend even to that length  they are expressed in the most plain
and simple terms wherein those people are not mercurial enough to
discover above one interpretation and to write a comment upon any law
is a capital crime  as to the decision of civil causes or proceedings
against criminals their precedents are so few that they have little
reason to boast of any extraordinary skill in either

they have had the art of printing as well as the chinese time out of
mind but their libraries are not very large for that of the king which
is reckoned the largest does not amount to above a thousand volumes
placed in a gallery of twelve hundred feet long whence i had liberty to
borrow what books i pleased  the queens joiner had contrived in one of
glumdalclitchs rooms a kind of wooden machine five-and-twenty feet
high formed like a standing ladder the steps were each fifty feet long
it was indeed a moveable pair of stairs the lowest end placed at ten
feet distance from the wall of the chamber  the book i had a mind to
read was put up leaning against the wall i first mounted to the upper
step of the ladder and turning my face towards the book began at the
top of the page and so walking to the right and left about eight or ten
paces according to the length of the lines till i had gotten a little
below the level of mine eyes and then descending gradually till i came
to the bottom after which i mounted again and began the other page in
the same manner and so turned over the leaf which i could easily do
with both my hands for it was as thick and stiff as a pasteboard and in
the largest folios not above eighteen or twenty feet long

their style is clear masculine and smooth but not florid for they
avoid nothing more than multiplying unnecessary words or using various
expressions  i have perused many of their books especially those in
history and morality  among the rest i was much diverted with a little
old treatise which always lay in glumdalclitchs bed chamber and
belonged to her governess a grave elderly gentlewoman who dealt in
writings of morality and devotion  the book treats of the weakness of
human kind and is in little esteem except among the women and the
vulgar  however i was curious to see what an author of that country
could say upon such a subject  this writer went through all the usual
topics of european moralists showing “how diminutive contemptible and
helpless an animal was man in his own nature how unable to defend
himself from inclemencies of the air or the fury of wild beasts how
much he was excelled by one creature in strength by another in speed by
a third in foresight by a fourth in industry”  he added “that nature
was degenerated in these latter declining ages of the world and could
now produce only small abortive births in comparison of those in ancient
times”  he said “it was very reasonable to think not only that the
species of men were originally much larger but also that there must have
been giants in former ages which as it is asserted by history and
tradition so it has been confirmed by huge bones and skulls casually
dug up in several parts of the kingdom far exceeding the common dwindled
race of men in our days”  he argued “that the very laws of nature
absolutely required we should have been made in the beginning of a size
more large and robust not so liable to destruction from every little
accident of a tile falling from a house or a stone cast from the hand
of a boy or being drowned in a little brook”  from this way of
reasoning the author drew several moral applications useful in the
conduct of life but needless here to repeat  for my own part i could
not avoid reflecting how universally this talent was spread of drawing
lectures in morality or indeed rather matter of discontent and repining
from the quarrels we raise with nature  and i believe upon a strict
inquiry those quarrels might be shown as ill-grounded among us as they
are among that people

as to their military affairs they boast that the kings army consists of
a hundred and seventy-six thousand foot and thirty-two thousand horse
if that may be called an army which is made up of tradesmen in the
several cities and farmers in the country whose commanders are only the
nobility and gentry without pay or reward  they are indeed perfect
enough in their exercises and under very good discipline wherein i saw
no great merit for how should it be otherwise where every farmer is
under the command of his own landlord and every citizen under that of
the principal men in his own city chosen after the manner of venice by
ballot?

i have often seen the militia of lorbrulgrud drawn out to exercise in a
great field near the city of twenty miles square  they were in all not
above twenty-five thousand foot and six thousand horse but it was
impossible for me to compute their number considering the space of
ground they took up  a cavalier mounted on a large steed might be
about ninety feet high  i have seen this whole body of horse upon a
word of command draw their swords at once and brandish them in the air
imagination can figure nothing so grand so surprising and so
astonishing it looked as if ten thousand flashes of lightning were
darting at the same time from every quarter of the sky

i was curious to know how this prince to whose dominions there is no
access from any other country came to think of armies or to teach his
people the practice of military discipline  but i was soon informed
both by conversation and reading their histories for in the course of
many ages they have been troubled with the same disease to which the
whole race of mankind is subject the nobility often contending for
power the people for liberty and the king for absolute dominion  all
which however happily tempered by the laws of that kingdom have been
sometimes violated by each of the three parties and have more than once
occasioned civil wars the last whereof was happily put an end to by this
princes grand-father in a general composition and the militia then
settled with common consent has been ever since kept in the strictest
duty



chapter viii


the king and queen make a progress to the frontiers  the author attends
them  the manner in which he leaves the country very particularly
related  he returns to england

i had always a strong impulse that i should some time recover my liberty
though it was impossible to conjecture by what means or to form any
project with the least hope of succeeding  the ship in which i sailed
was the first ever known to be driven within sight of that coast and the
king had given strict orders that if at any time another appeared it
should be taken ashore and with all its crew and passengers brought in a
tumbril to lorbrulgrud  he was strongly bent to get me a woman of my own
size by whom i might propagate the breed but i think i should rather
have died than undergone the disgrace of leaving a posterity to be kept
in cages like tame canary-birds and perhaps in time sold about the
kingdom to persons of quality for curiosities  i was indeed treated
with much kindness i was the favourite of a great king and queen and
the delight of the whole court but it was upon such a foot as ill became
the dignity of humankind  i could never forget those domestic pledges i
had left behind me  i wanted to be among people with whom i could
converse upon even terms and walk about the streets and fields without
being afraid of being trod to death like a frog or a young puppy  but my
deliverance came sooner than i expected and in a manner not very common
the whole story and circumstances of which i shall faithfully relate

i had now been two years in this country and about the beginning of the
third glumdalclitch and i attended the king and queen in a progress to
the south coast of the kingdom  i was carried as usual in my
travelling-box which as i have already described was a very convenient
closet of twelve feet wide  and i had ordered a hammock to be fixed by
silken ropes from the four corners at the top to break the jolts when a
servant carried me before him on horseback as i sometimes desired and
would often sleep in my hammock while we were upon the road  on the
roof of my closet not directly over the middle of the hammock i ordered
the joiner to cut out a hole of a foot square to give me air in hot
weather as i slept which hole i shut at pleasure with a board that drew
backward and forward through a groove

when we came to our journeys end the king thought proper to pass a few
days at a palace he has near flanflasnic a city within eighteen english
miles of the seaside  glumdalclitch and i were much fatigued i had
gotten a small cold but the poor girl was so ill as to be confined to
her chamber  i longed to see the ocean which must be the only scene of
my escape if ever it should happen  i pretended to be worse than i
really was and desired leave to take the fresh air of the sea with a
page whom i was very fond of and who had sometimes been trusted with
me  i shall never forget with what unwillingness glumdalclitch
consented nor the strict charge she gave the page to be careful of me
bursting at the same time into a flood of tears as if she had some
forboding of what was to happen  the boy took me out in my box about
half an hours walk from the palace towards the rocks on the sea-shore
i ordered him to set me down and lifting up one of my sashes cast many
a wistful melancholy look towards the sea  i found myself not very well
and told the page that i had a mind to take a nap in my hammock which i
hoped would do me good  i got in and the boy shut the window close
down to keep out the cold  i soon fell asleep and all i can conjecture
is while i slept the page thinking no danger could happen went among
the rocks to look for birds eggs having before observed him from my
window searching about and picking up one or two in the clefts  be that
as it will i found myself suddenly awaked with a violent pull upon the
ring which was fastened at the top of my box for the conveniency of
carriage  i felt my box raised very high in the air and then borne
forward with prodigious speed  the first jolt had like to have shaken me
out of my hammock but afterward the motion was easy enough  i called
out several times as loud as i could raise my voice but all to no
purpose  i looked towards my windows and could see nothing but the
clouds and sky  i heard a noise just over my head like the clapping of
wings and then began to perceive the woful condition i was in that some
eagle had got the ring of my box in his beak with an intent to let it
fall on a rock like a tortoise in a shell and then pick out my body
and devour it for the sagacity and smell of this bird enables him to
discover his quarry at a great distance though better concealed than i
could be within a two-inch board

in a little time i observed the noise and flutter of wings to increase
very fast and my box was tossed up and down like a sign in a windy day
i heard several bangs or buffets as i thought given to the eagle (for
such i am certain it must have been that held the ring of my box in his
beak) and then all on a sudden felt myself falling perpendicularly
down for above a minute but with such incredible swiftness that i
almost lost my breath  my fall was stopped by a terrible squash that
sounded louder to my ears than the cataract of niagara after which i
was quite in the dark for another minute and then my box began to rise
so high that i could see light from the tops of the windows  i now
perceived i was fallen into the sea  my box by the weight of my body
the goods that were in and the broad plates of iron fixed for strength
at the four corners of the top and bottom floated about five feet deep
in water  i did then and do now suppose that the eagle which flew away
with my box was pursued by two or three others and forced to let me
drop while he defended himself against the rest who hoped to share in
the prey  the plates of iron fastened at the bottom of the box (for
those were the strongest) preserved the balance while it fell and
hindered it from being broken on the surface of the water every joint of
it was well grooved and the door did not move on hinges but up and down
like a sash which kept my closet so tight that very little water came
in  i got with much difficulty out of my hammock having first ventured
to draw back the slip-board on the roof already mentioned contrived on
purpose to let in air for want of which i found myself almost stifled

how often did i then wish myself with my dear glumdalclitch from whom
one single hour had so far divided me  and i may say with truth that in
the midst of my own misfortunes i could not forbear lamenting my poor
nurse the grief she would suffer for my loss the displeasure of the
queen and the ruin of her fortune  perhaps many travellers have not
been under greater difficulties and distress than i was at this juncture
expecting every moment to see my box dashed to pieces or at least
overset by the first violent blast or rising wave  a breach in one
single pane of glass would have been immediate death nor could any thing
have preserved the windows but the strong lattice wires placed on the
outside against accidents in travelling  i saw the water ooze in at
several crannies although the leaks were not considerable and i
endeavoured to stop them as well as i could  i was not able to lift up
the roof of my closet which otherwise i certainly should have done and
sat on the top of it where i might at least preserve myself some hours
longer than by being shut up (as i may call it) in the hold  or if i
escaped these dangers for a day or two what could i expect but a
miserable death of cold and hunger?  i was four hours under these
circumstances expecting and indeed wishing every moment to be my last

i have already told the reader that there were two strong staples fixed
upon that side of my box which had no window and into which the servant
who used to carry me on horseback would put a leathern belt and buckle
it about his waist  being in this disconsolate state i heard or at
least thought i heard some kind of grating noise on that side of my box
where the staples were fixed and soon after i began to fancy that the
box was pulled or towed along the sea for i now and then felt a sort of
tugging which made the waves rise near the tops of my windows leaving
me almost in the dark  this gave me some faint hopes of relief although
i was not able to imagine how it could be brought about  i ventured to
unscrew one of my chairs which were always fastened to the floor and
having made a hard shift to screw it down again directly under the
slipping-board that i had lately opened i mounted on the chair and
putting my mouth as near as i could to the hole i called for help in a
loud voice and in all the languages i understood  i then fastened my
handkerchief to a stick i usually carried and thrusting it up the hole
waved it several times in the air that if any boat or ship were near
the seamen might conjecture some unhappy mortal to be shut up in the box

i found no effect from all i could do but plainly perceived my closet to
be moved along and in the space of an hour or better that side of the
box where the staples were and had no windows struck against something
that was hard  i apprehended it to be a rock and found myself tossed
more than ever  i plainly heard a noise upon the cover of my closet
like that of a cable and the grating of it as it passed through the
ring  i then found myself hoisted up by degrees at least three feet
higher than i was before  whereupon i again thrust up my stick and
handkerchief calling for help till i was almost hoarse  in return to
which i heard a great shout repeated three times giving me such
transports of joy as are not to be conceived but by those who feel them
i now heard a trampling over my head and somebody calling through the
hole with a loud voice in the english tongue “if there be any body
below let them speak”  i answered “i was an englishman drawn by ill
fortune into the greatest calamity that ever any creature underwent and
begged by all that was moving to be delivered out of the dungeon i was
in”  the voice replied “i was safe for my box was fastened to their
ship and the carpenter should immediately come and saw a hole in the
cover large enough to pull me out”  i answered “that was needless and
would take up too much time for there was no more to be done but let
one of the crew put his finger into the ring and take the box out of the
sea into the ship and so into the captains cabin”  some of them upon
hearing me talk so wildly thought i was mad others laughed for indeed
it never came into my head that i was now got among people of my own
stature and strength  the carpenter came and in a few minutes sawed a
passage about four feet square then let down a small ladder upon which
i mounted and thence was taken into the ship in a very weak condition

the sailors were all in amazement and asked me a thousand questions
which i had no inclination to answer  i was equally confounded at the
sight of so many pigmies for such i took them to be after having so
long accustomed mine eyes to the monstrous objects i had left  but the
captain mr thomas wilcocks an honest worthy shropshire man observing
i was ready to faint took me into his cabin gave me a cordial to
comfort me and made me turn in upon his own bed advising me to take a
little rest of which i had great need  before i went to sleep i gave
him to understand that i had some valuable furniture in my box too good
to be lost a fine hammock a handsome field-bed two chairs a table
and a cabinet that my closet was hung on all sides or rather quilted
with silk and cotton that if he would let one of the crew bring my
closet into his cabin i would open it there before him and show him my
goods  the captain hearing me utter these absurdities concluded i was
raving however (i suppose to pacify me) he promised to give order as i
desired and going upon deck sent some of his men down into my closet
whence (as i afterwards found) they drew up all my goods and stripped
off the quilting but the chairs cabinet and bedstead being screwed to
the floor were much damaged by the ignorance of the seamen who tore
them up by force  then they knocked off some of the boards for the use
of the ship and when they had got all they had a mind for let the hull
drop into the sea which by reason of many breaches made in the bottom
and sides sunk to rights  and indeed i was glad not to have been a
spectator of the havoc they made because i am confident it would have
sensibly touched me by bringing former passages into my mind which i
would rather have forgot

i slept some hours but perpetually disturbed with dreams of the place i
had left and the dangers i had escaped  however upon waking i found
myself much recovered  it was now about eight oclock at night and the
captain ordered supper immediately thinking i had already fasted too
long  he entertained me with great kindness observing me not to look
wildly or talk inconsistently and when we were left alone desired i
would give him a relation of my travels and by what accident i came to
be set adrift in that monstrous wooden chest  he said “that about
twelve oclock at noon as he was looking through his glass he spied it
at a distance and thought it was a sail which he had a mind to make
being not much out of his course in hopes of buying some biscuit his
own beginning to fall short  that upon coming nearer and finding his
error he sent out his long-boat to discover what it was that his men
came back in a fright swearing they had seen a swimming house  that he
laughed at their folly and went himself in the boat ordering his men to
take a strong cable along with them  that the weather being calm he
rowed round me several times observed my windows and wire lattices that
defended them  that he discovered two staples upon one side which was
all of boards without any passage for light  he then commanded his men
to row up to that side and fastening a cable to one of the staples
ordered them to tow my chest as they called it toward the ship  when
it was there he gave directions to fasten another cable to the ring
fixed in the cover and to raise up my chest with pulleys which all the
sailors were not able to do above two or three feet”  he said “they saw
my stick and handkerchief thrust out of the hole and concluded that some
unhappy man must be shut up in the cavity”  i asked “whether he or the
crew had seen any prodigious birds in the air about the time he first
discovered me”  to which he answered “that discoursing this matter with
the sailors while i was asleep one of them said he had observed three
eagles flying towards the north but remarked nothing of their being
larger than the usual size” which i suppose must be imputed to the great
height they were at and he could not guess the reason of my question  i
then asked the captain “how far he reckoned we might be from land?”  he
said “by the best computation he could make we were at least a hundred
leagues”  i assured him “that he must be mistaken by almost half for i
had not left the country whence i came above two hours before i dropped
into the sea”  whereupon he began again to think that my brain was
disturbed of which he gave me a hint and advised me to go to bed in a
cabin he had provided  i assured him “i was well refreshed with his
good entertainment and company and as much in my senses as ever i was in
my life”  he then grew serious and desired to ask me freely “whether i
were not troubled in my mind by the consciousness of some enormous crime
for which i was punished at the command of some prince by exposing me
in that chest as great criminals in other countries have been forced
to sea in a leaky vessel without provisions for although he should be
sorry to have taken so ill a man into his ship yet he would engage his
word to set me safe ashore in the first port where we arrived”  he
added “that his suspicions were much increased by some very absurd
speeches i had delivered at first to his sailors and afterwards to
himself in relation to my closet or chest as well as by my odd looks
and behaviour while i was at supper”

i begged his patience to hear me tell my story which i faithfully did
from the last time i left england to the moment he first discovered me
and as truth always forces its way into rational minds so this honest
worthy gentleman who had some tincture of learning and very good sense
was immediately convinced of my candour and veracity  but further to
confirm all i had said i entreated him to give order that my cabinet
should be brought of which i had the key in my pocket for he had
already informed me how the seamen disposed of my closet  i opened it in
his own presence and showed him the small collection of rarities i made
in the country from which i had been so strangely delivered  there was
the comb i had contrived out of the stumps of the kings beard and
another of the same materials but fixed into a paring of her majestys
thumb-nail which served for the back  there was a collection of needles
and pins from a foot to half a yard long four wasp stings like
joiners tacks some combings of the queens hair a gold ring which one
day she made me a present of in a most obliging manner taking it from
her little finger and throwing it over my head like a collar  i desired
the captain would please to accept this ring in return for his
civilities which he absolutely refused  i showed him a corn that i had
cut off with my own hand from a maid of honours toe it was about the
bigness of kentish pippin and grown so hard that when i returned
england i got it hollowed into a cup and set in silver  lastly i
desired him to see the breeches i had then on which were made of a
mouses skin

i could force nothing on him but a footmans tooth which i observed him
to examine with great curiosity and found he had a fancy for it  he
received it with abundance of thanks more than such a trifle could
deserve  it was drawn by an unskilful surgeon in a mistake from one of
glumdalclitchs men who was afflicted with the tooth-ache but it was as
sound as any in his head  i got it cleaned and put it into my cabinet
it was about a foot long and four inches in diameter

the captain was very well satisfied with this plain relation i had given
him and said “he hoped when we returned to england i would oblige the
world by putting it on paper and making it public”  my answer was
“that we were overstocked with books of travels that nothing could now
pass which was not extraordinary wherein i doubted some authors less
consulted truth than their own vanity or interest or the diversion of
ignorant readers that my story could contain little beside common
events without those ornamental descriptions of strange plants trees
birds and other animals or of the barbarous customs and idolatry of
savage people with which most writers abound  however i thanked him
for his good opinion and promised to take the matter into my thoughts”

he said “he wondered at one thing very much which was to hear me speak
so loud” asking me “whether the king or queen of that country were thick
of hearing?”  i told him “it was what i had been used to for above two
years past and that i admired as much at the voices of him and his men
who seemed to me only to whisper and yet i could hear them well enough
but when i spoke in that country it was like a man talking in the
streets to another looking out from the top of a steeple unless when i
was placed on a table or held in any persons hand”  i told him “i had
likewise observed another thing that when i first got into the ship
and the sailors stood all about me i thought they were the most little
contemptible creatures i had ever beheld”  for indeed while i was in
that princes country i could never endure to look in a glass after
mine eyes had been accustomed to such prodigious objects because the
comparison gave me so despicable a conceit of myself  the captain said
“that while we were at supper he observed me to look at every thing with
a sort of wonder and that i often seemed hardly able to contain my
laughter which he knew not well how to take but imputed it to some
disorder in my brain”  i answered “it was very true and i wondered how
i could forbear when i saw his dishes of the size of a silver
three-pence a leg of pork hardly a mouthful a cup not so big as a
nut-shell” and so i went on describing the rest of his household-stuff
and provisions after the same manner  for although he queen had
ordered a little equipage of all things necessary for me while i was in
her service yet my ideas were wholly taken up with what i saw on every
side of me and i winked at my own littleness as people do at their own
faults  the captain understood my raillery very well and merrily
replied with the old english proverb “that he doubted mine eyes were
bigger than my belly for he did not observe my stomach so good although
i had fasted all day” and continuing in his mirth protested “he would
have gladly given a hundred pounds to have seen my closet in the eagles
bill and afterwards in its fall from so great a height into the sea
which would certainly have been a most astonishing object worthy to have
the description of it transmitted to future ages” and the comparison of
phaëton was so obvious that he could not forbear applying it although i
did not much admire the conceit

the captain having been at tonquin was in his return to england driven
north-eastward to the latitude of 44 degrees and longitude of 143  but
meeting a trade-wind two days after i came on board him we sailed
southward a long time and coasting new holland kept our course
west-south-west and then south-south-west till we doubled the cape of
good hope  our voyage was very prosperous but i shall not trouble the
reader with a journal of it  the captain called in at one or two ports
and sent in his long-boat for provisions and fresh water but i never
went out of the ship till we came into the downs which was on the third
day of june 1706 about nine months after my escape  i offered to leave
my goods in security for payment of my freight but the captain protested
he would not receive one farthing  we took a kind leave of each other
and i made him promise he would come to see me at my house in redriff  i
hired a horse and guide for five shillings which i borrowed of the
captain

as i was on the road observing the littleness of the houses the trees
the cattle and the people i began to think myself in lilliput  i was
afraid of trampling on every traveller i met and often called aloud to
have them stand out of the way so that i had like to have gotten one or
two broken heads for my impertinence

when i came to my own house for which i was forced to inquire one of
the servants opening the door i bent down to go in (like a goose under
a gate) for fear of striking my head  my wife run out to embrace me
but i stooped lower than her knees thinking she could otherwise never be
able to reach my mouth  my daughter kneeled to ask my blessing but i
could not see her till she arose having been so long used to stand with
my head and eyes erect to above sixty feet and then i went to take her
up with one hand by the waist  i looked down upon the servants and one
or two friends who were in the house as if they had been pigmies and i a
giant  i told my wife “she had been too thrifty for i found she had
starved herself and her daughter to nothing”  in short i behaved myself
so unaccountably that they were all of the captains opinion when he
first saw me and concluded i had lost my wits  this i mention as an
instance of the great power of habit and prejudice

in a little time i and my family and friends came to a right
understanding but my wife protested “i should never go to sea any more”
although my evil destiny so ordered that she had not power to hinder me
as the reader may know hereafter  in the mean time i here conclude the
second part of my unfortunate voyages




part iii  a voyage to laputa balnibarbi luggnagg glubbdubdrib and
japan


chapter i


the author sets out on his third voyage  is taken by pirates  the
malice of a dutchman  his arrival at an island  he is received into
laputa

i had not been at home above ten days when captain william robinson a
cornish man commander of the hopewell a stout ship of three hundred
tons came to my house  i had formerly been surgeon of another ship
where he was master and a fourth part owner in a voyage to the levant
he had always treated me more like a brother than an inferior officer
and hearing of my arrival made me a visit as i apprehended only out of
friendship for nothing passed more than what is usual after long
absences  but repeating his visits often expressing his joy to find i
me in good health asking “whether i were now settled for life?” adding
“that he intended a voyage to the east indies in two months” at last he
plainly invited me though with some apologies to be surgeon of the
ship “that i should have another surgeon under me beside our two mates
that my salary should be double to the usual pay and that having
experienced my knowledge in sea-affairs to be at least equal to his he
would enter into any engagement to follow my advice as much as if i had
shared in the command”

he said so many other obliging things and i knew him to be so honest a
man that i could not reject this proposal the thirst i had of seeing
the world notwithstanding my past misfortunes continuing as violent as
ever  the only difficulty that remained was to persuade my wife whose
consent however i at last obtained by the prospect of advantage she
proposed to her children

we set out the 5th day of august 1706 and arrived at fort st george
the 11th of april 1707  we staid there three weeks to refresh our crew
many of whom were sick  from thence we went to tonquin where the
captain resolved to continue some time because many of the goods he
intended to buy were not ready nor could he expect to be dispatched in
several months  therefore in hopes to defray some of the charges he
must be at he bought a sloop loaded it with several sorts of goods
wherewith the tonquinese usually trade to the neighbouring islands and
putting fourteen men on board whereof three were of the country he
appointed me master of the sloop and gave me power to traffic while he
transacted his affairs at tonquin

we had not sailed above three days when a great storm arising we were
driven five days to the north-north-east and then to the east after
which we had fair weather but still with a pretty strong gale from the
west  upon the tenth day we were chased by two pirates who soon
overtook us for my sloop was so deep laden that she sailed very slow
neither were we in a condition to defend ourselves

we were boarded about the same time by both the pirates who entered
furiously at the head of their men but finding us all prostrate upon our
faces (for so i gave order) they pinioned us with strong ropes and
setting guard upon us went to search the sloop

i observed among them a dutchman who seemed to be of some authority
though he was not commander of either ship  he knew us by our
countenances to be englishmen and jabbering to us in his own language
swore we should be tied back to back and thrown into the sea  i spoke
dutch tolerably well i told him who we were and begged him in
consideration of our being christians and protestants of neighbouring
countries in strict alliance that he would move the captains to take
some pity on us  this inflamed his rage he repeated his threatenings
and turning to his companions spoke with great vehemence in the japanese
language as i suppose often using the word christianos

the largest of the two pirate ships was commanded by a japanese captain
who spoke a little dutch but very imperfectly  he came up to me and
after several questions which i answered in great humility he said “we
should not die”  i made the captain a very low bow and then turning to
the dutchman said “i was sorry to find more mercy in a heathen than in
a brother christian”  but i had soon reason to repent those foolish
words for that malicious reprobate having often endeavoured in vain to
persuade both the captains that i might be thrown into the sea (which
they would not yield to after the promise made me that i should not
die) however prevailed so far as to have a punishment inflicted on me
worse in all human appearance than death itself  my men were sent by
an equal division into both the pirate ships and my sloop new manned
as to myself it was determined that i should be set adrift in a small
canoe with paddles and a sail and four days provisions which last
the japanese captain was so kind to double out of his own stores and
would permit no man to search me  i got down into the canoe while the
dutchman standing upon the deck loaded me with all the curses and
injurious terms his language could afford

about an hour before we saw the pirates i had taken an observation and
found we were in the latitude of 46 n and longitude of 183  when i was
at some distance from the pirates i discovered by my pocket-glass
several islands to the south-east  i set up my sail the wind being
fair with a design to reach the nearest of those islands which i made a
shift to do in about three hours  it was all rocky however i got many
birds eggs and striking fire i kindled some heath and dry sea-weed
by which i roasted my eggs  i ate no other supper being resolved to
spare my provisions as much as i could  i passed the night under the
shelter of a rock strewing some heath under me and slept pretty well

the next day i sailed to another island and thence to a third and
fourth sometimes using my sail and sometimes my paddles  but not to
trouble the reader with a particular account of my distresses let it
suffice that on the fifth day i arrived at the last island in my sight
which lay south-south-east to the former

this island was at a greater distance than i expected and i did not
reach it in less than five hours  i encompassed it almost round before
i could find a convenient place to land in which was a small creek
about three times the wideness of my canoe  i found the island to be all
rocky only a little intermingled with tufts of grass and sweet-smelling
herbs  i took out my small provisions and after having refreshed myself
i secured the remainder in a cave whereof there were great numbers i
gathered plenty of eggs upon the rocks and got a quantity of dry
sea-weed and parched grass which i designed to kindle the next day and
roast my eggs as well as i could for i had about me my flint steel
match and burning-glass  i lay all night in the cave where i had lodged
my provisions  my bed was the same dry grass and sea-weed which i
intended for fuel  i slept very little for the disquiets of my mind
prevailed over my weariness and kept me awake  i considered how
impossible it was to preserve my life in so desolate a place and how
miserable my end must be yet found myself so listless and desponding
that i had not the heart to rise and before i could get spirits enough
to creep out of my cave the day was far advanced  i walked awhile among
the rocks the sky was perfectly clear and the sun so hot that i was
forced to turn my face from it when all on a sudden it became obscure
as i thought in a manner very different from what happens by the
interposition of a cloud  i turned back and perceived a vast opaque
body between me and the sun moving forwards towards the island it seemed
to be about two miles high and hid the sun six or seven minutes but i
did not observe the air to be much colder or the sky more darkened than
if i had stood under the shade of a mountain  as it approached nearer
over the place where i was it appeared to be a firm substance the
bottom flat smooth and shining very bright from the reflection of the
sea below  i stood upon a height about two hundred yards from the shore
and saw this vast body descending almost to a parallel with me at less
than an english mile distance  i took out my pocket perspective and
could plainly discover numbers of people moving up and down the sides of
it which appeared to be sloping but what those people where doing i was
not able to distinguish

the natural love of life gave me some inward motion of joy and i was
ready to entertain a hope that this adventure might some way or other
help to deliver me from the desolate place and condition i was in  but
at the same time the reader can hardly conceive my astonishment to
behold an island in the air inhabited by men who were able (as it
should seem) to raise or sink or put it into progressive motion as they
pleased  but not being at that time in a disposition to philosophise
upon this phenomenon i rather chose to observe what course the island
would take because it seemed for awhile to stand still  yet soon after
it advanced nearer and i could see the sides of it encompassed with
several gradations of galleries and stairs at certain intervals to
descend from one to the other  in the lowest gallery i beheld some
people fishing with long angling rods and others looking on  i waved my
cap (for my hat was long since worn out) and my handkerchief toward the
island and upon its nearer approach i called and shouted with the
utmost strength of my voice and then looking circumspectly i beheld a
crowd gather to that side which was most in my view  i found by their
pointing towards me and to each other that they plainly discovered me
although they made no return to my shouting  but i could see four or
five men running in great haste up the stairs to the top of the island
who then disappeared  i happened rightly to conjecture that these were
sent for orders to some person in authority upon this occasion

the number of people increased and in less than half an hour the
island was moved and raised in such a manner that the lowest gallery
appeared in a parallel of less then a hundred yards distance from the
height where i stood  i then put myself in the most supplicating
posture and spoke in the humblest accent but received no answer  those
who stood nearest over against me seemed to be persons of distinction
as i supposed by their habit  they conferred earnestly with each other
looking often upon me  at length one of them called out in a clear
polite smooth dialect not unlike in sound to the italian and therefore
i returned an answer in that language hoping at least that the cadence
might be more agreeable to his ears  although neither of us understood
the other yet my meaning was easily known for the people saw the
distress i was in

they made signs for me to come down from the rock and go towards the
shore which i accordingly did and the flying island being raised to a
convenient height the verge directly over me a chain was let down from
the lowest gallery with a seat fastened to the bottom to which i fixed
myself and was drawn up by pulleys



chapter ii


the humours and dispositions of the laputians described  an account of
their learning  of the king and his court  the authors reception
there  the inhabitants subject to fear and disquietudes  an account of
the women

at my alighting i was surrounded with a crowd of people but those who
stood nearest seemed to be of better quality  they beheld me with all
the marks and circumstances of wonder neither indeed was i much in their
debt having never till then seen a race of mortals so singular in their
shapes habits and countenances  their heads were all reclined either
to the right or the left one of their eyes turned inward and the other
directly up to the zenith  their outward garments were adorned with the
figures of suns moons and stars interwoven with those of fiddles
flutes harps trumpets guitars harpsichords and many other
instruments of music unknown to us in europe  i observed here and
there many in the habit of servants with a blown bladder fastened like
a flail to the end of a stick which they carried in their hands  in
each bladder was a small quantity of dried peas or little pebbles as i
was afterwards informed  with these bladders they now and then flapped
the mouths and ears of those who stood near them of which practice i
could not then conceive the meaning  it seems the minds of these people
are so taken up with intense speculations that they neither can speak
nor attend to the discourses of others without being roused by some
external action upon the organs of speech and hearing for which reason
those persons who are able to afford it always keep a flapper (the
original is climenole) in their family as one of their domestics nor
ever walk abroad or make visits without him  and the business of this
officer is when two three or more persons are in company gently to
strike with his bladder the mouth of him who is to speak and the right
ear of him or them to whom the speaker addresses himself  this flapper
is likewise employed diligently to attend his master in his walks and
upon occasion to give him a soft flap on his eyes because he is always
so wrapped up in cogitation that he is in manifest danger of falling
down every precipice and bouncing his head against every post and in
the streets of justling others or being justled himself into the
kennel

it was necessary to give the reader this information without which he
would be at the same loss with me to understand the proceedings of these
people as they conducted me up the stairs to the top of the island and
from thence to the royal palace  while we were ascending they forgot
several times what they were about and left me to myself till their
memories were again roused by their flappers for they appeared
altogether unmoved by the sight of my foreign habit and countenance and
by the shouts of the vulgar whose thoughts and minds were more
disengaged

at last we entered the palace and proceeded into the chamber of
presence where i saw the king seated on his throne attended on each
side by persons of prime quality  before the throne was a large table
filled with globes and spheres and mathematical instruments of all
kinds  his majesty took not the least notice of us although our
entrance was not without sufficient noise by the concourse of all
persons belonging to the court  but he was then deep in a problem and
we attended at least an hour before he could solve it  there stood by
him on each side a young page with flaps in their hands and when they
saw he was at leisure one of them gently struck his mouth and the other
his right ear at which he startled like one awaked on the sudden and
looking towards me and the company i was in recollected the occasion of
our coming whereof he had been informed before  he spoke some words
whereupon immediately a young man with a flap came up to my side and
flapped me gently on the right ear but i made signs as well as i could
that i had no occasion for such an instrument which as i afterwards
found gave his majesty and the whole court a very mean opinion of my
understanding  the king as far as i could conjecture asked me several
questions and i addressed myself to him in all the languages i had
when it was found i could neither understand nor be understood i was
conducted by his order to an apartment in his palace (this prince being
distinguished above all his predecessors for his hospitality to
strangers) where two servants were appointed to attend me  my dinner
was brought and four persons of quality whom i remembered to have seen
very near the kings person did me the honour to dine with me  we had
two courses of three dishes each  in the first course there was a
shoulder of mutton cut into an equilateral triangle a piece of beef into
a rhomboides and a pudding into a cycloid  the second course was two
ducks trussed up in the form of fiddles sausages and puddings resembling
flutes and hautboys and a breast of veal in the shape of a harp  the
servants cut our bread into cones cylinders parallelograms and several
other mathematical figures

while we were at dinner i made bold to ask the names of several things
in their language and those noble persons by the assistance of their
flappers delighted to give me answers hoping to raise my admiration of
their great abilities if i could be brought to converse with them  i was
soon able to call for bread and drink or whatever else i wanted

after dinner my company withdrew and a person was sent to me by the
kings order attended by a flapper  he brought with him pen ink and
paper and three or four books giving me to understand by signs that he
was sent to teach me the language  we sat together four hours in which
time i wrote down a great number of words in columns with the
translations over against them i likewise made a shift to learn several
short sentences for my tutor would order one of my servants to fetch
something to turn about to make a bow to sit or to stand or walk
and the like  then i took down the sentence in writing  he showed me
also in one of his books the figures of the sun moon and stars the
zodiac the tropics and polar circles together with the denominations
of many plains and solids  he gave me the names and descriptions of all
the musical instruments and the general terms of art in playing on each
of them  after he had left me i placed all my words with their
interpretations in alphabetical order  and thus in a few days by the
help of a very faithful memory i got some insight into their language
the word which i interpret the flying or floating island is in the
original laputa whereof i could never learn the true etymology
lap in the old obsolete language signifies high and untuh a
governor from which they say by corruption was derived laputa from
lapuntuh  but i do not approve of this derivation which seems to be a
little strained  i ventured to offer to the learned among them a
conjecture of my own that laputa was quasi lap outed lap
signifying properly the dancing of the sunbeams in the sea and outed
a wing which however i shall not obtrude but submit to the judicious
reader

those to whom the king had entrusted me observing how ill i was clad
ordered a tailor to come next morning and take measure for a suit of
clothes  this operator did his office after a different manner from
those of his trade in europe  he first took my altitude by a quadrant
and then with a rule and compasses described the dimensions and
outlines of my whole body all which he entered upon paper and in six
days brought my clothes very ill made and quite out of shape by
happening to mistake a figure in the calculation  but my comfort was
that i observed such accidents very frequent and little regarded

during my confinement for want of clothes and by an indisposition that
held me some days longer i much enlarged my dictionary and when i went
next to court was able to understand many things the king spoke and to
return him some kind of answers  his majesty had given orders that the
island should move north-east and by east to the vertical point over
lagado the metropolis of the whole kingdom below upon the firm earth
it was about ninety leagues distant and our voyage lasted four days and
a half  i was not in the least sensible of the progressive motion made
in the air by the island  on the second morning about eleven oclock
the king himself in person attended by his nobility courtiers and
officers having prepared all their musical instruments played on them
for three hours without intermission so that i was quite stunned with
the noise neither could i possibly guess the meaning till my tutor
informed me  he said that the people of their island had their ears
adapted to hear “the music of the spheres which always played at certain
periods and the court was now prepared to bear their part in whatever
instrument they most excelled”

in our journey towards lagado the capital city his majesty ordered that
the island should stop over certain towns and villages from whence he
might receive the petitions of his subjects  and to this purpose
several packthreads were let down with small weights at the bottom  on
these packthreads the people strung their petitions which mounted up
directly like the scraps of paper fastened by school boys at the end of
the string that holds their kite  sometimes we received wine and
victuals from below which were drawn up by pulleys

the knowledge i had in mathematics gave me great assistance in acquiring
their phraseology which depended much upon that science and music and
in the latter i was not unskilled  their ideas are perpetually
conversant in lines and figures  if they would for example praise the
beauty of a woman or any other animal they describe it by rhombs
circles parallelograms ellipses and other geometrical terms or by
words of art drawn from music needless here to repeat  i observed in
the kings kitchen all sorts of mathematical and musical instruments
after the figures of which they cut up the joints that were served to his
majestys table

their houses are very ill built the walls bevil without one right angle
in any apartment and this defect arises from the contempt they bear to
practical geometry which they despise as vulgar and mechanic those
instructions they give being too refined for the intellects of their
workmen which occasions perpetual mistakes  and although they are
dexterous enough upon a piece of paper in the management of the rule
the pencil and the divider yet in the common actions and behaviour of
life i have not seen a more clumsy awkward and unhandy people nor so
slow and perplexed in their conceptions upon all other subjects except
those of mathematics and music  they are very bad reasoners and
vehemently given to opposition unless when they happen to be of the
right opinion which is seldom their case  imagination fancy and
invention they are wholly strangers to nor have any words in their
language by which those ideas can be expressed the whole compass of
their thoughts and mind being shut up within the two forementioned
sciences

most of them and especially those who deal in the astronomical part
have great faith in judicial astrology although they are ashamed to own
it publicly  but what i chiefly admired and thought altogether
unaccountable was the strong disposition i observed in them towards news
and politics perpetually inquiring into public affairs giving their
judgments in matters of state and passionately disputing every inch of a
party opinion  i have indeed observed the same disposition among most of
the mathematicians i have known in europe although i could never
discover the least analogy between the two sciences unless those people
suppose that because the smallest circle has as many degrees as the
largest therefore the regulation and management of the world require no
more abilities than the handling and turning of a globe but i rather
take this quality to spring from a very common infirmity of human nature
inclining us to be most curious and conceited in matters where we have
least concern and for which we are least adapted by study or nature

these people are under continual disquietudes never enjoying a minutes
peace of mind and their disturbances proceed from causes which very
little affect the rest of mortals  their apprehensions arise from
several changes they dread in the celestial bodies for instance that
the earth by the continual approaches of the sun towards it must in
course of time be absorbed or swallowed up that the face of the sun
will by degrees be encrusted with its own effluvia and give no more
light to the world that the earth very narrowly escaped a brush from the
tail of the last comet which would have infallibly reduced it to ashes
and that the next which they have calculated for one-and-thirty years
hence will probably destroy us  for if in its perihelion it should
approach within a certain degree of the sun (as by their calculations
they have reason to dread) it will receive a degree of heat ten thousand
times more intense than that of red hot glowing iron and in its absence
from the sun carry a blazing tail ten hundred thousand and fourteen
miles long through which if the earth should pass at the distance of
one hundred thousand miles from the nucleus or main body of the comet
it must in its passage be set on fire and reduced to ashes that the
sun daily spending its rays without any nutriment to supply them will
at last be wholly consumed and annihilated which must be attended with
the destruction of this earth and of all the planets that receive their
light from it

they are so perpetually alarmed with the apprehensions of these and the
like impending dangers that they can neither sleep quietly in their
beds nor have any relish for the common pleasures and amusements of
life  when they meet an acquaintance in the morning the first question
is about the suns health how he looked at his setting and rising and
what hopes they have to avoid the stroke of the approaching comet  this
conversation they are apt to run into with the same temper that boys
discover in delighting to hear terrible stories of spirits and
hobgoblins which they greedily listen to and dare not go to bed for
fear

the women of the island have abundance of vivacity they contemn their
husbands and are exceedingly fond of strangers whereof there is always
a considerable number from the continent below attending at court
either upon affairs of the several towns and corporations or their own
particular occasions but are much despised because they want the same
endowments  among these the ladies choose their gallants but the
vexation is that they act with too much ease and security for the
husband is always so rapt in speculation that the mistress and lover may
proceed to the greatest familiarities before his face if he be but
provided with paper and implements and without his flapper at his side

the wives and daughters lament their confinement to the island although
i think it the most delicious spot of ground in the world and although
they live here in the greatest plenty and magnificence and are allowed
to do whatever they please they long to see the world and take the
diversions of the metropolis which they are not allowed to do without a
particular license from the king and this is not easy to be obtained
because the people of quality have found by frequent experience how
hard it is to persuade their women to return from below  i was told that
a great court lady who had several children—is married to the prime
minister the richest subject in the kingdom a very graceful person
extremely fond of her and lives in the finest palace of the island—went
down to lagado on the pretence of health there hid herself for several
months till the king sent a warrant to search for her and she was found
in an obscure eating-house all in rags having pawned her clothes to
maintain an old deformed footman who beat her every day and in whose
company she was taken much against her will  and although her husband
received her with all possible kindness and without the least reproach
she soon after contrived to steal down again with all her jewels to the
same gallant and has not been heard of since

this may perhaps pass with the reader rather for an european or english
story than for one of a country so remote  but he may please to
consider that the caprices of womankind are not limited by any climate
or nation and that they are much more uniform than can be easily
imagined

in about a months time i had made a tolerable proficiency in their
language and was able to answer most of the kings questions when i had
the honour to attend him  his majesty discovered not the least curiosity
to inquire into the laws government history religion or manners of
the countries where i had been but confined his questions to the state
of mathematics and received the account i gave him with great contempt
and indifference though often roused by his flapper on each side



chapter iii


a phenomenon solved by modern philosophy and astronomy  the laputians
great improvements in the latter  the kings method of suppressing
insurrections

i desired leave of this prince to see the curiosities of the island
which he was graciously pleased to grant and ordered my tutor to attend
me  i chiefly wanted to know to what cause in art or in nature it
owed its several motions whereof i will now give a philosophical account
to the reader

the flying or floating island is exactly circular its diameter 7837
yards or about four miles and a half and consequently contains ten
thousand acres  it is three hundred yards thick  the bottom or under
surface which appears to those who view it below is one even regular
plate of adamant shooting up to the height of about two hundred yards
above it lie the several minerals in their usual order and over all is a
coat of rich mould ten or twelve feet deep  the declivity of the upper
surface from the circumference to the centre is the natural cause why
all the dews and rains which fall upon the island are conveyed in small
rivulets toward the middle where they are emptied into four large
basins each of about half a mile in circuit and two hundred yards
distant from the centre  from these basins the water is continually
exhaled by the sun in the daytime which effectually prevents their
overflowing  besides as it is in the power of the monarch to raise the
island above the region of clouds and vapours he can prevent the falling
of dews and rain whenever he pleases  for the highest clouds cannot rise
above two miles as naturalists agree at least they were never known to
do so in that country

at the centre of the island there is a chasm about fifty yards in
diameter whence the astronomers descend into a large dome which is
therefore called flandona gagnole or the astronomers cave situated
at the depth of a hundred yards beneath the upper surface of the adamant
in this cave are twenty lamps continually burning which from the
reflection of the adamant cast a strong light into every part  the
place is stored with great variety of sextants quadrants telescopes
astrolabes and other astronomical instruments  but the greatest
curiosity upon which the fate of the island depends is a loadstone of a
prodigious size in shape resembling a weavers shuttle  it is in length
six yards and in the thickest part at least three yards over  this
magnet is sustained by a very strong axle of adamant passing through its
middle upon which it plays and is poised so exactly that the weakest
hand can turn it  it is hooped round with a hollow cylinder of adamant
four feet yards in diameter placed horizontally and supported by eight
adamantine feet each six yards high  in the middle of the concave side
there is a groove twelve inches deep in which the extremities of the
axle are lodged and turned round as there is occasion

the stone cannot be removed from its place by any force because the hoop
and its feet are one continued piece with that body of adamant which
constitutes the bottom of the island

by means of this loadstone the island is made to rise and fall and move
from one place to another  for with respect to that part of the earth
over which the monarch presides the stone is endued at one of its sides
with an attractive power and at the other with a repulsive  upon
placing the magnet erect with its attracting end towards the earth the
island descends but when the repelling extremity points downwards the
island mounts directly upwards  when the position of the stone is
oblique the motion of the island is so too for in this magnet the
forces always act in lines parallel to its direction

by this oblique motion the island is conveyed to different parts of the
monarchs dominions  to explain the manner of its progress let a b
represent a line drawn across the dominions of balnibarbi let the line
c d represent the loadstone of which let d be the repelling end
and c the attracting end the island being over c let the stone be
placed in position c d with its repelling end downwards then the
island will be driven upwards obliquely towards d  when it is arrived
at d let the stone be turned upon its axle till its attracting end
points towards e and then the island will be carried obliquely towards
e where if the stone be again turned upon its axle till it stands in
the position e f with its repelling point downwards the island will
rise obliquely towards f where by directing the attracting end
towards g the island may be carried to g and from g to h by
turning the stone so as to make its repelling extremity to point
directly downward  and thus by changing the situation of the stone as
often as there is occasion the island is made to rise and fall by turns
in an oblique direction and by those alternate risings and fallings (the
obliquity being not considerable) is conveyed from one part of the
dominions to the other

but it must be observed that this island cannot move beyond the extent
of the dominions below nor can it rise above the height of four miles
for which the astronomers (who have written large systems concerning the
stone) assign the following reason that the magnetic virtue does not
extend beyond the distance of four miles and that the mineral which
acts upon the stone in the bowels of the earth and in the sea about six
leagues distant from the shore is not diffused through the whole globe
but terminated with the limits of the kings dominions and it was easy
from the great advantage of such a superior situation for a prince to
bring under his obedience whatever country lay within the attraction of
that magnet

when the stone is put parallel to the plane of the horizon the island
stands still for in that case the extremities of it being at equal
distance from the earth act with equal force the one in drawing
downwards the other in pushing upwards and consequently no motion can
ensue

this loadstone is under the care of certain astronomers who from time
to time give it such positions as the monarch directs  they spend the
greatest part of their lives in observing the celestial bodies which
they do by the assistance of glasses far excelling ours in goodness
for although their largest telescopes do not exceed three feet they
magnify much more than those of a hundred with us and show the stars
with greater clearness  this advantage has enabled them to extend their
discoveries much further than our astronomers in europe for they have
made a catalogue of ten thousand fixed stars whereas the largest of ours
do not contain above one third part of that number  they have likewise
discovered two lesser stars or satellites which revolve about mars
whereof the innermost is distant from the centre of the primary planet
exactly three of his diameters and the outermost five the former
revolves in the space of ten hours and the latter in twenty-one and a
half so that the squares of their periodical times are very near in the
same proportion with the cubes of their distance from the centre of mars
which evidently shows them to be governed by the same law of gravitation
that influences the other heavenly bodies

they have observed ninety-three different comets and settled their
periods with great exactness  if this be true (and they affirm it with
great confidence) it is much to be wished that their observations were
made public whereby the theory of comets which at present is very lame
and defective might be brought to the same perfection with other arts of
astronomy

the king would be the most absolute prince in the universe if he could
but prevail on a ministry to join with him but these having their
estates below on the continent and considering that the office of a
favourite has a very uncertain tenure would never consent to the
enslaving of their country

if any town should engage in rebellion or mutiny fall into violent
factions or refuse to pay the usual tribute the king has two methods of
reducing them to obedience  the first and the mildest course is by
keeping the island hovering over such a town and the lands about it
whereby he can deprive them of the benefit of the sun and the rain and
consequently afflict the inhabitants with dearth and diseases and if the
crime deserve it they are at the same time pelted from above with great
stones against which they have no defence but by creeping into cellars
or caves while the roofs of their houses are beaten to pieces  but if
they still continue obstinate or offer to raise insurrections he
proceeds to the last remedy by letting the island drop directly upon
their heads which makes a universal destruction both of houses and men
however this is an extremity to which the prince is seldom driven
neither indeed is he willing to put it in execution nor dare his
ministers advise him to an action which as it would render them odious
to the people so it would be a great damage to their own estates which
all lie below for the island is the kings demesne

but there is still indeed a more weighty reason why the kings of this
country have been always averse from executing so terrible an action
unless upon the utmost necessity  for if the town intended to be
destroyed should have in it any tall rocks as it generally falls out in
the larger cities a situation probably chosen at first with a view to
prevent such a catastrophe or if it abound in high spires or pillars of
stone a sudden fall might endanger the bottom or under surface of the
island which although it consist as i have said of one entire
adamant two hundred yards thick might happen to crack by too great a
shock or burst by approaching too near the fires from the houses below
as the backs both of iron and stone will often do in our chimneys  of
all this the people are well apprised and understand how far to carry
their obstinacy where their liberty or property is concerned  and the
king when he is highest provoked and most determined to press a city to
rubbish orders the island to descend with great gentleness out of a
pretence of tenderness to his people but indeed for fear of breaking
the adamantine bottom in which case it is the opinion of all their
philosophers that the loadstone could no longer hold it up and the
whole mass would fall to the ground

by a fundamental law of this realm neither the king nor either of his
two eldest sons are permitted to leave the island nor the queen till
she is past child-bearing



chapter iv


the author leaves laputa is conveyed to balnibarbi arrives at the
metropolis  a description of the metropolis and the country adjoining
the author hospitably received by a great lord  his conversation with
that lord

although i cannot say that i was ill treated in this island yet i must
confess i thought myself too much neglected not without some degree of
contempt for neither prince nor people appeared to be curious in any
part of knowledge except mathematics and music wherein i was far their
inferior and upon that account very little regarded

on the other side after having seen all the curiosities of the island i
was very desirous to leave it being heartily weary of those people
they were indeed excellent in two sciences for which i have great esteem
and wherein i am not unversed but at the same time so abstracted and
involved in speculation that i never met with such disagreeable
companions  i conversed only with women tradesmen flappers and
court-pages during two months of my abode there by which at last i
rendered myself extremely contemptible yet these were the only people
from whom i could ever receive a reasonable answer

i had obtained by hard study a good degree of knowledge in their
language i was weary of being confined to an island where i received so
little countenance and resolved to leave it with the first opportunity

there was a great lord at court nearly related to the king and for that
reason alone used with respect  he was universally reckoned the most
ignorant and stupid person among them  he had performed many eminent
services for the crown had great natural and acquired parts adorned
with integrity and honour but so ill an ear for music that his
detractors reported “he had been often known to beat time in the wrong
place” neither could his tutors without extreme difficulty teach him
to demonstrate the most easy proposition in the mathematics  he was
pleased to show me many marks of favour often did me the honour of a
visit desired to be informed in the affairs of europe the laws and
customs the manners and learning of the several countries where i had
travelled  he listened to me with great attention and made very wise
observations on all i spoke  he had two flappers attending him for
state but never made use of them except at court and in visits of
ceremony and would always command them to withdraw when we were alone
together

i entreated this illustrious person to intercede in my behalf with his
majesty for leave to depart which he accordingly did as he was pleased
to tell me with regret for indeed he had made me several offers very
advantageous which however i refused with expressions of the highest
acknowledgment

on the 16th of february i took leave of his majesty and the court  the
king made me a present to the value of about two hundred pounds english
and my protector his kinsman as much more together with a letter of
recommendation to a friend of his in lagado the metropolis  the island
being then hovering over a mountain about two miles from it i was let
down from the lowest gallery in the same manner as i had been taken up

the continent as far as it is subject to the monarch of the flying
island passes under the general name of balnibarbi and the
metropolis as i said before is called lagado  i felt some little
satisfaction in finding myself on firm ground  i walked to the city
without any concern being clad like one of the natives and sufficiently
instructed to converse with them  i soon found out the persons house to
whom i was recommended presented my letter from his friend the grandee
in the island and was received with much kindness  this great lord
whose name was munodi ordered me an apartment in his own house where i
continued during my stay and was entertained in a most hospitable
manner

the next morning after my arrival he took me in his chariot to see the
town which is about half the bigness of london but the houses very
strangely built and most of them out of repair  the people in the
streets walked fast looked wild their eyes fixed and were generally in
rags  we passed through one of the town gates and went about three
miles into the country where i saw many labourers working with several
sorts of tools in the ground but was not able to conjecture what they
were about neither did observe any expectation either of corn or grass
although the soil appeared to be excellent  i could not forbear admiring
at these odd appearances both in town and country and i made bold to
desire my conductor that he would be pleased to explain to me what
could be meant by so many busy heads hands and faces both in the
streets and the fields because i did not discover any good effects they
produced but on the contrary i never knew a soil so unhappily
cultivated houses so ill contrived and so ruinous or a people whose
countenances and habit expressed so much misery and want

this lord munodi was a person of the first rank and had been some years
governor of lagado but by a cabal of ministers was discharged for
insufficiency  however the king treated him with tenderness as a
well-meaning man but of a low contemptible understanding

when i gave that free censure of the country and its inhabitants he made
no further answer than by telling me “that i had not been long enough
among them to form a judgment and that the different nations of the
world had different customs” with other common topics to the same
purpose  but when we returned to his palace he asked me “how i liked
the building what absurdities i observed and what quarrel i had with
the dress or looks of his domestics?”  this he might safely do because
every thing about him was magnificent regular and polite  i answered
“that his excellencys prudence quality and fortune had exempted him
from those defects which folly and beggary had produced in others”  he
said “if i would go with him to his country-house about twenty miles
distant where his estate lay there would be more leisure for this kind
of conversation”  i told his excellency “that i was entirely at his
disposal” and accordingly we set out next morning

during our journey he made me observe the several methods used by farmers
in managing their lands which to me were wholly unaccountable for
except in some very few places i could not discover one ear of corn or
blade of grass  but in three hours travelling the scene was wholly
altered we came into a most beautiful country farmers houses at small
distances neatly built the fields enclosed containing vineyards
corn-grounds and meadows  neither do i remember to have seen a more
delightful prospect  his excellency observed my countenance to clear up
he told me with a sigh “that there his estate began and would continue
the same till we should come to his house that his countrymen ridiculed
and despised him for managing his affairs no better and for setting so
ill an example to the kingdom which however was followed by very few
such as were old and wilful and weak like himself”

we came at length to the house which was indeed a noble structure built
according to the best rules of ancient architecture  the fountains
gardens walks avenues and groves were all disposed with exact
judgment and taste  i gave due praises to every thing i saw whereof his
excellency took not the least notice till after supper when there being
no third companion he told me with a very melancholy air “that he
doubted he must throw down his houses in town and country to rebuild
them after the present mode destroy all his plantations and cast others
into such a form as modern usage required and give the same directions
to all his tenants unless he would submit to incur the censure of pride
singularity affectation ignorance caprice and perhaps increase his
majestys displeasure that the admiration i appeared to be under would
cease or diminish when he had informed me of some particulars which
probably i never heard of at court the people there being too much
taken up in their own speculations to have regard to what passed here
below”

the sum of his discourse was to this effect “that about forty years ago
certain persons went up to laputa either upon business or diversion
and after five months continuance came back with a very little
smattering in mathematics but full of volatile spirits acquired in that
airy region that these persons upon their return began to dislike the
management of every thing below and fell into schemes of putting all
arts sciences languages and mechanics upon a new foot  to this end
they procured a royal patent for erecting an academy of projectors in
lagado and the humour prevailed so strongly among the people that there
is not a town of any consequence in the kingdom without such an academy
in these colleges the professors contrive new rules and methods of
agriculture and building and new instruments and tools for all trades
and manufactures whereby as they undertake one man shall do the work
of ten a palace may be built in a week of materials so durable as to
last for ever without repairing  all the fruits of the earth shall come
to maturity at whatever season we think fit to choose and increase a
hundred fold more than they do at present with innumerable other happy
proposals  the only inconvenience is that none of these projects are
yet brought to perfection and in the mean time the whole country lies
miserably waste the houses in ruins and the people without food or
clothes  by all which instead of being discouraged they are fifty
times more violently bent upon prosecuting their schemes driven equally
on by hope and despair that as for himself being not of an enterprising
spirit he was content to go on in the old forms to live in the houses
his ancestors had built and act as they did in every part of life
without innovation that some few other persons of quality and gentry had
done the same but were looked on with an eye of contempt and ill-will
as enemies to art ignorant and ill common-wealths men preferring
their own ease and sloth before the general improvement of their
country”

his lordship added “that he would not by any further particulars
prevent the pleasure i should certainly take in viewing the grand
academy whither he was resolved i should go”  he only desired me to
observe a ruined building upon the side of a mountain about three miles
distant of which he gave me this account “that he had a very convenient
mill within half a mile of his house turned by a current from a large
river and sufficient for his own family as well as a great number of
his tenants that about seven years ago a club of those projectors came
to him with proposals to destroy this mill and build another on the side
of that mountain on the long ridge whereof a long canal must be cut for
a repository of water to be conveyed up by pipes and engines to supply
the mill because the wind and air upon a height agitated the water and
thereby made it fitter for motion and because the water descending down
a declivity would turn the mill with half the current of a river whose
course is more upon a level”  he said “that being then not very well
with the court and pressed by many of his friends he complied with the
proposal and after employing a hundred men for two years the work
miscarried the projectors went off laying the blame entirely upon him
railing at him ever since and putting others upon the same experiment
with equal assurance of success as well as equal disappointment”

in a few days we came back to town and his excellency considering the
bad character he had in the academy would not go with me himself but
recommended me to a friend of his to bear me company thither  my lord
was pleased to represent me as a great admirer of projects and a person
of much curiosity and easy belief which indeed was not without truth
for i had myself been a sort of projector in my younger days



chapter v


the author permitted to see the grand academy of lagado  the academy
largely described  the arts wherein the professors employ themselves

this academy is not an entire single building but a continuation of
several houses on both sides of a street which growing waste was
purchased and applied to that use

i was received very kindly by the warden and went for many days to the
academy  every room has in it one or more projectors and i believe i
could not be in fewer than five hundred rooms

the first man i saw was of a meagre aspect with sooty hands and face
his hair and beard long ragged and singed in several places  his
clothes shirt and skin were all of the same colour  he has been eight
years upon a project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers which were
to be put in phials hermetically sealed and let out to warm the air in
raw inclement summers  he told me he did not doubt that in eight
years more he should be able to supply the governors gardens with
sunshine at a reasonable rate but he complained that his stock was low
and entreated me “to give him something as an encouragement to ingenuity
especially since this had been a very dear season for cucumbers”  i made
him a small present for my lord had furnished me with money on purpose
because he knew their practice of begging from all who go to see them

i went into another chamber but was ready to hasten back being almost
overcome with a horrible stink  my conductor pressed me forward
conjuring me in a whisper “to give no offence which would be highly
resented” and therefore i durst not so much as stop my nose  the
projector of this cell was the most ancient student of the academy his
face and beard were of a pale yellow his hands and clothes daubed over
with filth  when i was presented to him he gave me a close embrace a
compliment i could well have excused  his employment from his first
coming into the academy was an operation to reduce human excrement to
its original food by separating the several parts removing the tincture
which it receives from the gall making the odour exhale and scumming
off the saliva  he had a weekly allowance from the society of a vessel
filled with human ordure about the bigness of a bristol barrel

i saw another at work to calcine ice into gunpowder who likewise showed
me a treatise he had written concerning the malleability of fire which
he intended to publish

there was a most ingenious architect who had contrived a new method for
building houses by beginning at the roof and working downward to the
foundation which he justified to me by the like practice of those two
prudent insects the bee and the spider

there was a man born blind who had several apprentices in his own
condition their employment was to mix colours for painters which their
master taught them to distinguish by feeling and smelling  it was indeed
my misfortune to find them at that time not very perfect in their
lessons and the professor himself happened to be generally mistaken
this artist is much encouraged and esteemed by the whole fraternity

in another apartment i was highly pleased with a projector who had found
a device of ploughing the ground with hogs to save the charges of
ploughs cattle and labour  the method is this in an acre of ground
you bury at six inches distance and eight deep a quantity of acorns
dates chestnuts and other mast or vegetables whereof these animals are
fondest then you drive six hundred or more of them into the field
where in a few days they will root up the whole ground in search of
their food and make it fit for sowing at the same time manuring it with
their dung it is true upon experiment they found the charge and
trouble very great and they had little or no crop  however it is not
doubted that this invention may be capable of great improvement

i went into another room where the walls and ceiling were all hung round
with cobwebs except a narrow passage for the artist to go in and out
at my entrance he called aloud to me “not to disturb his webs”  he
lamented “the fatal mistake the world had been so long in of using
silkworms while we had such plenty of domestic insects who infinitely
excelled the former because they understood how to weave as well as
spin”  and he proposed further “that by employing spiders the charge
of dyeing silks should be wholly saved” whereof i was fully convinced
when he showed me a vast number of flies most beautifully coloured
wherewith he fed his spiders assuring us “that the webs would take a
tincture from them and as he had them of all hues he hoped to fit
everybodys fancy as soon as he could find proper food for the flies of
certain gums oils and other glutinous matter to give a strength and
consistence to the threads”

there was an astronomer who had undertaken to place a sun-dial upon the
great weathercock on the town-house by adjusting the annual and diurnal
motions of the earth and sun so as to answer and coincide with all
accidental turnings of the wind

i was complaining of a small fit of the colic upon which my conductor
led me into a room where a great physician resided who was famous for
curing that disease by contrary operations from the same instrument  he
had a large pair of bellows with a long slender muzzle of ivory this he
conveyed eight inches up the anus and drawing in the wind he affirmed
he could make the guts as lank as a dried bladder  but when the disease
was more stubborn and violent he let in the muzzle while the bellows
were full of wind which he discharged into the body of the patient then
withdrew the instrument to replenish it clapping his thumb strongly
against the orifice of then fundament and this being repeated three or
four times the adventitious wind would rush out bringing the noxious
along with it (like water put into a pump) and the patient recovered
i saw him try both experiments upon a dog but could not discern any
effect from the former  after the latter the animal was ready to burst
and made so violent a discharge as was very offensive to me and my
companion  the dog died on the spot and we left the doctor endeavouring
to recover him by the same operation

i visited many other apartments but shall not trouble my reader with all
the curiosities i observed being studious of brevity

i had hitherto seen only one side of the academy the other being
appropriated to the advancers of speculative learning of whom i shall
say something when i have mentioned one illustrious person more who is
called among them “the universal artist”  he told us “he had been thirty
years employing his thoughts for the improvement of human life”  he had
two large rooms full of wonderful curiosities and fifty men at work
some were condensing air into a dry tangible substance by extracting the
nitre and letting the aqueous or fluid particles percolate others
softening marble for pillows and pin-cushions others petrifying the
hoofs of a living horse to preserve them from foundering  the artist
himself was at that time busy upon two great designs the first to sow
land with chaff wherein he affirmed the true seminal virtue to be
contained as he demonstrated by several experiments which i was not
skilful enough to comprehend  the other was by a certain composition of
gums minerals and vegetables outwardly applied to prevent the growth
of wool upon two young lambs and he hoped in a reasonable time to
propagate the breed of naked sheep all over the kingdom

we crossed a walk to the other part of the academy where as i have
already said the projectors in speculative learning resided

the first professor i saw was in a very large room with forty pupils
about him  after salutation observing me to look earnestly upon a
frame which took up the greatest part of both the length and breadth of
the room he said “perhaps i might wonder to see him employed in a
project for improving speculative knowledge by practical and mechanical
operations  but the world would soon be sensible of its usefulness and
he flattered himself that a more noble exalted thought never sprang in
any other mans head  every one knew how laborious the usual method is
of attaining to arts and sciences whereas by his contrivance the most
ignorant person at a reasonable charge and with a little bodily labour
might write books in philosophy poetry politics laws mathematics and
theology without the least assistance from genius or study”  he then
led me to the frame about the sides whereof all his pupils stood in
ranks  it was twenty feet square placed in the middle of the room  the
superfices was composed of several bits of wood about the bigness of a
die but some larger than others  they were all linked together by
slender wires  these bits of wood were covered on every square with
paper pasted on them and on these papers were written all the words of
their language in their several moods tenses and declensions but
without any order  the professor then desired me “to observe for he was
going to set his engine at work”  the pupils at his command took each
of them hold of an iron handle whereof there were forty fixed round the
edges of the frame and giving them a sudden turn the whole disposition
of the words was entirely changed  he then commanded six-and-thirty of
the lads to read the several lines softly as they appeared upon the
frame and where they found three or four words together that might make
part of a sentence they dictated to the four remaining boys who were
scribes  this work was repeated three or four times and at every turn
the engine was so contrived that the words shifted into new places as
the square bits of wood moved upside down

                           [picture the frame]

six hours a day the young students were employed in this labour and the
professor showed me several volumes in large folio already collected of
broken sentences which he intended to piece together and out of those
rich materials to give the world a complete body of all arts and
sciences which however might be still improved and much expedited if
the public would raise a fund for making and employing five hundred such
frames in lagado and oblige the managers to contribute in common their
several collections

he assured me “that this invention had employed all his thoughts from his
youth that he had emptied the whole vocabulary into his frame and made
the strictest computation of the general proportion there is in books
between the numbers of particles nouns and verbs and other parts of
speech”

i made my humblest acknowledgment to this illustrious person for his
great communicativeness and promised “if ever i had the good fortune to
return to my native country that i would do him justice as the sole
inventor of this wonderful machine” the form and contrivance of which i
desired leave to delineate on paper as in the figure here annexed  i
told him “although it were the custom of our learned in europe to steal
inventions from each other who had thereby at least this advantage that
it became a controversy which was the right owner yet i would take such
caution that he should have the honour entire without a rival”

we next went to the school of languages where three professors sat in
consultation upon improving that of their own country

the first project was to shorten discourse by cutting polysyllables
into one and leaving out verbs and participles because in reality all
things imaginable are but norms

the other project was a scheme for entirely abolishing all words
whatsoever and this was urged as a great advantage in point of health
as well as brevity  for it is plain that every word we speak is in
some degree a diminution of our lungs by corrosion and consequently
contributes to the shortening of our lives  an expedient was therefore
offered “that since words are only names for things it would be more
convenient for all men to carry about them such things as were necessary
to express a particular business they are to discourse on”  and this
invention would certainly have taken place to the great ease as well as
health of the subject if the women in conjunction with the vulgar and
illiterate had not threatened to raise a rebellion unless they might be
allowed the liberty to speak with their tongues after the manner of
their forefathers such constant irreconcilable enemies to science are
the common people  however many of the most learned and wise adhere to
the new scheme of expressing themselves by things which has only this
inconvenience attending it that if a mans business be very great and
of various kinds he must be obliged in proportion to carry a greater
bundle of things upon his back unless he can afford one or two strong
servants to attend him  i have often beheld two of those sages almost
sinking under the weight of their packs like pedlars among us who when
they met in the street would lay down their loads open their sacks and
hold conversation for an hour together then put up their implements
help each other to resume their burdens and take their leave

but for short conversations a man may carry implements in his pockets
and under his arms enough to supply him and in his house he cannot be
at a loss  therefore the room where company meet who practise this art
is full of all things ready at hand requisite to furnish matter for
this kind of artificial converse

another great advantage proposed by this invention was that it would
serve as a universal language to be understood in all civilised nations
whose goods and utensils are generally of the same kind or nearly
resembling so that their uses might easily be comprehended  and thus
ambassadors would be qualified to treat with foreign princes or
ministers of state to whose tongues they were utter strangers

i was at the mathematical school where the master taught his pupils
after a method scarce imaginable to us in europe  the proposition and
demonstration were fairly written on a thin wafer with ink composed of
a cephalic tincture  this the student was to swallow upon a fasting
stomach and for three days following eat nothing but bread and water
as the wafer digested the tincture mounted to his brain bearing the
proposition along with it  but the success has not hitherto been
answerable partly by some error in the quantum or composition and
partly by the perverseness of lads to whom this bolus is so nauseous
that they generally steal aside and discharge it upwards before it can
operate neither have they been yet persuaded to use so long an
abstinence as the prescription requires



chapter vi


a further account of the academy  the author proposes some improvements
which are honourably received

in the school of political projectors i was but ill entertained the
professors appearing in my judgment wholly out of their senses which
is a scene that never fails to make me melancholy  these unhappy people
were proposing schemes for persuading monarchs to choose favourites upon
the score of their wisdom capacity and virtue of teaching ministers to
consult the public good of rewarding merit great abilities eminent
services of instructing princes to know their true interest by placing
it on the same foundation with that of their people of choosing for
employments persons qualified to exercise them with many other wild
impossible chimeras that never entered before into the heart of man to
conceive and confirmed in me the old observation “that there is nothing
so extravagant and irrational which some philosophers have not
maintained for truth”

but however i shall so far do justice to this part of the academy as
to acknowledge that all of them were not so visionary  there was a most
ingenious doctor who seemed to be perfectly versed in the whole nature
and system of government  this illustrious person had very usefully
employed his studies in finding out effectual remedies for all diseases
and corruptions to which the several kinds of public administration are
subject by the vices or infirmities of those who govern as well as by
the licentiousness of those who are to obey  for instance whereas all
writers and reasoners have agreed that there is a strict universal
resemblance between the natural and the political body can there be any
thing more evident than that the health of both must be preserved and
the diseases cured by the same prescriptions?  it is allowed that
senates and great councils are often troubled with redundant ebullient
and other peccant humours with many diseases of the head and more of
the heart with strong convulsions with grievous contractions of the
nerves and sinews in both hands but especially the right with spleen
flatus vertigos and deliriums with scrofulous tumours full of fetid
purulent matter with sour frothy ructations with canine appetites and
crudeness of digestion besides many others needless to mention  this
doctor therefore proposed “that upon the meeting of the senate certain
physicians should attend it the three first days of their sitting and at
the close of each days debate feel the pulses of every senator after
which having maturely considered and consulted upon the nature of the
several maladies and the methods of cure they should on the fourth day
return to the senate house attended by their apothecaries stored with
proper medicines and before the members sat administer to each of them
lenitives aperitives abstersives corrosives restringents
palliatives laxatives cephalalgics icterics apophlegmatics
acoustics as their several cases required and according as these
medicines should operate repeat alter or omit them at the next
meeting”

this project could not be of any great expense to the public and might
in my poor opinion be of much use for the despatch of business in those
countries where senates have any share in the legislative power beget
unanimity shorten debates open a few mouths which are now closed and
close many more which are now open curb the petulancy of the young and
correct the positiveness of the old rouse the stupid and damp the pert

again because it is a general complaint that the favourites of princes
are troubled with short and weak memories the same doctor proposed
“that whoever attended a first minister after having told his business
with the utmost brevity and in the plainest words should at his
departure give the said minister a tweak by the nose or a kick in the
belly or tread on his corns or lug him thrice by both ears or run a
pin into his breech or pinch his arm black and blue to prevent
forgetfulness and at every levee day repeat the same operation till
the business were done or absolutely refused”

he likewise directed “that every senator in the great council of a
nation after he had delivered his opinion and argued in the defence of
it should be obliged to give his vote directly contrary because if that
were done the result would infallibly terminate in the good of the
public”

when parties in a state are violent he offered a wonderful contrivance
to reconcile them  the method is this you take a hundred leaders of
each party you dispose them into couples of such whose heads are nearest
of a size then let two nice operators saw off the occiput of each couple
at the same time in such a manner that the brain may be equally divided
let the occiputs thus cut off be interchanged applying each to the
head of his opposite party-man  it seems indeed to be a work that
requires some exactness but the professor assured us “that if it were
dexterously performed the cure would be infallible”  for he argued
thus “that the two half brains being left to debate the matter between
themselves within the space of one skull would soon come to a good
understanding and produce that moderation as well as regularity of
thinking so much to be wished for in the heads of those who imagine
they come into the world only to watch and govern its motion and as to
the difference of brains in quantity or quality among those who are
directors in faction the doctor assured us from his own knowledge that
it was a perfect trifle”

i heard a very warm debate between two professors about the most
commodious and effectual ways and means of raising money without
grieving the subject  the first affirmed “the justest method would be
to lay a certain tax upon vices and folly and the sum fixed upon every
man to be rated after the fairest manner by a jury of his neighbours”
the second was of an opinion directly contrary “to tax those qualities
of body and mind for which men chiefly value themselves the rate to be
more or less according to the degrees of excelling the decision whereof
should be left entirely to their own breast”  the highest tax was upon
men who are the greatest favourites of the other sex and the
assessments according to the number and nature of the favours they have
received for which they are allowed to be their own vouchers  wit
valour and politeness were likewise proposed to be largely taxed and
collected in the same manner by every persons giving his own word for
the quantum of what he possessed  but as to honour justice wisdom and
learning they should not be taxed at all because they are
qualifications of so singular a kind that no man will either allow them
in his neighbour or value them in himself

the women were proposed to be taxed according to their beauty and skill
in dressing wherein they had the same privilege with the men to be
determined by their own judgment  but constancy chastity good sense
and good nature were not rated because they would not bear the charge
of collecting

to keep senators in the interest of the crown it was proposed that the
members should raffle for employment every man first taking an oath and
giving security that he would vote for the court whether he won or not
after which the losers had in their turn the liberty of raffling upon
the next vacancy  thus hope and expectation would be kept alive none
would complain of broken promises but impute their disappointments
wholly to fortune whose shoulders are broader and stronger than those of
a ministry

another professor showed me a large paper of instructions for discovering
plots and conspiracies against the government  he advised great
statesmen to examine into the diet of all suspected persons their times
of eating upon which side they lay in bed with which hand they wipe
their posteriors take a strict view of their excrements and from the
colour the odour the taste the consistence the crudeness or maturity
of digestion form a judgment of their thoughts and designs because men
are never so serious thoughtful and intent as when they are at stool
which he found by frequent experiment for in such conjunctures when he
used merely as a trial to consider which was the best way of murdering
the king his ordure would have a tincture of green but quite different
when he thought only of raising an insurrection or burning the
metropolis

the whole discourse was written with great acuteness containing many
observations both curious and useful for politicians but as i
conceived not altogether complete  this i ventured to tell the author
and offered if he pleased to supply him with some additions  he
received my proposition with more compliance than is usual among writers
especially those of the projecting species professing “he would be glad
to receive further information”

i told him “that in the kingdom of tribnia {454a} by the natives called
langdon {454b} where i had sojourned some time in my travels the bulk
of the people consist in a manner wholly of discoverers witnesses
informers accusers prosecutors evidences swearers together with
their several subservient and subaltern instruments all under the
colours the conduct and the pay of ministers of state and their
deputies  the plots in that kingdom are usually the workmanship of
those persons who desire to raise their own characters of profound
politicians to restore new vigour to a crazy administration to stifle
or divert general discontents to fill their coffers with forfeitures
and raise or sink the opinion of public credit as either shall best
answer their private advantage  it is first agreed and settled among
them what suspected persons shall be accused of a plot then effectual
care is taken to secure all their letters and papers and put the owners
in chains  these papers are delivered to a set of artists very
dexterous in finding out the mysterious meanings of words syllables and
letters for instance they can discover a close stool to signify a
privy council a flock of geese a senate a lame dog an invader the
plague a standing army a buzzard a prime minister the gout a high
priest a gibbet a secretary of state a chamber pot a committee of
grandees a sieve a court lady a broom a revolution a mouse-trap an
employment a bottomless pit a treasury a sink a court a cap and
bells a favourite a broken reed a court of justice an empty tun a
general a running sore the administration {455}

“when this method fails they have two others more effectual which the
learned among them call acrostics and anagrams  first they can decipher
all initial letters into political meanings  thus n shall signify a
plot b a regiment of horse l a fleet at sea or secondly by
transposing the letters of the alphabet in any suspected paper they can
lay open the deepest designs of a discontented party  so for example
if i should say in a letter to a friend  our brother tom has just got
the piles a skilful decipherer would discover that the same letters
which compose that sentence may be analysed into the following words
 resist — a plot is brought home—the tour  and this is the
anagrammatic method”

the professor made me great acknowledgments for communicating these
observations and promised to make honourable mention of me in his
treatise

i saw nothing in this country that could invite me to a longer
continuance and began to think of returning home to england



chapter vii


the author leaves lagado arrives at maldonada  no ship ready  he takes
a short voyage to glubbdubdrib  his reception by the governor

the continent of which this kingdom is apart extends itself as i have
reason to believe eastward to that unknown tract of america westward of
california and north to the pacific ocean which is not above a hundred
and fifty miles from lagado where there is a good port and much
commerce with the great island of luggnagg situated to the north-west
about 29 degrees north latitude and 140 longitude  this island of
luggnagg stands south-eastward of japan about a hundred leagues distant
there is a strict alliance between the japanese emperor and the king of
luggnagg which affords frequent opportunities of sailing from one island
to the other  i determined therefore to direct my course this way in
order to my return to europe  i hired two mules with a guide to show
me the way and carry my small baggage  i took leave of my noble
protector who had shown me so much favour and made me a generous
present at my departure

my journey was without any accident or adventure worth relating  when i
arrived at the port of maldonada (for so it is called) there was no ship
in the harbour bound for luggnagg nor likely to be in some time  the
town is about as large as portsmouth  i soon fell into some
acquaintance and was very hospitably received  a gentleman of
distinction said to me “that since the ships bound for luggnagg could
not be ready in less than a month it might be no disagreeable amusement
for me to take a trip to the little island of glubbdubdrib about five
leagues off to the south-west”  he offered himself and a friend to
accompany me and that i should be provided with a small convenient bark
for the voyage

glubbdubdrib as nearly as i can interpret the word signifies the island
of sorcerers or magicians  it is about one third as large as the isle of
wight and extremely fruitful it is governed by the head of a certain
tribe who are all magicians  this tribe marries only among each other
and the eldest in succession is prince or governor  he has a noble
palace and a park of about three thousand acres surrounded by a wall of
hewn stone twenty feet high  in this park are several small enclosures
for cattle corn and gardening

the governor and his family are served and attended by domestics of a
kind somewhat unusual  by his skill in necromancy he has a power of
calling whom he pleases from the dead and commanding their service for
twenty-four hours but no longer nor can he call the same persons up
again in less than three months except upon very extraordinary
occasions

when we arrived at the island which was about eleven in the morning one
of the gentlemen who accompanied me went to the governor and desired
admittance for a stranger who came on purpose to have the honour of
attending on his highness  this was immediately granted and we all
three entered the gate of the palace between two rows of guards armed
and dressed after a very antic manner and with something in their
countenances that made my flesh creep with a horror i cannot express  we
passed through several apartments between servants of the same sort
ranked on each side as before till we came to the chamber of presence
where after three profound obeisances and a few general questions we
were permitted to sit on three stools near the lowest step of his
highnesss throne  he understood the language of balnibarbi although it
was different from that of this island  he desired me to give him some
account of my travels and to let me see that i should be treated
without ceremony he dismissed all his attendants with a turn of his
finger at which to my great astonishment they vanished in an instant
like visions in a dream when we awake on a sudden  i could not recover
myself in some time till the governor assured me “that i should receive
no hurt” and observing my two companions to be under no concern who had
been often entertained in the same manner i began to take courage and
related to his highness a short history of my several adventures yet not
without some hesitation and frequently looking behind me to the place
where i had seen those domestic spectres  i had the honour to dine with
the governor where a new set of ghosts served up the meat and waited at
table  i now observed myself to be less terrified than i had been in the
morning  i stayed till sunset but humbly desired his highness to excuse
me for not accepting his invitation of lodging in the palace  my two
friends and i lay at a private house in the town adjoining which is the
capital of this little island and the next morning we returned to pay
our duty to the governor as he was pleased to command us

after this manner we continued in the island for ten days most part of
every day with the governor and at night in our lodging  i soon grew so
familiarized to the sight of spirits that after the third or fourth time
they gave me no emotion at all or if i had any apprehensions left my
curiosity prevailed over them  for his highness the governor ordered me
“to call up whatever persons i would choose to name and in whatever
numbers among all the dead from the beginning of the world to the
present time and command them to answer any questions i should think fit
to ask with this condition that my questions must be confined within
the compass of the times they lived in  and one thing i might depend
upon that they would certainly tell me the truth for lying was a talent
of no use in the lower world”

i made my humble acknowledgments to his highness for so great a favour
we were in a chamber from whence there was a fair prospect into the
park  and because my first inclination was to be entertained with scenes
of pomp and magnificence i desired to see alexander the great at the
head of his army just after the battle of arbela which upon a motion
of the governors finger immediately appeared in a large field under
the window where we stood  alexander was called up into the room it was
with great difficulty that i understood his greek and had but little of
my own  he assured me upon his honour “that he was not poisoned but
died of a bad fever by excessive drinking”

next i saw hannibal passing the alps who told me “he had not a drop of
vinegar in his camp”

i saw cæsar and pompey at the head of their troops just ready to engage
i saw the former in his last great triumph  i desired that the senate
of rome might appear before me in one large chamber and an assembly of
somewhat a later age in counterview in another  the first seemed to be
an assembly of heroes and demigods the other a knot of pedlars
pick-pockets highwayman and bullies

the governor at my request gave the sign for cæsar and brutus to
advance towards us  i was struck with a profound veneration at the sight
of brutus and could easily discover the most consummate virtue the
greatest intrepidity and firmness of mind the truest love of his
country and general benevolence for mankind in every lineament of his
countenance  i observed with much pleasure that these two persons were
in good intelligence with each other and cæsar freely confessed to me
“that the greatest actions of his own life were not equal by many
degrees to the glory of taking it away”  i had the honour to have much
conversation with brutus and was told “that his ancestor junius
socrates epaminondas cato the younger sir thomas more and himself
were perpetually together” a sextumvirate to which all the ages of the
world cannot add a seventh

it would be tedious to trouble the reader with relating what vast numbers
of illustrious persons were called up to gratify that insatiable desire i
had to see the world in every period of antiquity placed before me  i
chiefly fed mine eyes with beholding the destroyers of tyrants and
usurpers and the restorers of liberty to oppressed and injured nations
but it is impossible to express the satisfaction i received in my own
mind after such a manner as to make it a suitable entertainment to the
reader



chapter viii


a further account of glubbdubdrib  ancient and modern history corrected

having a desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for wit and
learning i set apart one day on purpose  i proposed that homer and
aristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators but these
were so numerous that some hundreds were forced to attend in the court
and outward rooms of the palace  i knew and could distinguish those two
heroes at first sight not only from the crowd but from each other
homer was the taller and comelier person of the two walked very erect
for one of his age and his eyes were the most quick and piercing i ever
beheld  aristotle stooped much and made use of a staff  his visage was
meagre his hair lank and thin and his voice hollow  i soon discovered
that both of them were perfect strangers to the rest of the company and
had never seen or heard of them before and i had a whisper from a ghost
who shall be nameless “that these commentators always kept in the most
distant quarters from their principals in the lower world through a
consciousness of shame and guilt because they had so horribly
misrepresented the meaning of those authors to posterity”  i introduced
didymus and eustathius to homer and prevailed on him to treat them
better than perhaps they deserved for he soon found they wanted a genius
to enter into the spirit of a poet  but aristotle was out of all
patience with the account i gave him of scotus and ramus as i presented
them to him and he asked them “whether the rest of the tribe were as
great dunces as themselves?”

i then desired the governor to call up descartes and gassendi with whom
i prevailed to explain their systems to aristotle  this great
philosopher freely acknowledged his own mistakes in natural philosophy
because he proceeded in many things upon conjecture as all men must do
and he found that gassendi who had made the doctrine of epicurus as
palatable as he could and the vortices of descartes were equally to be
exploded  he predicted the same fate to attraction whereof the
present learned are such zealous asserters  he said “that new systems
of nature were but new fashions which would vary in every age and even
those who pretend to demonstrate them from mathematical principles
would flourish but a short period of time and be out of vogue when that
was determined”

i spent five days in conversing with many others of the ancient learned
i saw most of the first roman emperors  i prevailed on the governor to
call up heliogabaluss cooks to dress us a dinner but they could not
show us much of their skill for want of materials  a helot of agesilaus
made us a dish of spartan broth but i was not able to get down a second
spoonful

the two gentlemen who conducted me to the island were pressed by their
private affairs to return in three days which i employed in seeing some
of the modern dead who had made the greatest figure for two or three
hundred years past in our own and other countries of europe and having
been always a great admirer of old illustrious families i desired the
governor would call up a dozen or two of kings with their ancestors in
order for eight or nine generations  but my disappointment was grievous
and unexpected  for instead of a long train with royal diadems i saw
in one family two fiddlers three spruce courtiers and an italian
prelate  in another a barber an abbot and two cardinals  i have too
great a veneration for crowned heads to dwell any longer on so nice a
subject  but as to counts marquises dukes earls and the like i was
not so scrupulous  and i confess it was not without some pleasure that
i found myself able to trace the particular features by which certain
families are distinguished up to their originals  i could plainly
discover whence one family derives a long chin why a second has abounded
with knaves for two generations and fools for two more why a third
happened to be crack-brained and a fourth to be sharpers whence it
came what polydore virgil says of a certain great house nec vir
fortis nec foemina casta how cruelty falsehood and cowardice grew
to be characteristics by which certain families are distinguished as much
as by their coats of arms who first brought the pox into a noble house
which has lineally descended scrofulous tumours to their posterity
neither could i wonder at all this when i saw such an interruption of
lineages by pages lackeys valets coachmen gamesters fiddlers
players captains and pickpockets

i was chiefly disgusted with modern history  for having strictly
examined all the persons of greatest name in the courts of princes for a
hundred years past i found how the world had been misled by prostitute
writers to ascribe the greatest exploits in war to cowards the wisest
counsel to fools sincerity to flatterers roman virtue to betrayers
of their country piety to atheists chastity to sodomites truth to
informers how many innocent and excellent persons had been condemned to
death or banishment by the practising of great ministers upon the
corruption of judges and the malice of factions how many villains had
been exalted to the highest places of trust power dignity and profit
how great a share in the motions and events of courts councils and
senates might be challenged by bawds whores pimps parasites and
buffoons  how low an opinion i had of human wisdom and integrity when i
was truly informed of the springs and motives of great enterprises and
revolutions in the world and of the contemptible accidents to which they
owed their success

here i discovered the roguery and ignorance of those who pretend to write
anecdotes or secret history who send so many kings to their graves with
a cup of poison will repeat the discourse between a prince and chief
minister where no witness was by unlock the thoughts and cabinets of
ambassadors and secretaries of state and have the perpetual misfortune
to be mistaken  here i discovered the true causes of many great events
that have surprised the world how a whore can govern the back-stairs
the back-stairs a council and the council a senate  a general
confessed in my presence “that he got a victory purely by the force of
cowardice and ill conduct” and an admiral “that for want of proper
intelligence he beat the enemy to whom he intended to betray the
fleet”  three kings protested to me “that in their whole reigns they
never did once prefer any person of merit unless by mistake or
treachery of some minister in whom they confided neither would they do
it if they were to live again” and they showed with great strength of
reason “that the royal throne could not be supported without corruption
because that positive confident restiff temper which virtue infused
into a man was a perpetual clog to public business”

i had the curiosity to inquire in a particular manner by what methods
great numbers had procured to themselves high titles of honour and
prodigious estates and i confined my inquiry to a very modern period
however without grating upon present times because i would be sure to
give no offence even to foreigners (for i hope the reader need not be
told that i do not in the least intend my own country in what i say
upon this occasion) a great number of persons concerned were called up
and upon a very slight examination discovered such a scene of infamy
that i cannot reflect upon it without some seriousness  perjury
oppression subornation fraud pandarism and the like infirmities were
among the most excusable arts they had to mention and for these i gave
as it was reasonable great allowance  but when some confessed they owed
their greatness and wealth to sodomy or incest others to the
prostituting of their own wives and daughters others to the betraying
of their country or their prince some to poisoning more to the
perverting of justice in order to destroy the innocent i hope i may be
pardoned if these discoveries inclined me a little to abate of that
profound veneration which i am naturally apt to pay to persons of high
rank who ought to be treated with the utmost respect due to their
sublime dignity by us their inferiors

i had often read of some great services done to princes and states and
desired to see the persons by whom those services were performed  upon
inquiry i was told “that their names were to be found on no record
except a few of them whom history has represented as the vilest of
rogues and traitors”  as to the rest i had never once heard of them
they all appeared with dejected looks and in the meanest habit most of
them telling me “they died in poverty and disgrace and the rest on a
scaffold or a gibbet”

among others there was one person whose case appeared a little
singular  he had a youth about eighteen years old standing by his side
he told me “he had for many years been commander of a ship and in the
sea fight at actium had the good fortune to break through the enemys
great line of battle sink three of their capital ships and take a
fourth which was the sole cause of antonys flight and of the victory
that ensued that the youth standing by him his only son was killed in
the action”  he added “that upon the confidence of some merit the war
being at an end he went to rome and solicited at the court of augustus
to be preferred to a greater ship whose commander had been killed but
without any regard to his pretensions it was given to a boy who had
never seen the sea the son of libertina who waited on one of the
emperors mistresses  returning back to his own vessel he was charged
with neglect of duty and the ship given to a favourite page of
publicola the vice-admiral whereupon he retired to a poor farm at a
great distance from rome and there ended his life”  i was so curious to
know the truth of this story that i desired agrippa might be called who
was admiral in that fight  he appeared and confirmed the whole account
but with much more advantage to the captain whose modesty had extenuated
or concealed a great part of his merit

i was surprised to find corruption grown so high and so quick in that
empire by the force of luxury so lately introduced which made me less
wonder at many parallel cases in other countries where vices of all
kinds have reigned so much longer and where the whole praise as well as
pillage has been engrossed by the chief commander who perhaps had the
least title to either

as every person called up made exactly the same appearance he had done in
the world it gave me melancholy reflections to observe how much the race
of human kind was degenerated among us within these hundred years past
how the pox under all its consequences and denominations had altered
every lineament of an english countenance shortened the size of bodies
unbraced the nerves relaxed the sinews and muscles introduced a sallow
complexion and rendered the flesh loose and rancid

i descended so low as to desire some english yeoman of the old stamp
might be summoned to appear once so famous for the simplicity of their
manners diet and dress for justice in their dealings for their true
spirit of liberty for their valour and love of their country  neither
could i be wholly unmoved after comparing the living with the dead when
i considered how all these pure native virtues were prostituted for a
piece of money by their grand-children who in selling their votes and
managing at elections have acquired every vice and corruption that can
possibly be learned in a court



chapter ix


the author returns to maldonada  sails to the kingdom of luggnagg  the
author confined  he is sent for to court  the manner of his admittance
the kings great lenity to his subjects

the day of our departure being come i took leave of his highness the
governor of glubbdubdrib and returned with my two companions to
maldonada where after a fortnights waiting a ship was ready to sail
for luggnagg  the two gentlemen and some others were so generous and
kind as to furnish me with provisions and see me on board  i was a
month in this voyage  we had one violent storm and were under a
necessity of steering westward to get into the trade wind which holds
for above sixty leagues  on the 21st of april 1708 we sailed into the
river of clumegnig which is a seaport town at the south-east point of
luggnagg  we cast anchor within a league of the town and made a signal
for a pilot  two of them came on board in less than half an hour by
whom we were guided between certain shoals and rocks which are very
dangerous in the passage to a large basin where a fleet may ride in
safety within a cables length of the town-wall

some of our sailors whether out of treachery or inadvertence had
informed the pilots “that i was a stranger and great traveller” whereof
these gave notice to a custom-house officer by whom i was examined very
strictly upon my landing  this officer spoke to me in the language of
balnibarbi which by the force of much commerce is generally understood
in that town especially by seamen and those employed in the customs  i
gave him a short account of some particulars and made my story as
plausible and consistent as i could but i thought it necessary to
disguise my country and call myself a hollander because my intentions
were for japan and i knew the dutch were the only europeans permitted to
enter into that kingdom  i therefore told the officer “that having been
shipwrecked on the coast of balnibarbi and cast on a rock i was
received up into laputa or the flying island (of which he had often
heard) and was now endeavouring to get to japan whence i might find a
convenience of returning to my own country”  the officer said “i must
be confined till he could receive orders from court for which he would
write immediately and hoped to receive an answer in a fortnight”  i was
carried to a convenient lodging with a sentry placed at the door
however i had the liberty of a large garden and was treated with
humanity enough being maintained all the time at the kings charge  i
was invited by several persons chiefly out of curiosity because it was
reported that i came from countries very remote of which they had never
heard

i hired a young man who came in the same ship to be an interpreter he
was a native of luggnagg but had lived some years at maldonada and was
a perfect master of both languages  by his assistance i was able to
hold a conversation with those who came to visit me but this consisted
only of their questions and my answers

the despatch came from court about the time we expected  it contained a
warrant for conducting me and my retinue to traldragdubh or
trildrogdrib (for it is pronounced both ways as near as i can
remember) by a party of ten horse  all my retinue was that poor lad for
an interpreter whom i persuaded into my service and at my humble
request we had each of us a mule to ride on  a messenger was despatched
half a days journey before us to give the king notice of my approach
and to desire “that his majesty would please to appoint a day and hour
when it would by his gracious pleasure that i might have the honour to
lick the dust before his footstool”  this is the court style and i
found it to be more than matter of form for upon my admittance two days
after my arrival i was commanded to crawl upon my belly and lick the
floor as i advanced but on account of my being a stranger care was
taken to have it made so clean that the dust was not offensive
however this was a peculiar grace not allowed to any but persons of the
highest rank when they desire an admittance  nay sometimes the floor
is strewed with dust on purpose when the person to be admitted happens
to have powerful enemies at court and i have seen a great lord with his
mouth so crammed that when he had crept to the proper distance from the
throne he was not able to speak a word  neither is there any remedy
because it is capital for those who receive an audience to spit or wipe
their mouths in his majestys presence  there is indeed another custom
which i cannot altogether approve of when the king has a mind to put any
of his nobles to death in a gentle indulgent manner he commands the
floor to be strewed with a certain brown powder of a deadly composition
which being licked up infallibly kills him in twenty-four hours  but in
justice to this princes great clemency and the care he has of his
subjects lives (wherein it were much to be wished that the monarchs of
europe would imitate him) it must be mentioned for his honour that
strict orders are given to have the infected parts of the floor well
washed after every such execution which if his domestics neglect they
are in danger of incurring his royal displeasure  i myself heard him
give directions that one of his pages should be whipped whose turn it
was to give notice about washing the floor after an execution but
maliciously had omitted it by which neglect a young lord of great hopes
coming to an audience was unfortunately poisoned although the king at
that time had no design against his life  but this good prince was so
gracious as to forgive the poor page his whipping upon promise that he
would do so no more without special orders

to return from this digression  when i had crept within four yards of
the throne i raised myself gently upon my knees and then striking my
forehead seven times against the ground i pronounced the following
words as they had been taught me the night before inckpling
gloffthrobb squut serummblhiop mlashnalt zwin tnodbalkuffh slhiophad
gurdlubh asht  this is the compliment established by the laws of the
land for all persons admitted to the kings presence  it may be
rendered into english thus “may your celestial majesty outlive the sun
eleven moons and a half”  to this the king returned some answer which
although i could not understand yet i replied as i had been directed
fluft drin yalerick dwuldom prastrad mirpush which properly signifies
“my tongue is in the mouth of my friend” and by this expression was
meant that i desired leave to bring my interpreter whereupon the young
man already mentioned was accordingly introduced by whose intervention i
answered as many questions as his majesty could put in above an hour  i
spoke in the balnibarbian tongue and my interpreter delivered my meaning
in that of luggnagg

the king was much delighted with my company and ordered his
bliffmarklub or high-chamberlain to appoint a lodging in the court
for me and my interpreter with a daily allowance for my table and a
large purse of gold for my common expenses

i staid three months in this country out of perfect obedience to his
majesty who was pleased highly to favour me and made me very honourable
offers  but i thought it more consistent with prudence and justice to
pass the remainder of my days with my wife and family



chapter x


the luggnaggians commended  a particular description of the struldbrugs
with many conversations between the author and some eminent persons upon
that subject

the luggnaggians are a polite and generous people and although they are
not without some share of that pride which is peculiar to all eastern
countries yet they show themselves courteous to strangers especially
such who are countenanced by the court  i had many acquaintance and
among persons of the best fashion and being always attended by my
interpreter the conversation we had was not disagreeable

one day in much good company i was asked by a person of quality
“whether i had seen any of their struldbrugs or immortals?”  i said
“i had not” and desired he would explain to me “what he meant by such an
appellation applied to a mortal creature”  he told me “that sometimes
though very rarely a child happened to be born in a family with a red
circular spot in the forehead directly over the left eyebrow which was
an infallible mark that it should never die”  the spot as he described
it “was about the compass of a silver threepence but in the course of
time grew larger and changed its colour for at twelve years old it
became green so continued till five and twenty then turned to a deep
blue at five and forty it grew coal black and as large as an english
shilling but never admitted any further alteration”  he said “these
births were so rare that he did not believe there could be above eleven
hundred struldbrugs of both sexes in the whole kingdom of which he
computed about fifty in the metropolis and among the rest a young girl
born about three years ago that these productions were not peculiar to
any family but a mere effect of chance and the children of the
struldbrugs themselves were equally mortal with the rest of the
people”

i freely own myself to have been struck with inexpressible delight upon
hearing this account and the person who gave it me happening to
understand the balnibarbian language which i spoke very well i could
not forbear breaking out into expressions perhaps a little too
extravagant  i cried out as in a rapture “happy nation where every
child hath at least a chance for being immortal  happy people who enjoy
so many living examples of ancient virtue and have masters ready to
instruct them in the wisdom of all former ages but happiest beyond all
comparison are those excellent struldbrugs who being born exempt
from that universal calamity of human nature have their minds free and
disengaged without the weight and depression of spirits caused by the
continual apprehensions of death”  i discovered my admiration “that i
had not observed any of these illustrious persons at court the black
spot on the forehead being so remarkable a distinction that i could not
have easily overlooked it and it was impossible that his majesty a most
judicious prince should not provide himself with a good number of such
wise and able counsellors  yet perhaps the virtue of those reverend
sages was too strict for the corrupt and libertine manners of a court
and we often find by experience that young men are too opinionated and
volatile to be guided by the sober dictates of their seniors  however
since the king was pleased to allow me access to his royal person i was
resolved upon the very first occasion to deliver my opinion to him on
this matter freely and at large by the help of my interpreter and
whether he would please to take my advice or not yet in one thing i was
determined that his majesty having frequently offered me an
establishment in this country i would with great thankfulness accept
the favour and pass my life here in the conversation of those superior
beings the struldbrugs if they would please to admit me”

the gentleman to whom i addressed my discourse because (as i have
already observed) he spoke the language of balnibarbi said to me with a
sort of a smile which usually arises from pity to the ignorant “that he
was glad of any occasion to keep me among them and desired my permission
to explain to the company what i had spoke”  he did so and they talked
together for some time in their own language whereof i understood not a
syllable neither could i observe by their countenances what impression
my discourse had made on them  after a short silence the same person
told me “that his friends and mine (so he thought fit to express
himself) were very much pleased with the judicious remarks i had made on
the great happiness and advantages of immortal life and they were
desirous to know in a particular manner what scheme of living i should
have formed to myself if it had fallen to my lot to have been born a
struldbrug”

i answered “it was easy to be eloquent on so copious and delightful a
subject especially to me who had been often apt to amuse myself with
visions of what i should do if i were a king a general or a great
lord and upon this very case i had frequently run over the whole system
how i should employ myself and pass the time if i were sure to live for
ever

“that if it had been my good fortune to come into the world a
struldbrug as soon as i could discover my own happiness by
understanding the difference between life and death i would first
resolve by all arts and methods whatsoever to procure myself riches
in the pursuit of which by thrift and management i might reasonably
expect in about two hundred years to be the wealthiest man in the
kingdom  in the second place i would from my earliest youth apply
myself to the study of arts and sciences by which i should arrive in
time to excel all others in learning  lastly i would carefully record
every action and event of consequence that happened in the public
impartially draw the characters of the several successions of princes and
great ministers of state with my own observations on every point  i
would exactly set down the several changes in customs language fashions
of dress diet and diversions  by all which acquirements i should be a
living treasure of knowledge and wisdom and certainly become the oracle
of the nation

“i would never marry after threescore but live in a hospitable manner
yet still on the saving side  i would entertain myself in forming and
directing the minds of hopeful young men by convincing them from my own
remembrance experience and observation fortified by numerous examples
of the usefulness of virtue in public and private life  but my choice
and constant companions should be a set of my own immortal brotherhood
among whom i would elect a dozen from the most ancient down to my own
contemporaries  where any of these wanted fortunes i would provide them
with convenient lodges round my own estate and have some of them always
at my table only mingling a few of the most valuable among you mortals
whom length of time would harden me to lose with little or no reluctance
and treat your posterity after the same manner just as a man diverts
himself with the annual succession of pinks and tulips in his garden
without regretting the loss of those which withered the preceding year

“these struldbrugs and i would mutually communicate our observations
and memorials through the course of time remark the several gradations
by which corruption steals into the world and oppose it in every step
by giving perpetual warning and instruction to mankind which added to
the strong influence of our own example would probably prevent that
continual degeneracy of human nature so justly complained of in all ages

“add to this the pleasure of seeing the various revolutions of states
and empires the changes in the lower and upper world ancient cities in
ruins and obscure villages become the seats of kings famous rivers
lessening into shallow brooks the ocean leaving one coast dry and
overwhelming another the discovery of many countries yet unknown
barbarity overrunning the politest nations and the most barbarous become
civilized  i should then see the discovery of the longitude the
perpetual motion the universal medicine and many other great
inventions brought to the utmost perfection

“what wonderful discoveries should we make in astronomy by outliving and
confirming our own predictions by observing the progress and return of
comets with the changes of motion in the sun moon and stars”

i enlarged upon many other topics which the natural desire of endless
life and sublunary happiness could easily furnish me with  when i had
ended and the sum of my discourse had been interpreted as before to
the rest of the company there was a good deal of talk among them in the
language of the country not without some laughter at my expense  at
last the same gentleman who had been my interpreter said “he was
desired by the rest to set me right in a few mistakes which i had fallen
into through the common imbecility of human nature and upon that
allowance was less answerable for them  that this breed of struldbrugs
was peculiar to their country for there were no such people either in
balnibarbi or japan where he had the honour to be ambassador from his
majesty and found the natives in both those kingdoms very hard to
believe that the fact was possible and it appeared from my astonishment
when he first mentioned the matter to me that i received it as a thing
wholly new and scarcely to be credited  that in the two kingdoms above
mentioned where during his residence he had conversed very much he
observed long life to be the universal desire and wish of mankind  that
whoever had one foot in the grave was sure to hold back the other as
strongly as he could  that the oldest had still hopes of living one day
longer and looked on death as the greatest evil from which nature
always prompted him to retreat  only in this island of luggnagg the
appetite for living was not so eager from the continual example of the
struldbrugs before their eyes

“that the system of living contrived by me was unreasonable and unjust
because it supposed a perpetuity of youth health and vigour which no
man could be so foolish to hope however extravagant he may be in his
wishes  that the question therefore was not whether a man would choose
to be always in the prime of youth attended with prosperity and health
but how he would pass a perpetual life under all the usual disadvantages
which old age brings along with it  for although few men will avow their
desires of being immortal upon such hard conditions yet in the two
kingdoms before mentioned of balnibarbi and japan he observed that
every man desired to put off death some time longer let it approach ever
so late and he rarely heard of any man who died willingly except he
were incited by the extremity of grief or torture  and he appealed to
me whether in those countries i had travelled as well as my own i had
not observed the same general disposition”

after this preface he gave me a particular account of the struldbrugs
among them  he said “they commonly acted like mortals till about thirty
years old after which by degrees they grew melancholy and dejected
increasing in both till they came to fourscore  this he learned from
their own confession for otherwise there not being above two or three
of that species born in an age they were too few to form a general
observation by  when they came to fourscore years which is reckoned the
extremity of living in this country they had not only all the follies
and infirmities of other old men but many more which arose from the
dreadful prospect of never dying  they were not only opinionative
peevish covetous morose vain talkative but incapable of friendship
and dead to all natural affection which never descended below their
grandchildren  envy and impotent desires are their prevailing passions
but those objects against which their envy seems principally directed
are the vices of the younger sort and the deaths of the old  by
reflecting on the former they find themselves cut off from all
possibility of pleasure and whenever they see a funeral they lament and
repine that others have gone to a harbour of rest to which they
themselves never can hope to arrive  they have no remembrance of
anything but what they learned and observed in their youth and
middle-age and even that is very imperfect and for the truth or
particulars of any fact it is safer to depend on common tradition than
upon their best recollections  the least miserable among them appear to
be those who turn to dotage and entirely lose their memories these meet
with more pity and assistance because they want many bad qualities which
abound in others

“if a struldbrug happen to marry one of his own kind the marriage is
dissolved of course by the courtesy of the kingdom as soon as the
younger of the two comes to be fourscore for the law thinks it a
reasonable indulgence that those who are condemned without any fault of
their own to a perpetual continuance in the world should not have their
misery doubled by the load of a wife

“as soon as they have completed the term of eighty years they are looked
on as dead in law their heirs immediately succeed to their estates only
a small pittance is reserved for their support and the poor ones are
maintained at the public charge  after that period they are held
incapable of any employment of trust or profit they cannot purchase
lands or take leases neither are they allowed to be witnesses in any
cause either civil or criminal not even for the decision of meers and
bounds

“at ninety they lose their teeth and hair they have at that age no
distinction of taste but eat and drink whatever they can get without
relish or appetite  the diseases they were subject to still continue
without increasing or diminishing  in talking they forget the common
appellation of things and the names of persons even of those who are
their nearest friends and relations  for the same reason they never can
amuse themselves with reading because their memory will not serve to
carry them from the beginning of a sentence to the end and by this
defect they are deprived of the only entertainment whereof they might
otherwise be capable

“the language of this country being always upon the flux the
struldbrugs of one age do not understand those of another neither are
they able after two hundred years to hold any conversation (farther
than by a few general words) with their neighbours the mortals and thus
they lie under the disadvantage of living like foreigners in their own
country”

this was the account given me of the struldbrugs as near as i can
remember  i afterwards saw five or six of different ages the youngest
not above two hundred years old who were brought to me at several times
by some of my friends but although they were told “that i was a great
traveller and had seen all the world” they had not the least curiosity
to ask me a question only desired “i would give them slumskudask” or
a token of remembrance which is a modest way of begging to avoid the
law that strictly forbids it because they are provided for by the
public although indeed with a very scanty allowance

they are despised and hated by all sorts of people  when one of them is
born it is reckoned ominous and their birth is recorded very
particularly so that you may know their age by consulting the register
which however has not been kept above a thousand years past or at
least has been destroyed by time or public disturbances  but the usual
way of computing how old they are is by asking them what kings or great
persons they can remember and then consulting history for infallibly
the last prince in their mind did not begin his reign after they were
fourscore years old

they were the most mortifying sight i ever beheld and the women more
horrible than the men  besides the usual deformities in extreme old age
they acquired an additional ghastliness in proportion to their number of
years which is not to be described and among half a dozen i soon
distinguished which was the eldest although there was not above a
century or two between them

the reader will easily believe that from what i had hear and seen my
keen appetite for perpetuity of life was much abated  i grew heartily
ashamed of the pleasing visions i had formed and thought no tyrant could
invent a death into which i would not run with pleasure from such a
life  the king heard of all that had passed between me and my friends
upon this occasion and rallied me very pleasantly wishing i could send
a couple of struldbrugs to my own country to arm our people against
the fear of death but this it seems is forbidden by the fundamental
laws of the kingdom or else i should have been well content with the
trouble and expense of transporting them

i could not but agree that the laws of this kingdom relative to the
struldbrugs were founded upon the strongest reasons and such as any
other country would be under the necessity of enacting in the like
circumstances  otherwise as avarice is the necessary consequence of old
age those immortals would in time become proprietors of the whole
nation and engross the civil power which for want of abilities to
manage must end in the ruin of the public



chapter xi


the author leaves luggnagg and sails to japan  from thence he returns
in a dutch ship to amsterdam and from amsterdam to england

i thought this account of the struldbrugs might be some entertainment
to the reader because it seems to be a little out of the common way at
least i do not remember to have met the like in any book of travels that
has come to my hands and if i am deceived my excuse must be that it is
necessary for travellers who describe the same country very often to
agree in dwelling on the same particulars without deserving the censure
of having borrowed or transcribed from those who wrote before them

there is indeed a perpetual commerce between this kingdom and the great
empire of japan and it is very probable that the japanese authors may
have given some account of the struldbrugs but my stay in japan was so
short and i was so entirely a stranger to the language that i was not
qualified to make any inquiries  but i hope the dutch upon this notice
will be curious and able enough to supply my defects

his majesty having often pressed me to accept some employment in his
court and finding me absolutely determined to return to my native
country was pleased to give me his license to depart and honoured me
with a letter of recommendation under his own hand to the emperor of
japan  he likewise presented me with four hundred and forty-four large
pieces of gold (this nation delighting in even numbers) and a red
diamond which i sold in england for eleven hundred pounds

on the 6th of may 1709 i took a solemn leave of his majesty and all my
friends  this prince was so gracious as to order a guard to conduct me
to glanguenstald which is a royal port to the south-west part of the
island  in six days i found a vessel ready to carry me to japan and
spent fifteen days in the voyage  we landed at a small port-town called
xamoschi situated on the south-east part of japan the town lies on the
western point where there is a narrow strait leading northward into
along arm of the sea upon the north-west part of which yedo the
metropolis stands  at landing i showed the custom-house officers my
letter from the king of luggnagg to his imperial majesty  they knew the
seal perfectly well it was as broad as the palm of my hand  the
impression was a king lifting up a lame beggar from the earth  the
magistrates of the town hearing of my letter received me as a public
minister  they provided me with carriages and servants and bore my
charges to yedo where i was admitted to an audience and delivered my
letter which was opened with great ceremony and explained to the
emperor by an interpreter who then gave me notice by his majestys
order “that i should signify my request and whatever it were it
should be granted for the sake of his royal brother of luggnagg”  this
interpreter was a person employed to transact affairs with the
hollanders  he soon conjectured by my countenance that i was a
european and therefore repeated his majestys commands in low dutch
which he spoke perfectly well  i answered as i had before determined
“that i was a dutch merchant shipwrecked in a very remote country
whence i had travelled by sea and land to luggnagg and then took
shipping for japan where i knew my countrymen often traded and with
some of these i hoped to get an opportunity of returning into europe i
therefore most humbly entreated his royal favour to give order that i
should be conducted in safety to nangasac”  to this i added another
petition “that for the sake of my patron the king of luggnagg his
majesty would condescend to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed on
my countrymen of trampling upon the crucifix because i had been thrown
into his kingdom by my misfortunes without any intention of trading”
when this latter petition was interpreted to the emperor he seemed a
little surprised and said “he believed i was the first of my countrymen
who ever made any scruple in this point and that he began to doubt
whether i was a real hollander or not but rather suspected i must be a
christian  however for the reasons i had offered but chiefly to
gratify the king of luggnagg by an uncommon mark of his favour he would
comply with the singularity of my humour but the affair must be managed
with dexterity and his officers should be commanded to let me pass as
it were by forgetfulness  for he assured me that if the secret should
be discovered by my countrymen the dutch they would cut my throat in the
voyage”  i returned my thanks by the interpreter for so unusual a
favour and some troops being at that time on their march to nangasac
the commanding officer had orders to convey me safe thither with
particular instructions about the business of the crucifix

on the 9th day of june 1709 i arrived at nangasac after a very long
and troublesome journey  i soon fell into the company of some dutch
sailors belonging to the amboyna of amsterdam a stout ship of 450 tons
i had lived long in holland pursuing my studies at leyden and i spoke
dutch well  the seamen soon knew whence i came last they were curious
to inquire into my voyages and course of life  i made up a story as
short and probable as i could but concealed the greatest part  i knew
many persons in holland  i was able to invent names for my parents whom
i pretended to be obscure people in the province of gelderland  i would
have given the captain (one theodorus vangrult) what he pleased to ask
for my voyage to holland but understanding i was a surgeon he was
contented to take half the usual rate on condition that i would serve
him in the way of my calling  before we took shipping i was often asked
by some of the crew whether i had performed the ceremony above
mentioned?  i evaded the question by general answers “that i had
satisfied the emperor and court in all particulars”  however a
malicious rogue of a skipper went to an officer and pointing to me told
him “i had not yet trampled on the crucifix” but the other who had
received instructions to let me pass gave the rascal twenty strokes on
the shoulders with a bamboo after which i was no more troubled with such
questions

nothing happened worth mentioning in this voyage  we sailed with a fair
wind to the cape of good hope where we staid only to take in fresh
water  on the 10th of april 1710 we arrived safe at amsterdam having
lost only three men by sickness in the voyage and a fourth who fell
from the foremast into the sea not far from the coast of guinea  from
amsterdam i soon after set sail for england in a small vessel belonging
to that city

on the 16th of april we put in at the downs  i landed next morning and
saw once more my native country after an absence of five years and six
months complete  i went straight to redriff where i arrived the same
day at two in the afternoon and found my wife and family in good health




part iv  a voyage to the country of the houyhnhnms


chapter i


the author sets out as captain of a ship  his men conspire against him
confine him a long time to his cabin and set him on shore in an unknown
land  he travels up into the country  the yahoos a strange sort of
animal described  the author meets two houyhnhnms

i continued at home with my wife and children about five months in a
very happy condition if i could have learned the lesson of knowing when
i was well  i left my poor wife big with child and accepted an
advantageous offer made me to be captain of the adventurer a stout
merchantman of 350 tons for i understood navigation well and being
grown weary of a surgeons employment at sea which however i could
exercise upon occasion i took a skilful young man of that calling one
robert purefoy into my ship  we set sail from portsmouth upon the 7th
day of september 1710 on the 14th we met with captain pocock of
bristol at teneriffe who was going to the bay of campechy to cut
logwood  on the 16th he was parted from us by a storm i heard since my
return that his ship foundered and none escaped but one cabin boy  he
was an honest man and a good sailor but a little too positive in his
own opinions which was the cause of his destruction as it has been with
several others for if he had followed my advice he might have been safe
at home with his family at this time as well as myself

i had several men who died in my ship of calentures so that i was forced
to get recruits out of barbadoes and the leeward islands where i
touched by the direction of the merchants who employed me which i had
soon too much cause to repent for i found afterwards that most of them
had been buccaneers  i had fifty hands onboard and my orders were that
i should trade with the indians in the south-sea and make what
discoveries i could  these rogues whom i had picked up debauched my
other men and they all formed a conspiracy to seize the ship and secure
me which they did one morning rushing into my cabin and binding me
hand and foot threatening to throw me overboard if i offered to stir
i told them “i was their prisoner and would submit”  this they made me
swear to do and then they unbound me only fastening one of my legs with
a chain near my bed and placed a sentry at my door with his piece
charged who was commanded to shoot me dead if i attempted my liberty
they sent me own victuals and drink and took the government of the ship
to themselves  their design was to turn pirates and plunder the
spaniards which they could not do till they got more men  but first
they resolved to sell the goods in the ship and then go to madagascar
for recruits several among them having died since my confinement  they
sailed many weeks and traded with the indians but i knew not what
course they took being kept a close prisoner in my cabin and expecting
nothing less than to be murdered as they often threatened me

upon the 9th day of may 1711 one james welch came down to my cabin and
said “he had orders from the captain to set me ashore”  i expostulated
with him but in vain neither would he so much as tell me who their new
captain was  they forced me into the long-boat letting me put on my
best suit of clothes which were as good as new and take a small bundle
of linen but no arms except my hanger and they were so civil as not to
search my pockets into which i conveyed what money i had with some
other little necessaries  they rowed about a league and then set me
down on a strand  i desired them to tell me what country it was  they
all swore “they knew no more than myself” but said “that the captain”
(as they called him) “was resolved after they had sold the lading to
get rid of me in the first place where they could discover land”  they
pushed off immediately advising me to make haste for fear of being
overtaken by the tide and so bade me farewell

in this desolate condition i advanced forward and soon got upon firm
ground where i sat down on a bank to rest myself and consider what i
had best do  when i was a little refreshed i went up into the country
resolving to deliver myself to the first savages i should meet and
purchase my life from them by some bracelets glass rings and other
toys which sailors usually provide themselves with in those voyages and
whereof i had some about me  the land was divided by long rows of trees
not regularly planted but naturally growing there was great plenty of
grass and several fields of oats  i walked very circumspectly for fear
of being surprised or suddenly shot with an arrow from behind or on
either side  i fell into a beaten road where i saw many tracts of human
feet and some of cows but most of horses  at last i beheld several
animals in a field and one or two of the same kind sitting in trees
their shape was very singular and deformed which a little discomposed
me so that i lay down behind a thicket to observe them better  some of
them coming forward near the place where i lay gave me an opportunity of
distinctly marking their form  their heads and breasts were covered with
a thick hair some frizzled and others lank they had beards like goats
and a long ridge of hair down their backs and the fore parts of their
legs and feet but the rest of their bodies was bare so that i might see
their skins which were of a brown buff colour  they had no tails nor
any hair at all on their buttocks except about the anus which i
presume nature had placed there to defend them as they sat on the
ground for this posture they used as well as lying down and often
stood on their hind feet  they climbed high trees as nimbly as a
squirrel for they had strong extended claws before and behind
terminating in sharp points and hooked  they would often spring and
bound and leap with prodigious agility  the females were not so large
as the males they had long lank hair on their heads but none on their
faces nor any thing more than a sort of down on the rest of their
bodies except about the anus and pudenda  the dugs hung between their
fore feet and often reached almost to the ground as they walked  the
hair of both sexes was of several colours brown red black and yellow
upon the whole i never beheld in all my travels so disagreeable an
animal or one against which i naturally conceived so strong an
antipathy  so that thinking i had seen enough full of contempt and
aversion i got up and pursued the beaten road hoping it might direct
me to the cabin of some indian  i had not got far when i met one of
these creatures full in my way and coming up directly to me  the ugly
monster when he saw me distorted several ways every feature of his
visage and stared as at an object he had never seen before then
approaching nearer lifted up his fore-paw whether out of curiosity or
mischief i could not tell but i drew my hanger and gave him a good blow
with the flat side of it for i durst not strike with the edge fearing
the inhabitants might be provoked against me if they should come to know
that i had killed or maimed any of their cattle  when the beast felt the
smart he drew back and roared so loud that a herd of at least forty
came flocking about me from the next field howling and making odious
faces but i ran to the body of a tree and leaning my back against it
kept them off by waving my hanger  several of this cursed brood getting
hold of the branches behind leaped up into the tree whence they began
to discharge their excrements on my head however i escaped pretty well
by sticking close to the stem of the tree but was almost stifled with
the filth which fell about me on every side

in the midst of this distress i observed them all to run away on a
sudden as fast as they could at which i ventured to leave the tree and
pursue the road wondering what it was that could put them into this
fright  but looking on my left hand i saw a horse walking softly in the
field which my persecutors having sooner discovered was the cause of
their flight  the horse started a little when he came near me but soon
recovering himself looked full in my face with manifest tokens of
wonder he viewed my hands and feet walking round me several times  i
would have pursued my journey but he placed himself directly in the way
yet looking with a very mild aspect never offering the least violence
we stood gazing at each other for some time at last i took the boldness
to reach my hand towards his neck with a design to stroke it using the
common style and whistle of jockeys when they are going to handle a
strange horse  but this animal seemed to receive my civilities with
disdain shook his head and bent his brows softly raising up his right
fore-foot to remove my hand  then he neighed three or four times but in
so different a cadence that i almost began to think he was speaking to
himself in some language of his own

while he and i were thus employed another horse came up who applying
himself to the first in a very formal manner they gently struck each
others right hoof before neighing several times by turns and varying
the sound which seemed to be almost articulate  they went some paces
off as if it were to confer together walking side by side backward and
forward like persons deliberating upon some affair of weight but often
turning their eyes towards me as it were to watch that i might not
escape  i was amazed to see such actions and behaviour in brute beasts
and concluded with myself that if the inhabitants of this country were
endued with a proportionable degree of reason they must needs be the
wisest people upon earth  this thought gave me so much comfort that i
resolved to go forward until i could discover some house or village or
meet with any of the natives leaving the two horses to discourse
together as they pleased  but the first who was a dapple gray
observing me to steal off neighed after me in so expressive a tone that
i fancied myself to understand what he meant whereupon i turned back
and came near to him to expect his farther commands but concealing my
fear as much as i could for i began to be in some pain how this
adventure might terminate and the reader will easily believe i did not
much like my present situation

the two horses came up close to me looking with great earnestness upon
my face and hands  the gray steed rubbed my hat all round with his right
fore-hoof and discomposed it so much that i was forced to adjust it
better by taking it off and settling it again whereat both he and his
companion (who was a brown bay) appeared to be much surprised the latter
felt the lappet of my coat and finding it to hang loose about me they
both looked with new signs of wonder  he stroked my right hand seeming
to admire the softness and colour but he squeezed it so hard between his
hoof and his pastern that i was forced to roar after which they both
touched me with all possible tenderness  they were under great
perplexity about my shoes and stockings which they felt very often
neighing to each other and using various gestures not unlike those of a
philosopher when he would attempt to solve some new and difficult
phenomenon

upon the whole the behaviour of these animals was so orderly and
rational so acute and judicious that i at last concluded they must
needs be magicians who had thus metamorphosed themselves upon some
design and seeing a stranger in the way resolved to divert themselves
with him or perhaps were really amazed at the sight of a man so very
different in habit feature and complexion from those who might
probably live in so remote a climate  upon the strength of this
reasoning i ventured to address them in the following manner
“gentlemen if you be conjurers as i have good cause to believe you can
understand my language therefore i make bold to let your worships know
that i am a poor distressed englishman driven by his misfortunes upon
your coast and i entreat one of you to let me ride upon his back as if
he were a real horse to some house or village where i can be relieved
in return of which favour i will make you a present of this knife and
bracelet” taking them out of my pocket  the two creatures stood silent
while i spoke seeming to listen with great attention and when i had
ended they neighed frequently towards each other as if they were
engaged in serious conversation  i plainly observed that their language
expressed the passions very well and the words might with little pains
be resolved into an alphabet more easily than the chinese

i could frequently distinguish the word yahoo which was repeated by
each of them several times and although it was impossible for me to
conjecture what it meant yet while the two horses were busy in
conversation i endeavoured to practise this word upon my tongue and as
soon as they were silent i boldly pronounced yahoo in a loud voice
imitating at the same time as near as i could the neighing of a horse
at which they were both visibly surprised and the gray repeated the same
word twice as if he meant to teach me the right accent wherein i spoke
after him as well as i could and found myself perceivably to improve
every time though very far from any degree of perfection  then the bay
tried me with a second word much harder to be pronounced but reducing
it to the english orthography may be spelt thus houyhnhnm  i did not
succeed in this so well as in the former but after two or three farther
trials i had better fortune and they both appeared amazed at my
capacity

after some further discourse which i then conjectured might relate to
me the two friends took their leaves with the same compliment of
striking each others hoof and the gray made me signs that i should walk
before him wherein i thought it prudent to comply till i could find a
better director  when i offered to slacken my pace he would cry hhuun
hhuun i guessed his meaning and gave him to understand as well as i
could “that i was weary and not able to walk faster” upon which he
would stand awhile to let me rest



chapter ii


the author conducted by a houyhnhnm to his house  the house described
the authors reception  the food of the houyhnhnms  the author in
distress for want of meat  is at last relieved  his manner of feeding
in this country

having travelled about three miles we came to a long kind of building
made of timber stuck in the ground and wattled across the roof was low
and covered with straw  i now began to be a little comforted and took
out some toys which travellers usually carry for presents to the savage
indians of america and other parts in hopes the people of the house
would be thereby encouraged to receive me kindly  the horse made me a
sign to go in first it was a large room with a smooth clay floor and a
rack and manger extending the whole length on one side  there were
three nags and two mares not eating but some of them sitting down upon
their hams which i very much wondered at but wondered more to see the
rest employed in domestic business these seemed but ordinary cattle
however this confirmed my first opinion that a people who could so far
civilise brute animals must needs excel in wisdom all the nations of the
world  the gray came in just after and thereby prevented any ill
treatment which the others might have given me  he neighed to them
several times in a style of authority and received answers

beyond this room there were three others reaching the length of the
house to which you passed through three doors opposite to each other
in the manner of a vista  we went through the second room towards the
third  here the gray walked in first beckoning me to attend i waited
in the second room and got ready my presents for the master and mistress
of the house they were two knives three bracelets of false pearls a
small looking-glass and a bead necklace  the horse neighed three or
four times and i waited to hear some answers in a human voice but i
heard no other returns than in the same dialect only one or two a little
shriller than his  i began to think that this house must belong to some
person of great note among them because there appeared so much ceremony
before i could gain admittance  but that a man of quality should be
served all by horses was beyond my comprehension  i feared my brain was
disturbed by my sufferings and misfortunes  i roused myself and looked
about me in the room where i was left alone this was furnished like the
first only after a more elegant manner  i rubbed my eyes often but the
same objects still occurred  i pinched my arms and sides to awake
myself hoping i might be in a dream  i then absolutely concluded that
all these appearances could be nothing else but necromancy and magic
but i had no time to pursue these reflections for the gray horse came to
the door and made me a sign to follow him into the third room where i
saw a very comely mare together with a colt and foal sitting on their
haunches upon mats of straw not unartfully made and perfectly neat and
clean

the mare soon after my entrance rose from her mat and coming up close
after having nicely observed my hands and face gave me a most
contemptuous look and turning to the horse i heard the word yahoo
often repeated betwixt them the meaning of which word i could not then
comprehend although it was the first i had learned to pronounce  but i
was soon better informed to my everlasting mortification for the horse
beckoning to me with his head and repeating the hhuun hhuun as he
did upon the road which i understood was to attend him led me out into
a kind of court where was another building at some distance from the
house  here we entered and i saw three of those detestable creatures
which i first met after my landing feeding upon roots and the flesh of
some animals which i afterwards found to be that of asses and dogs and
now and then a cow dead by accident or disease  they were all tied by
the neck with strong withes fastened to a beam they held their food
between the claws of their fore feet and tore it with their teeth

the master horse ordered a sorrel nag one of his servants to untie the
largest of these animals and take him into the yard  the beast and i
were brought close together and by our countenances diligently compared
both by master and servant who thereupon repeated several times the word
yahoo  my horror and astonishment are not to be described when i
observed in this abominable animal a perfect human figure the face of
it indeed was flat and broad the nose depressed the lips large and the
mouth wide but these differences are common to all savage nations where
the lineaments of the countenance are distorted by the natives suffering
their infants to lie grovelling on the earth or by carrying them on
their backs nuzzling with their face against the mothers shoulders
the fore-feet of the yahoo differed from my hands in nothing else but
the length of the nails the coarseness and brownness of the palms and
the hairiness on the backs  there was the same resemblance between our
feet with the same differences which i knew very well though the
horses did not because of my shoes and stockings the same in every part
of our bodies except as to hairiness and colour which i have already
described

the great difficulty that seemed to stick with the two horses was to see
the rest of my body so very different from that of a yahoo for which i
was obliged to my clothes whereof they had no conception  the sorrel
nag offered me a root which he held (after their manner as we shall
describe in its proper place) between his hoof and pastern i took it in
my hand and having smelt it returned it to him again as civilly as i
could  he brought out of the yahoos kennel a piece of asss flesh
but it smelt so offensively that i turned from it with loathing he then
threw it to the yahoo by whom it was greedily devoured  he afterwards
showed me a wisp of hay and a fetlock full of oats but i shook my head
to signify that neither of these were food for me  and indeed i now
apprehended that i must absolutely starve if i did not get to some of my
own species for as to those filthy yahoos although there were few
greater lovers of mankind at that time than myself yet i confess i never
saw any sensitive being so detestable on all accounts and the more i
came near them the more hateful they grew while i stayed in that
country  this the master horse observed by my behaviour and therefore
sent the yahoo back to his kennel  he then put his fore-hoof to his
mouth at which i was much surprised although he did it with ease and
with a motion that appeared perfectly natural and made other signs to
know what i would eat but i could not return him such an answer as he
was able to apprehend and if he had understood me i did not see how it
was possible to contrive any way for finding myself nourishment  while
we were thus engaged i observed a cow passing by whereupon i pointed to
her and expressed a desire to go and milk her  this had its effect for
he led me back into the house and ordered a mare-servant to open a room
where a good store of milk lay in earthen and wooden vessels after a
very orderly and cleanly manner  she gave me a large bowlful of which i
drank very heartily and found myself well refreshed

about noon i saw coming towards the house a kind of vehicle drawn like a
sledge by four yahoos  there was in it an old steed who seemed to be
of quality he alighted with his hind-feet forward having by accident
got a hurt in his left fore-foot  he came to dine with our horse who
received him with great civility  they dined in the best room and had
oats boiled in milk for the second course which the old horse ate warm
but the rest cold  their mangers were placed circular in the middle of
the room and divided into several partitions round which they sat on
their haunches upon bosses of straw  in the middle was a large rack
with angles answering to every partition of the manger so that each
horse and mare ate their own hay and their own mash of oats and milk
with much decency and regularity  the behaviour of the young colt and
foal appeared very modest and that of the master and mistress extremely
cheerful and complaisant to their guest  the gray ordered me to stand by
him and much discourse passed between him and his friend concerning me
as i found by the strangers often looking on me and the frequent
repetition of the word yahoo

i happened to wear my gloves which the master gray observing seemed
perplexed discovering signs of wonder what i had done to my fore-feet
he put his hoof three or four times to them as if he would signify that
i should reduce them to their former shape which i presently did
pulling off both my gloves and putting them into my pocket  this
occasioned farther talk and i saw the company was pleased with my
behaviour whereof i soon found the good effects  i was ordered to speak
the few words i understood and while they were at dinner the master
taught me the names for oats milk fire water and some others which i
could readily pronounce after him having from my youth a great facility
in learning languages

when dinner was done the master horse took me aside and by signs and
words made me understand the concern he was in that i had nothing to eat
oats in their tongue are called hlunnh  this word i pronounced two or
three times for although i had refused them at first yet upon second
thoughts i considered that i could contrive to make of them a kind of
bread which might be sufficient with milk to keep me alive till i
could make my escape to some other country and to creatures of my own
species  the horse immediately ordered a white mare servant of his
family to bring me a good quantity of oats in a sort of wooden tray
these i heated before the fire as well as i could and rubbed them till
the husks came off which i made a shift to winnow from the grain  i
ground and beat them between two stones then took water and made them
into a paste or cake which i toasted at the fire and eat warm with milk
it was at first a very insipid diet though common enough in many parts
of europe but grew tolerable by time and having been often reduced to
hard fare in my life this was not the first experiment i had made how
easily nature is satisfied  and i cannot but observe that i never had
one hours sickness while i stayed in this island  it is true i
sometimes made a shift to catch a rabbit or bird by springs made of
yahoos hairs and i often gathered wholesome herbs which i boiled
and ate as salads with my bread and now and then for a rarity i made a
little butter and drank the whey  i was at first at a great loss for
salt but custom soon reconciled me to the want of it and i am confident
that the frequent use of salt among us is an effect of luxury and was
first introduced only as a provocative to drink except where it is
necessary for preserving flesh in long voyages or in places remote from
great markets for we observe no animal to be fond of it but man and as
to myself when i left this country it was a great while before i could
endure the taste of it in anything that i ate

this is enough to say upon the subject of my diet wherewith other
travellers fill their books as if the readers were personally concerned
whether we fare well or ill  however it was necessary to mention this
matter lest the world should think it impossible that i could find
sustenance for three years in such a country and among such inhabitants

when it grew towards evening the master horse ordered a place for me to
lodge in it was but six yards from the house and separated from the
stable of the yahoos  here i got some straw and covering myself with
my own clothes slept very sound  but i was in a short time better
accommodated as the reader shall know hereafter when i come to treat
more particularly about my way of living



chapter iii


the author studies to learn the language  the houyhnhnm his master
assists in teaching him  the language described  several houyhnhnms of
quality come out of curiosity to see the author  he gives his master a
short account of his voyage

my principal endeavour was to learn the language which my master (for so
i shall henceforth call him) and his children and every servant of his
house were desirous to teach me for they looked upon it as a prodigy
that a brute animal should discover such marks of a rational creature  i
pointed to every thing and inquired the name of it which i wrote down
in my journal-book when i was alone and corrected my bad accent by
desiring those of the family to pronounce it often  in this employment
a sorrel nag one of the under-servants was very ready to assist me

in speaking they pronounced through the nose and throat and their
language approaches nearest to the high-dutch or german of any i know
in europe but is much more graceful and significant  the emperor
charles v made almost the same observation when he said “that if he
were to speak to his horse it should be in high-dutch”

the curiosity and impatience of my master were so great that he spent
many hours of his leisure to instruct me  he was convinced (as he
afterwards told me) that i must be a yahoo but my teachableness
civility and cleanliness astonished him which were qualities
altogether opposite to those animals  he was most perplexed about my
clothes reasoning sometimes with himself whether they were a part of my
body for i never pulled them off till the family were asleep and got
them on before they waked in the morning  my master was eager to learn
“whence i came how i acquired those appearances of reason which i
discovered in all my actions and to know my story from my own mouth
which he hoped he should soon do by the great proficiency i made in
learning and pronouncing their words and sentences”  to help my memory
i formed all i learned into the english alphabet and writ the words
down with the translations  this last after some time i ventured to
do in my masters presence  it cost me much trouble to explain to him
what i was doing for the inhabitants have not the least idea of books or
literature

in about ten weeks time i was able to understand most of his questions
and in three months could give him some tolerable answers  he was
extremely curious to know “from what part of the country i came and how
i was taught to imitate a rational creature because the yahoos (whom
he saw i exactly resembled in my head hands and face that were only
visible) with some appearance of cunning and the strongest disposition
to mischief were observed to be the most unteachable of all brutes”  i
answered “that i came over the sea from a far place with many others
of my own kind in a great hollow vessel made of the bodies of trees
that my companions forced me to land on this coast and then left me to
shift for myself”  it was with some difficulty and by the help of many
signs that i brought him to understand me  he replied “that i must
needs be mistaken or that i said the thing which was not” for they have
no word in their language to express lying or falsehood  “he knew it was
impossible that there could be a country beyond the sea or that a parcel
of brutes could move a wooden vessel whither they pleased upon water  he
was sure no houyhnhnm alive could make such a vessel nor would trust
yahoos to manage it”

the word houyhnhnm in their tongue signifies a horse and in its
etymology the perfection of nature  i told my master “that i was at
a loss for expression but would improve as fast as i could and hoped
in a short time i should be able to tell him wonders”  he was pleased
to direct his own mare his colt and foal and the servants of the
family to take all opportunities of instructing me and every day for
two or three hours he was at the same pains himself  several horses and
mares of quality in the neighbourhood came often to our house upon the
report spread of “a wonderful yahoo that could speak like a
houyhnhnm and seemed in his words and actions to discover some
glimmerings of reason”  these delighted to converse with me they put
many questions and received such answers as i was able to return  by
all these advantages i made so great a progress that in five months
from my arrival i understood whatever was spoken and could express
myself tolerably well

the houyhnhnms who came to visit my master out of a design of seeing
and talking with me could hardly believe me to be a right yahoo
because my body had a different covering from others of my kind  they
were astonished to observe me without the usual hair or skin except on
my head face and hands but i discovered that secret to my master upon
an accident which happened about a fortnight before

i have already told the reader that every night when the family were
gone to bed it was my custom to strip and cover myself with my clothes
it happened one morning early that my master sent for me by the sorrel
nag who was his valet  when he came i was fast asleep my clothes
fallen off on one side and my shirt above my waist  i awaked at the
noise he made and observed him to deliver his message in some disorder
after which he went to my master and in a great fright gave him a very
confused account of what he had seen  this i presently discovered for
going as soon as i was dressed to pay my attendance upon his honour he
asked me “the meaning of what his servant had reported that i was not
the same thing when i slept as i appeared to be at other times that his
vale assured him some part of me was white some yellow at least not so
white and some brown”

i had hitherto concealed the secret of my dress in order to distinguish
myself as much as possible from that cursed race of yahoos but now i
found it in vain to do so any longer  besides i considered that my
clothes and shoes would soon wear out which already were in a declining
condition and must be supplied by some contrivance from the hides of
yahoos or other brutes whereby the whole secret would be known  i
therefore told my master “that in the country whence i came those of my
kind always covered their bodies with the hairs of certain animals
prepared by art as well for decency as to avoid the inclemencies of air
both hot and cold of which as to my own person i would give him
immediate conviction if he pleased to command me only desiring his
excuse if i did not expose those parts that nature taught us to
conceal”  he said “my discourse was all very strange but especially
the last part for he could not understand why nature should teach us to
conceal what nature had given that neither himself nor family were
ashamed of any parts of their bodies but however i might do as i
pleased”  whereupon i first unbuttoned my coat and pulled it off  i
did the same with my waistcoat  i drew off my shoes stockings and
breeches  i let my shirt down to my waist and drew up the bottom
fastening it like a girdle about my middle to hide my nakedness

my master observed the whole performance with great signs of curiosity
and admiration  he took up all my clothes in his pastern one piece
after another and examined them diligently he then stroked my body very
gently and looked round me several times after which he said it was
plain i must be a perfect yahoo but that i differed very much from the
rest of my species in the softness whiteness and smoothness of my skin
my want of hair in several parts of my body the shape and shortness of
my claws behind and before and my affectation of walking continually on
my two hinder feet  he desired to see no more and gave me leave to put
on my clothes again for i was shuddering with cold

i expressed my uneasiness at his giving me so often the appellation of
yahoo an odious animal for which i had so utter a hatred and
contempt i begged he would forbear applying that word to me and make
the same order in his family and among his friends whom he suffered to
see me  i requested likewise “that the secret of my having a false
covering to my body might be known to none but himself at least as long
as my present clothing should last for as to what the sorrel nag his
valet had observed his honour might command him to conceal it”

all this my master very graciously consented to and thus the secret was
kept till my clothes began to wear out which i was forced to supply by
several contrivances that shall hereafter be mentioned  in the meantime
he desired “i would go on with my utmost diligence to learn their
language because he was more astonished at my capacity for speech and
reason than at the figure of my body whether it were covered or not”
adding “that he waited with some impatience to hear the wonders which i
promised to tell him”

thenceforward he doubled the pains he had been at to instruct me he
brought me into all company and made them treat me with civility
“because” as he told them privately “this would put me into good
humour and make me more diverting”

every day when i waited on him beside the trouble he was at in
teaching he would ask me several questions concerning myself which i
answered as well as i could and by these means he had already received
some general ideas though very imperfect  it would be tedious to relate
the several steps by which i advanced to a more regular conversation but
the first account i gave of myself in any order and length was to this
purpose

“that i came from a very far country as i already had attempted to tell
him with about fifty more of my own species that we travelled upon the
seas in a great hollow vessel made of wood and larger than his honours
house  i described the ship to him in the best terms i could and
explained by the help of my handkerchief displayed how it was driven
forward by the wind  that upon a quarrel among us i was set on shore on
this coast where i walked forward without knowing whither till he
delivered me from the persecution of those execrable yahoos”  he asked
me “who made the ship and how it was possible that the houyhnhnms of
my country would leave it to the management of brutes?”  my answer was
“that i durst proceed no further in my relation unless he would give me
his word and honour that he would not be offended and then i would tell
him the wonders i had so often promised”  he agreed and i went on by
assuring him that the ship was made by creatures like myself who in
all the countries i had travelled as well as in my own were the only
governing rational animals and that upon my arrival hither i was as
much astonished to see the houyhnhnms act like rational beings as he
or his friends could be in finding some marks of reason in a creature
he was pleased to call a yahoo to which i owned my resemblance in
every part but could not account for their degenerate and brutal nature
i said farther “that if good fortune ever restored me to my native
country to relate my travels hither as i resolved to do everybody
would believe that i said the thing that was not that i invented the
story out of my own head and (with all possible respect to himself his
family and friends and under his promise of not being offended) our
countrymen would hardly think it probable that a houyhnhnm should be
the presiding creature of a nation and a yahoo the brute”



chapter iv


the houyhnhnms notion of truth and falsehood  the authors discourse
disapproved by his master  the author gives a more particular account of
himself and the accidents of his voyage

my master heard me with great appearances of uneasiness in his
countenance because doubting or not believing are so little known in
this country that the inhabitants cannot tell how to behave themselves
under such circumstances  and i remember in frequent discourses with my
master concerning the nature of manhood in other parts of the world
having occasion to talk of lying and false representation it was with
much difficulty that he comprehended what i meant although he had
otherwise a most acute judgment  for he argued thus “that the use of
speech was to make us understand one another and to receive information
of facts now if any one said the thing which was not these ends were
defeated because i cannot properly be said to understand him and i am
so far from receiving information that he leaves me worse than in
ignorance for i am led to believe a thing black when it is white and
short when it is long”  and these were all the notions he had
concerning that faculty of lying so perfectly well understood and so
universally practised among human creatures

to return from this digression  when i asserted that the yahoos were
the only governing animals in my country which my master said was
altogether past his conception he desired to know “whether we had
houyhnhnms among us and what was their employment?”  i told him “we
had great numbers that in summer they grazed in the fields and in
winter were kept in houses with hay and oats where yahoo servants were
employed to rub their skins smooth comb their manes pick their feet
serve them with food and make their beds”  “i understand you well”
said my master “it is now very plain from all you have spoken that
whatever share of reason the yahoos pretend to the houyhnhnms are
your masters i heartily wish our yahoos would be so tractable”  i
begged “his honour would please to excuse me from proceeding any further
because i was very certain that the account he expected from me would be
highly displeasing”  but he insisted in commanding me to let him know
the best and the worst  i told him “he should be obeyed”  i owned “that
the houyhnhnms among us whom we called horses were the most generous
and comely animals we had that they excelled in strength and swiftness
and when they belonged to persons of quality were employed in
travelling racing or drawing chariots they were treated with much
kindness and care till they fell into diseases or became foundered in
the feet but then they were sold and used to all kind of drudgery till
they died after which their skins were stripped and sold for what they
were worth and their bodies left to be devoured by dogs and birds of
prey  but the common race of horses had not so good fortune being kept
by farmers and carriers and other mean people who put them to greater
labour and fed them worse”  i described as well as i could our way of
riding the shape and use of a bridle a saddle a spur and a whip of
harness and wheels  i added “that we fastened plates of a certain hard
substance called iron at the bottom of their feet to preserve their
hoofs from being broken by the stony ways on which we often travelled”

my master after some expressions of great indignation wondered “how we
dared to venture upon a houyhnhnms back for he was sure that the
weakest servant in his house would be able to shake off the strongest
yahoo or by lying down and rolling on his back squeeze the brute to
death”  i answered “that our horses were trained up from three or four
years old to the several uses we intended them for that if any of them
proved intolerably vicious they were employed for carriages that they
were severely beaten while they were young for any mischievous tricks
that the males designed for the common use of riding or draught were
generally castrated about two years after their birth to take down their
spirits and make them more tame and gentle that they were indeed
sensible of rewards and punishments but his honour would please to
consider that they had not the least tincture of reason any more than
the yahoos in this country”

it put me to the pains of many circumlocutions to give my master a right
idea of what i spoke for their language does not abound in variety of
words because their wants and passions are fewer than among us  but it
is impossible to express his noble resentment at our savage treatment of
the houyhnhnm race particularly after i had explained the manner and
use of castrating horses among us to hinder them from propagating their
kind and to render them more servile  he said “if it were possible
there could be any country where yahoos alone were endued with reason
they certainly must be the governing animal because reason in time will
always prevail against brutal strength  but considering the frame of
our bodies and especially of mine he thought no creature of equal bulk
was so ill-contrived for employing that reason in the common offices of
life” whereupon he desired to know “whether those among whom i lived
resembled me or the yahoos of his country?”  i assured him “that i
was as well shaped as most of my age but the younger and the females
were much more soft and tender and the skins of the latter generally as
white as milk”  he said “i differed indeed from other yahoos being
much more cleanly and not altogether so deformed but in point of real
advantage he thought i differed for the worse that my nails were of no
use either to my fore or hinder feet as to my fore feet he could not
properly call them by that name for he never observed me to walk upon
them that they were too soft to bear the ground that i generally went
with them uncovered neither was the covering i sometimes wore on them of
the same shape or so strong as that on my feet behind that i could not
walk with any security for if either of my hinder feet slipped i must
inevitably fall”  he then began to find fault with other parts of my
body “the flatness of my face the prominence of my nose mine eyes
placed directly in front so that i could not look on either side without
turning my head that i was not able to feed myself without lifting one
of my fore-feet to my mouth and therefore nature had placed those joints
to answer that necessity  he knew not what could be the use of those
several clefts and divisions in my feet behind that these were too soft
to bear the hardness and sharpness of stones without a covering made
from the skin of some other brute that my whole body wanted a fence
against heat and cold which i was forced to put on and off every day
with tediousness and trouble and lastly that he observed every animal
in this country naturally to abhor the yahoos whom the weaker avoided
and the stronger drove from them  so that supposing us to have the gift
of reason he could not see how it were possible to cure that natural
antipathy which every creature discovered against us nor consequently
how we could tame and render them serviceable  however he would” as he
said “debate the matter no farther because he was more desirous to know
my own story the country where i was born and the several actions and
events of my life before i came hither”

i assured him “how extremely desirous i was that he should be satisfied
on every point but i doubted much whether it would be possible for me
to explain myself on several subjects whereof his honour could have no
conception because i saw nothing in his country to which i could
resemble them that however i would do my best and strive to express
myself by similitudes humbly desiring his assistance when i wanted
proper words” which he was pleased to promise me

i said “my birth was of honest parents in an island called england
which was remote from his country as many days journey as the strongest
of his honours servants could travel in the annual course of the sun
that i was bred a surgeon whose trade it is to cure wounds and hurts in
the body gotten by accident or violence that my country was governed by
a female man whom we called queen that i left it to get riches whereby
i might maintain myself and family when i should return that in my
last voyage i was commander of the ship and had about fifty yahoos
under me many of which died at sea and i was forced to supply them by
others picked out from several nations that our ship was twice in danger
of being sunk the first time by a great storm and the second by
striking against a rock”  here my master interposed by asking me “how
i could persuade strangers out of different countries to venture with
me after the losses i had sustained and the hazards i had run?”  i
said “they were fellows of desperate fortunes forced to fly from the
places of their birth on account of their poverty or their crimes  some
were undone by lawsuits others spent all they had in drinking whoring
and gaming others fled for treason many for murder theft poisoning
robbery perjury forgery coining false money for committing rapes or
sodomy for flying from their colours or deserting to the enemy and
most of them had broken prison none of these durst return to their
native countries for fear of being hanged or of starving in a jail and
therefore they were under the necessity of seeking a livelihood in other
places”

during this discourse my master was pleased to interrupt me several
times  i had made use of many circumlocutions in describing to him the
nature of the several crimes for which most of our crew had been forced
to fly their country  this labour took up several days conversation
before he was able to comprehend me  he was wholly at a loss to know
what could be the use or necessity of practising those vices  to clear
up which i endeavoured to give some ideas of the desire of power and
riches of the terrible effects of lust intemperance malice and envy
all this i was forced to define and describe by putting cases and making
suppositions  after which like one whose imagination was struck with
something never seen or heard of before he would lift up his eyes with
amazement and indignation  power government war law punishment and
a thousand other things had no terms wherein that language could express
them which made the difficulty almost insuperable to give my master any
conception of what i meant  but being of an excellent understanding
much improved by contemplation and converse he at last arrived at a
competent knowledge of what human nature in our parts of the world is
capable to perform and desired i would give him some particular account
of that land which we call europe but especially of my own country



chapter v


the author at his masters command informs him of the state of england
the causes of war among the princes of europe  the author begins to
explain the english constitution

the reader may please to observe that the following extract of many
conversations i had with my master contains a summary of the most
material points which were discoursed at several times for above two
years his honour often desiring fuller satisfaction as i farther
improved in the houyhnhnm tongue  i laid before him as well as i
could the whole state of europe i discoursed of trade and manufactures
of arts and sciences and the answers i gave to all the questions he
made as they arose upon several subjects were a fund of conversation
not to be exhausted  but i shall here only set down the substance of
what passed between us concerning my own country reducing it in order as
well as i can without any regard to time or other circumstances while i
strictly adhere to truth  my only concern is that i shall hardly be
able to do justice to my masters arguments and expressions which must
needs suffer by my want of capacity as well as by a translation into our
barbarous english

in obedience therefore to his honours commands i related to him the
revolution under the prince of orange the long war with france entered
into by the said prince and renewed by his successor the present queen
wherein the greatest powers of christendom were engaged and which still
continued i computed at his request “that about a million of yahoos
might have been killed in the whole progress of it and perhaps a hundred
or more cities taken and five times as many ships burnt or sunk”

he asked me “what were the usual causes or motives that made one country
go to war with another?”  i answered “they were innumerable but i should
only mention a few of the chief  sometimes the ambition of princes who
never think they have land or people enough to govern sometimes the
corruption of ministers who engage their master in a war in order to
stifle or divert the clamour of the subjects against their evil
administration  difference in opinions has cost many millions of lives
for instance whether flesh be bread or bread be flesh whether the
juice of a certain berry be blood or wine whether whistling be a vice or
a virtue whether it be better to kiss a post or throw it into the fire
what is the best colour for a coat whether black white red or gray
and whether it should be long or short narrow or wide dirty or clean
with many more  neither are any wars so furious and bloody or of so
long a continuance as those occasioned by difference in opinion
especially if it be in things indifferent

“sometimes the quarrel between two princes is to decide which of them
shall dispossess a third of his dominions where neither of them pretend
to any right  sometimes one prince quarrels with another for fear the
other should quarrel with him  sometimes a war is entered upon because
the enemy is too strong and sometimes because he is too weak
sometimes our neighbours want the things which we have or have the
things which we want and we both fight till they take ours or give us
theirs  it is a very justifiable cause of a war to invade a country
after the people have been wasted by famine destroyed by pestilence or
embroiled by factions among themselves  it is justifiable to enter into
war against our nearest ally when one of his towns lies convenient for
us or a territory of land that would render our dominions round and
complete  if a prince sends forces into a nation where the people are
poor and ignorant he may lawfully put half of them to death and make
slaves of the rest in order to civilize and reduce them from their
barbarous way of living  it is a very kingly honourable and frequent
practice when one prince desires the assistance of another to secure
him against an invasion that the assistant when he has driven out the
invader should seize on the dominions himself and kill imprison or
banish the prince he came to relieve  alliance by blood or marriage
is a frequent cause of war between princes and the nearer the kindred
is the greater their disposition to quarrel poor nations are hungry
and rich nations are proud and pride and hunger will ever be at
variance  for these reasons the trade of a soldier is held the most
honourable of all others because a soldier is a yahoo hired to kill
in cold blood as many of his own species who have never offended him
as possibly he can

“there is likewise a kind of beggarly princes in europe not able to make
war by themselves who hire out their troops to richer nations for so
much a day to each man of which they keep three-fourths to themselves
and it is the best part of their maintenance such are those in many
northern parts of europe”

“what you have told me” said my master “upon the subject of war does
indeed discover most admirably the effects of that reason you pretend to
however it is happy that the shame is greater than the danger and that
nature has left you utterly incapable of doing much mischief  for your
mouths lying flat with your faces you can hardly bite each other to any
purpose unless by consent  then as to the claws upon your feet before
and behind they are so short and tender that one of our yahoos would
drive a dozen of yours before him  and therefore in recounting the
numbers of those who have been killed in battle i cannot but think you
have said the thing which is not”

i could not forbear shaking my head and smiling a little at his
ignorance  and being no stranger to the art of war i gave him a
description of cannons culverins muskets carabines pistols bullets
powder swords bayonets battles sieges retreats attacks undermines
countermines bombardments sea fights ships sunk with a thousand men
twenty thousand killed on each side dying groans limbs flying in the
air smoke noise confusion trampling to death under horses feet
flight pursuit victory fields strewed with carcases left for food to
dogs and wolves and birds of prey plundering stripping ravishing
burning and destroying  and to set forth the valour of my own dear
countrymen i assured him “that i had seen them blow up a hundred
enemies at once in a siege and as many in a ship and beheld the dead
bodies drop down in pieces from the clouds to the great diversion of the
spectators”

i was going on to more particulars when my master commanded me silence
he said “whoever understood the nature of yahoos might easily believe
it possible for so vile an animal to be capable of every action i had
named if their strength and cunning equalled their malice  but as my
discourse had increased his abhorrence of the whole species so he found
it gave him a disturbance in his mind to which he was wholly a stranger
before  he thought his ears being used to such abominable words might
by degrees admit them with less detestation that although he hated the
yahoos of this country yet he no more blamed them for their odious
qualities than he did a gnnayh (a bird of prey) for its cruelty or a
sharp stone for cutting his hoof  but when a creature pretending to
reason could be capable of such enormities he dreaded lest the
corruption of that faculty might be worse than brutality itself  he
seemed therefore confident that instead of reason we were only
possessed of some quality fitted to increase our natural vices as the
reflection from a troubled stream returns the image of an ill shapen
body not only larger but more distorted”

he added “that he had heard too much upon the subject of war both in
this and some former discourses  there was another point which a little
perplexed him at present  i had informed him that some of our crew left
their country on account of being ruined by law that i had already
explained the meaning of the word but he was at a loss how it should
come to pass that the law which was intended for every mans
preservation should be any mans ruin  therefore he desired to be
further satisfied what i meant by law and the dispensers thereof
according to the present practice in my own country because he thought
nature and reason were sufficient guides for a reasonable animal as we
pretended to be in showing us what he ought to do and what to avoid”

i assured his honour “that the law was a science in which i had not much
conversed further than by employing advocates in vain upon some
injustices that had been done me however i would give him all the
satisfaction i was able”

i said “there was a society of men among us bred up from their youth in
the art of proving by words multiplied for the purpose that white is
black and black is white according as they are paid  to this society
all the rest of the people are slaves  for example if my neighbour has
a mind to my cow he has a lawyer to prove that he ought to have my cow
from me  i must then hire another to defend my right it being against
all rules of law that any man should be allowed to speak for himself
now in this case i who am the right owner lie under two great
disadvantages first my lawyer being practised almost from his cradle
in defending falsehood is quite out of his element when he would be an
advocate for justice which is an unnatural office he always attempts
with great awkwardness if not with ill-will  the second disadvantage
is that my lawyer must proceed with great caution or else he will be
reprimanded by the judges and abhorred by his brethren as one that
would lessen the practice of the law  and therefore i have but two
methods to preserve my cow  the first is to gain over my adversarys
lawyer with a double fee who will then betray his client by insinuating
that he hath justice on his side  the second way is for my lawyer to
make my cause appear as unjust as he can by allowing the cow to belong
to my adversary and this if it be skilfully done will certainly
bespeak the favour of the bench  now your honour is to know that these
judges are persons appointed to decide all controversies of property as
well as for the trial of criminals and picked out from the most
dexterous lawyers who are grown old or lazy and having been biassed all
their lives against truth and equity lie under such a fatal necessity of
favouring fraud perjury and oppression that i have known some of them
refuse a large bribe from the side where justice lay rather than injure
the faculty by doing any thing unbecoming their nature or their office

“it is a maxim among these lawyers that whatever has been done before
may legally be done again and therefore they take special care to record
all the decisions formerly made against common justice and the general
reason of mankind  these under the name of precedents they produce as
authorities to justify the most iniquitous opinions and the judges never
fail of directing accordingly

“in pleading they studiously avoid entering into the merits of the
cause but are loud violent and tedious in dwelling upon all
circumstances which are not to the purpose  for instance in the case
already mentioned they never desire to know what claim or title my
adversary has to my cow but whether the said cow were red or black her
horns long or short whether the field i graze her in be round or square
whether she was milked at home or abroad what diseases she is subject
to and the like after which they consult precedents adjourn the cause
from time to time and in ten twenty or thirty years come to an issue

“it is likewise to be observed that this society has a peculiar cant and
jargon of their own that no other mortal can understand and wherein all
their laws are written which they take special care to multiply whereby
they have wholly confounded the very essence of truth and falsehood of
right and wrong so that it will take thirty years to decide whether the
field left me by my ancestors for six generations belongs to me or to a
stranger three hundred miles off

“in the trial of persons accused for crimes against the state the method
is much more short and commendable the judge first sends to sound the
disposition of those in power after which he can easily hang or save a
criminal strictly preserving all due forms of law”

here my master interposing said “it was a pity that creatures endowed
with such prodigious abilities of mind as these lawyers by the
description i gave of them must certainly be were not rather encouraged
to be instructors of others in wisdom and knowledge”  in answer to which
i assured his honour “that in all points out of their own trade they
were usually the most ignorant and stupid generation among us the most
despicable in common conversation avowed enemies to all knowledge and
learning and equally disposed to pervert the general reason of mankind
in every other subject of discourse as in that of their own profession”



chapter vi


a continuation of the state of england under queen anne  the character
of a first minister of state in european courts

my master was yet wholly at a loss to understand what motives could
incite this race of lawyers to perplex disquiet and weary themselves
and engage in a confederacy of injustice merely for the sake of injuring
their fellow-animals neither could he comprehend what i meant in saying
they did it for hire  whereupon i was at much pains to describe to him
the use of money the materials it was made of and the value of the
metals “that when a yahoo had got a great store of this precious
substance he was able to purchase whatever he had a mind to the finest
clothing the noblest houses great tracts of land the most costly meats
and drinks and have his choice of the most beautiful females  therefore
since money alone was able to perform all these feats our yahoos
thought they could never have enough of it to spend or to save as they
found themselves inclined from their natural bent either to profusion or
avarice that the rich man enjoyed the fruit of the poor mans labour
and the latter were a thousand to one in proportion to the former that
the bulk of our people were forced to live miserably by labouring every
day for small wages to make a few live plentifully”

i enlarged myself much on these and many other particulars to the same
purpose but his honour was still to seek for he went upon a
supposition that all animals had a title to their share in the
productions of the earth and especially those who presided over the
rest  therefore he desired i would let him know “what these costly
meats were and how any of us happened to want them?”  whereupon i
enumerated as many sorts as came into my head with the various methods
of dressing them which could not be done without sending vessels by sea
to every part of the world as well for liquors to drink as for sauces
and innumerable other conveniences  i assured him “that this whole globe
of earth must be at least three times gone round before one of our better
female yahoos could get her breakfast or a cup to put it in”  he said
“that must needs be a miserable country which cannot furnish food for its
own inhabitants  but what he chiefly wondered at was how such vast
tracts of ground as i described should be wholly without fresh water and
the people put to the necessity of sending over the sea for drink”  i
replied “that england (the dear place of my nativity) was computed to
produce three times the quantity of food more than its inhabitants are
able to consume as well as liquors extracted from grain or pressed out
of the fruit of certain trees which made excellent drink and the same
proportion in every other convenience of life  but in order to feed the
luxury and intemperance of the males and the vanity of the females we
sent away the greatest part of our necessary things to other countries
whence in return we brought the materials of diseases folly and vice
to spend among ourselves  hence it follows of necessity that vast
numbers of our people are compelled to seek their livelihood by begging
robbing stealing cheating pimping flattering suborning forswearing
forging gaming lying fawning hectoring voting scribbling
star-gazing poisoning whoring canting libelling freethinking and
the like occupations” every one of which terms i was at much pains to
make him understand

“that wine was not imported among us from foreign countries to supply the
want of water or other drinks but because it was a sort of liquid which
made us merry by putting us out of our senses diverted all melancholy
thoughts begat wild extravagant imaginations in the brain raised our
hopes and banished our fears suspended every office of reason for a
time and deprived us of the use of our limbs till we fell into a
profound sleep although it must be confessed that we always awaked sick
and dispirited and that the use of this liquor filled us with diseases
which made our lives uncomfortable and short

“but beside all this the bulk of our people supported themselves by
furnishing the necessities or conveniences of life to the rich and to
each other  for instance when i am at home and dressed as i ought to
be i carry on my body the workmanship of a hundred tradesmen the
building and furniture of my house employ as many more and five times
the number to adorn my wife”

i was going on to tell him of another sort of people who get their
livelihood by attending the sick having upon some occasions informed
his honour that many of my crew had died of diseases  but here it was
with the utmost difficulty that i brought him to apprehend what i meant
“he could easily conceive that a houyhnhnm grew weak and heavy a few
days before his death or by some accident might hurt a limb but that
nature who works all things to perfection should suffer any pains to
breed in our bodies he thought impossible and desired to know the
reason of so unaccountable an evil”

i told him “we fed on a thousand things which operated contrary to each
other that we ate when we were not hungry and drank without the
provocation of thirst that we sat whole nights drinking strong liquors
without eating a bit which disposed us to sloth inflamed our bodies
and precipitated or prevented digestion that prostitute female yahoos
acquired a certain malady which bred rottenness in the bones of those
who fell into their embraces that this and many other diseases were
propagated from father to son so that great numbers came into the world
with complicated maladies upon them that it would be endless to give him
a catalogue of all diseases incident to human bodies for they would not
be fewer than five or six hundred spread over every limb and joint—in
short every part external and intestine having diseases appropriated
to itself  to remedy which there was a sort of people bred up among us
in the profession or pretence of curing the sick  and because i had
some skill in the faculty i would in gratitude to his honour let him
know the whole mystery and method by which they proceed

“their fundamental is that all diseases arise from repletion whence
they conclude that a great evacuation of the body is necessary either
through the natural passage or upwards at the mouth  their next business
is from herbs minerals gums oils shells salts juices sea-weed
excrements barks of trees serpents toads frogs spiders dead mens
flesh and bones birds beasts and fishes to form a composition for
smell and taste the most abominable nauseous and detestable they can
possibly contrive which the stomach immediately rejects with loathing
and this they call a vomit or else from the same store-house with some
other poisonous additions they command us to take in at the orifice
above or below (just as the physician then happens to be disposed) a
medicine equally annoying and disgustful to the bowels which relaxing
the belly drives down all before it and this they call a purge or a
clyster  for nature (as the physicians allege) having intended the
superior anterior orifice only for the intromission of solids and
liquids and the inferior posterior for ejection these artists
ingeniously considering that in all diseases nature is forced out of her
seat therefore to replace her in it the body must be treated in a
manner directly contrary by interchanging the use of each orifice
forcing solids and liquids in at the anus and making evacuations at the
mouth

“but besides real diseases we are subject to many that are only
imaginary for which the physicians have invented imaginary cures these
have their several names and so have the drugs that are proper for them
and with these our female yahoos are always infested

“one great excellency in this tribe is their skill at prognostics
wherein they seldom fail their predictions in real diseases when they
rise to any degree of malignity generally portending death which is
always in their power when recovery is not and therefore upon any
unexpected signs of amendment after they have pronounced their sentence
rather than be accused as false prophets they know how to approve their
sagacity to the world by a seasonable dose

“they are likewise of special use to husbands and wives who are grown
weary of their mates to eldest sons to great ministers of state and
often to princes”

i had formerly upon occasion discoursed with my master upon the nature
of government in general and particularly of our own excellent
constitution deservedly the wonder and envy of the whole world  but
having here accidentally mentioned a minister of state he commanded me
some time after to inform him “what species of yahoo i particularly
meant by that appellation”

i told him “that a first or chief minister of state who was the person
i intended to describe was the creature wholly exempt from joy and
grief love and hatred pity and anger at least makes use of no other
passions but a violent desire of wealth power and titles that he
applies his words to all uses except to the indication of his mind that
he never tells a truth but with an intent that you should take it for a
lie nor a lie but with a design that you should take it for a truth
that those he speaks worst of behind their backs are in the surest way of
preferment and whenever he begins to praise you to others or to
yourself you are from that day forlorn  the worst mark you can receive
is a promise especially when it is confirmed with an oath after which
every wise man retires and gives over all hopes

“there are three methods by which a man may rise to be chief minister
the first is by knowing how with prudence to dispose of a wife a
daughter or a sister the second by betraying or undermining his
predecessor and the third is by a furious zeal in public assemblies
against the corruptions of the court  but a wise prince would rather
choose to employ those who practise the last of these methods because
such zealots prove always the most obsequious and subservient to the will
and passions of their master  that these ministers having all
employments at their disposal preserve themselves in power by bribing
the majority of a senate or great council and at last by an expedient
called an act of indemnity” (whereof i described the nature to him)
“they secure themselves from after-reckonings and retire from the public
laden with the spoils of the nation

“the palace of a chief minister is a seminary to breed up others in his
own trade the pages lackeys and porters by imitating their master
become ministers of state in their several districts and learn to excel
in the three principal ingredients of insolence lying and bribery
accordingly they have a subaltern court paid to them by persons of the
best rank and sometimes by the force of dexterity and impudence arrive
through several gradations to be successors to their lord

“he is usually governed by a decayed wench or favourite footman who are
the tunnels through which all graces are conveyed and may properly be
called in the last resort the governors of the kingdom”

one day in discourse my master having heard me mention the nobility of
my country was pleased to make me a compliment which i could not pretend
to deserve “that he was sure i must have been born of some noble family
because i far exceeded in shape colour and cleanliness all the
yahoos of his nation although i seemed to fail in strength and
agility which must be imputed to my different way of living from those
other brutes and besides i was not only endowed with the faculty of
speech but likewise with some rudiments of reason to a degree that
with all his acquaintance i passed for a prodigy”

he made me observe “that among the houyhnhnms the white the sorrel
and the iron-gray were not so exactly shaped as the bay the
dapple-gray and the black nor born with equal talents of mind or a
capacity to improve them and therefore continued always in the condition
of servants without ever aspiring to match out of their own race which
in that country would be reckoned monstrous and unnatural”

i made his honour my most humble acknowledgments for the good opinion he
was pleased to conceive of me but assured him at the same time “that my
birth was of the lower sort having been born of plain honest parents
who were just able to give me a tolerable education that nobility among
us was altogether a different thing from the idea he had of it that our
young noblemen are bred from their childhood in idleness and luxury
that as soon as years will permit they consume their vigour and
contract odious diseases among lewd females and when their fortunes are
almost ruined they marry some woman of mean birth disagreeable person
and unsound constitution (merely for the sake of money) whom they hate
and despise  that the productions of such marriages are generally
scrofulous rickety or deformed children by which means the family
seldom continues above three generations unless the wife takes care to
provide a healthy father among her neighbours or domestics in order to
improve and continue the breed  that a weak diseased body a meagre
countenance and sallow complexion are the true marks of noble blood
and a healthy robust appearance is so disgraceful in a man of quality
that the world concludes his real father to have been a groom or a
coachman  the imperfections of his mind run parallel with those of his
body being a composition of spleen dullness ignorance caprice
sensuality and pride

“without the consent of this illustrious body no law can be enacted
repealed or altered and these nobles have likewise the decision of all
our possessions without appeal” {514}



chapter vii


the authors great love of his native country  his masters observations
upon the constitution and administration of england as described by the
author with parallel cases and comparisons  his masters observations
upon human nature

the reader may be disposed to wonder how i could prevail on myself to
give so free a representation of my own species among a race of mortals
who are already too apt to conceive the vilest opinion of humankind from
that entire congruity between me and their yahoos  but i must freely
confess that the many virtues of those excellent quadrupeds placed in
opposite view to human corruptions had so far opened my eyes and
enlarged my understanding that i began to view the actions and passions
of man in a very different light and to think the honour of my own kind
not worth managing which besides it was impossible for me to do
before a person of so acute a judgment as my master who daily convinced
me of a thousand faults in myself whereof i had not the least perception
before and which with us would never be numbered even among human
infirmities  i had likewise learned from his example an utter
detestation of all falsehood or disguise and truth appeared so amiable
to me that i determined upon sacrificing every thing to it

let me deal so candidly with the reader as to confess that there was yet
a much stronger motive for the freedom i took in my representation of
things  i had not yet been a year in this country before i contracted
such a love and veneration for the inhabitants that i entered on a firm
resolution never to return to humankind but to pass the rest of my life
among these admirable houyhnhnms in the contemplation and practice of
every virtue where i could have no example or incitement to vice  but
it was decreed by fortune my perpetual enemy that so great a felicity
should not fall to my share  however it is now some comfort to reflect
that in what i said of my countrymen i extenuated their faults as much
as i durst before so strict an examiner and upon every article gave as
favourable a turn as the matter would bear  for indeed who is there
alive that will not be swayed by his bias and partiality to the place of
his birth?

i have related the substance of several conversations i had with my
master during the greatest part of the time i had the honour to be in his
service but have indeed for brevity sake omitted much more than is
here set down

when i had answered all his questions and his curiosity seemed to be
fully satisfied he sent for me one morning early and commanded me to
sit down at some distance (an honour which he had never before conferred
upon me)  he said “he had been very seriously considering my whole
story as far as it related both to myself and my country that he looked
upon us as a sort of animals to whose share by what accident he could
not conjecture some small pittance of reason had fallen whereof we made
no other use than by its assistance to aggravate our natural
corruptions and to acquire new ones which nature had not given us that
we disarmed ourselves of the few abilities she had bestowed had been
very successful in multiplying our original wants and seemed to spend
our whole lives in vain endeavours to supply them by our own inventions
that as to myself it was manifest i had neither the strength nor
agility of a common yahoo that i walked infirmly on my hinder feet
had found out a contrivance to make my claws of no use or defence and to
remove the hair from my chin which was intended as a shelter from the
sun and the weather lastly that i could neither run with speed nor
climb trees like my brethren” as he called them “the yahoos in his
country

“that our institutions of government and law were plainly owing to our
gross defects in reason and by consequence in virtue because reason
alone is sufficient to govern a rational creature which was therefore
a character we had no pretence to challenge even from the account i had
given of my own people although he manifestly perceived that in order
to favour them i had concealed many particulars and often said the
thing which was not

“he was the more confirmed in this opinion because he observed that as
i agreed in every feature of my body with other yahoos except where it
was to my real disadvantage in point of strength speed and activity
the shortness of my claws and some other particulars where nature had no
part so from the representation i had given him of our lives our
manners and our actions he found as near a resemblance in the
disposition of our minds”  he said “the yahoos were known to hate one
another more than they did any different species of animals and the
reason usually assigned was the odiousness of their own shapes which
all could see in the rest but not in themselves  he had therefore begun
to think it not unwise in us to cover our bodies and by that invention
conceal many of our deformities from each other which would else be
hardly supportable  but he now found he had been mistaken and that the
dissensions of those brutes in his country were owing to the same cause
with ours as i had described them  for if” said he “you throw among
five yahoos as much food as would be sufficient for fifty they will
instead of eating peaceably fall together by the ears each single one
impatient to have all to itself and therefore a servant was usually
employed to stand by while they were feeding abroad and those kept at
home were tied at a distance from each other that if a cow died of age
or accident before a houyhnhnm could secure it for his own yahoos
those in the neighbourhood would come in herds to seize it and then
would ensue such a battle as i had described with terrible wounds made
by their claws on both sides although they seldom were able to kill one
another for want of such convenient instruments of death as we had
invented  at other times the like battles have been fought between the
yahoos of several neighbourhoods without any visible cause those of
one district watching all opportunities to surprise the next before they
are prepared  but if they find their project has miscarried they return
home and for want of enemies engage in what i call a civil war among
themselves

“that in some fields of his country there are certain shining stones of
several colours whereof the yahoos are violently fond and when part
of these stones is fixed in the earth as it sometimes happens they will
dig with their claws for whole days to get them out then carry them
away and hide them by heaps in their kennels but still looking round
with great caution for fear their comrades should find out their
treasure”  my master said “he could never discover the reason of this
unnatural appetite or how these stones could be of any use to a yahoo
but now he believed it might proceed from the same principle of avarice
which i had ascribed to mankind  that he had once by way of experiment
privately removed a heap of these stones from the place where one of his
yahoos had buried it whereupon the sordid animal missing his
treasure by his loud lamenting brought the whole herd to the place
there miserably howled then fell to biting and tearing the rest began
to pine away would neither eat nor sleep nor work till he ordered a
servant privately to convey the stones into the same hole and hide them
as before which when his yahoo had found he presently recovered his
spirits and good humour but took good care to remove them to a better
hiding place and has ever since been a very serviceable brute”

my master further assured me which i also observed myself “that in the
fields where the shining stones abound the fiercest and most frequent
battles are fought occasioned by perpetual inroads of the neighbouring
yahoos”

he said “it was common when two yahoos discovered such a stone in a
field and were contending which of them should be the proprietor a
third would take the advantage and carry it away from them both” which
my master would needs contend to have some kind of resemblance with our
suits at law wherein i thought it for our credit not to undeceive him
since the decision he mentioned was much more equitable than many decrees
among us because the plaintiff and defendant there lost nothing beside
the stone they contended for whereas our courts of equity would never
have dismissed the cause while either of them had any thing left

my master continuing his discourse said “there was nothing that
rendered the yahoos more odious than their undistinguishing appetite
to devour every thing that came in their way whether herbs roots
berries the corrupted flesh of animals or all mingled together and it
was peculiar in their temper that they were fonder of what they could
get by rapine or stealth at a greater distance than much better food
provided for them at home  if their prey held out they would eat till
they were ready to burst after which nature had pointed out to them a
certain root that gave them a general evacuation

“there was also another kind of root very juicy but somewhat rare and
difficult to be found which the yahoos sought for with much eagerness
and would suck it with great delight it produced in them the same
effects that wine has upon us  it would make them sometimes hug and
sometimes tear one another they would howl and grin and chatter and
reel and tumble and then fall asleep in the mud”

i did indeed observe that the yahoos were the only animals in this
country subject to any diseases which however were much fewer than
horses have among us and contracted not by any ill-treatment they meet
with but by the nastiness and greediness of that sordid brute  neither
has their language any more than a general appellation for those
maladies which is borrowed from the name of the beast and called
hnea-yahoo or yahoos evil and the cure prescribed is a mixture of
their own dung and urine forcibly put down the yahoos throat  this i
have since often known to have been taken with success and do here
freely recommend it to my countrymen for the public good as an admirable
specific against all diseases produced by repletion

“as to learning government arts manufactures and the like” my master
confessed “he could find little or no resemblance between the yahoos
of that country and those in ours for he only meant to observe what
parity there was in our natures  he had heard indeed some curious
houyhnhnms observe that in most herds there was a sort of ruling
yahoo (as among us there is generally some leading or principal stag in
a park) who was always more deformed in body and mischievous in
disposition than any of the rest that this leader had usually a
favourite as like himself as he could get whose employment was to lick
his masters feet and posteriors and drive the female yahoos to his
kennel for which he was now and then rewarded with a piece of asss
flesh  this favourite is hated by the whole herd and therefore to
protect himself keeps always near the person of his leader  he usually
continues in office till a worse can be found but the very moment he is
discarded his successor at the head of all the yahoos in that
district young and old male and female come in a body and discharge
their excrements upon him from head to foot  but how far this might be
applicable to our courts and favourites and ministers of state my
master said i could best determine”

i durst make no return to this malicious insinuation which debased human
understanding below the sagacity of a common hound who has judgment
enough to distinguish and follow the cry of the ablest dog in the pack
without being ever mistaken

my master told me “there were some qualities remarkable in the yahoos
which he had not observed me to mention or at least very slightly in
the accounts i had given of humankind”  he said “those animals like
other brutes had their females in common but in this they differed
that the she yahoo would admit the males while she was pregnant and
that the hes would quarrel and fight with the females as fiercely as
with each other both which practices were such degrees of infamous
brutality as no other sensitive creature ever arrived at

“another thing he wondered at in the yahoos was their strange
disposition to nastiness and dirt whereas there appears to be a natural
love of cleanliness in all other animals”  as to the two former
accusations i was glad to let them pass without any reply because i had
not a word to offer upon them in defence of my species which otherwise i
certainly had done from my own inclinations  but i could have easily
vindicated humankind from the imputation of singularity upon the last
article if there had been any swine in that country (as unluckily for me
there were not) which although it may be a sweeter quadruped than a
yahoo cannot i humbly conceive in justice pretend to more
cleanliness and so his honour himself must have owned if he had seen
their filthy way of feeding and their custom of wallowing and sleeping
in the mud

my master likewise mentioned another quality which his servants had
discovered in several yahoos and to him was wholly unaccountable  he
said “a fancy would sometimes take a yahoo to retire into a corner to
lie down and howl and groan and spurn away all that came near him
although he were young and fat wanted neither food nor water nor did
the servant imagine what could possibly ail him  and the only remedy
they found was to set him to hard work after which he would infallibly
come to himself”  to this i was silent out of partiality to my own kind
yet here i could plainly discover the true seeds of spleen which only
seizes on the lazy the luxurious and the rich who if they were forced
to undergo the same regimen i would undertake for the cure

his honour had further observed “that a female yahoo would often stand
behind a bank or a bush to gaze on the young males passing by and then
appear and hide using many antic gestures and grimaces at which time
it was observed that she had a most offensive smell and when any of the
males advanced would slowly retire looking often back and with a
counterfeit show of fear run off into some convenient place where she
knew the male would follow her

“at other times if a female stranger came among them three or four of
her own sex would get about her and stare and chatter and grin and
smell her all over and then turn off with gestures that seemed to
express contempt and disdain”

perhaps my master might refine a little in these speculations which he
had drawn from what he observed himself or had been told him by others
however i could not reflect without some amazement and much sorrow
that the rudiments of lewdness coquetry censure and scandal should
have place by instinct in womankind

i expected every moment that my master would accuse the yahoos of those
unnatural appetites in both sexes so common among us  but nature it
seems has not been so expert a school-mistress and these politer
pleasures are entirely the productions of art and reason on our side of
the globe



chapter viii


the author relates several particulars of the yahoos  the great
virtues of the houyhnhnms  the education and exercise of their youth
their general assembly

as i ought to have understood human nature much better than i supposed it
possible for my master to do so it was easy to apply the character he
gave of the yahoos to myself and my countrymen and i believed i could
yet make further discoveries from my own observation  i therefore often
begged his honour to let me go among the herds of yahoos in the
neighbourhood to which he always very graciously consented being
perfectly convinced that the hatred i bore these brutes would never
suffer me to be corrupted by them and his honour ordered one of his
servants a strong sorrel nag very honest and good-natured to be my
guard without whose protection i durst not undertake such adventures
for i have already told the reader how much i was pestered by these
odious animals upon my first arrival and i afterwards failed very
narrowly three or four times of falling into their clutches when i
happened to stray at any distance without my hanger  and i have reason
to believe they had some imagination that i was of their own species
which i often assisted myself by stripping up my sleeves and showing my
naked arms and breasts in their sight when my protector was with me  at
which times they would approach as near as they durst and imitate my
actions after the manner of monkeys but ever with great signs of hatred
as a tame jackdaw with cap and stockings is always persecuted by the wild
ones when he happens to be got among them

they are prodigiously nimble from their infancy  however i once caught
a young male of three years old and endeavoured by all marks of
tenderness to make it quiet but the little imp fell a squalling and
scratching and biting with such violence that i was forced to let it
go and it was high time for a whole troop of old ones came about us at
the noise but finding the cub was safe (for away it ran) and my sorrel
nag being by they durst not venture near us  i observed the young
animals flesh to smell very rank and the stink was somewhat between a
weasel and a fox but much more disagreeable  i forgot another
circumstance (and perhaps i might have the readers pardon if it were
wholly omitted) that while i held the odious vermin in my hands it
voided its filthy excrements of a yellow liquid substance all over my
clothes but by good fortune there was a small brook hard by where i
washed myself as clean as i could although i durst not come into my
masters presence until i were sufficiently aired

by what i could discover the yahoos appear to be the most unteachable
of all animals their capacity never reaching higher than to draw or
carry burdens  yet i am of opinion this defect arises chiefly from a
perverse restive disposition for they are cunning malicious
treacherous and revengeful  they are strong and hardy but of a
cowardly spirit and by consequence insolent abject and cruel  it is
observed that the red haired of both sexes are more libidinous and
mischievous than the rest whom yet they much exceed in strength and
activity

the houyhnhnms keep the yahoos for present use in huts not far from
the house but the rest are sent abroad to certain fields where they dig
up roots eat several kinds of herbs and search about for carrion or
sometimes catch weasels and luhimuhs (a sort of wild rat) which they
greedily devour  nature has taught them to dig deep holes with their
nails on the side of a rising ground wherein they lie by themselves
only the kennels of the females are larger sufficient to hold two or
three cubs

they swim from their infancy like frogs and are able to continue long
under water where they often take fish which the females carry home to
their young  and upon this occasion i hope the reader will pardon my
relating an odd adventure

being one day abroad with my protector the sorrel nag and the weather
exceeding hot i entreated him to let me bathe in a river that was near
he consented and i immediately stripped myself stark naked and went
down softly into the stream  it happened that a young female yahoo
standing behind a bank saw the whole proceeding and inflamed by desire
as the nag and i conjectured came running with all speed and leaped
into the water within five yards of the place where i bathed  i was
never in my life so terribly frightened  the nag was grazing at some
distance not suspecting any harm  she embraced me after a most fulsome
manner  i roared as loud as i could and the nag came galloping towards
me whereupon she quitted her grasp with the utmost reluctancy and
leaped upon the opposite bank where she stood gazing and howling all the
time i was putting on my clothes

this was a matter of diversion to my master and his family as well as of
mortification to myself  for now i could no longer deny that i was a
real yahoo in every limb and feature since the females had a natural
propensity to me as one of their own species  neither was the hair of
this brute of a red colour (which might have been some excuse for an
appetite a little irregular) but black as a sloe and her countenance
did not make an appearance altogether so hideous as the rest of her kind
for i think she could not be above eleven years old

having lived three years in this country the reader i suppose will
expect that i should like other travellers give him some account of the
manners and customs of its inhabitants which it was indeed my principal
study to learn

as these noble houyhnhnms are endowed by nature with a general
disposition to all virtues and have no conceptions or ideas of what is
evil in a rational creature so their grand maxim is to cultivate
reason and to be wholly governed by it  neither is reason among them a
point problematical as with us where men can argue with plausibility on
both sides of the question but strikes you with immediate conviction as
it must needs do where it is not mingled obscured or discoloured by
passion and interest  i remember it was with extreme difficulty that i
could bring my master to understand the meaning of the word opinion or
how a point could be disputable because reason taught us to affirm or
deny only where we are certain and beyond our knowledge we cannot do
either  so that controversies wranglings disputes and positiveness
in false or dubious propositions are evils unknown among the
houyhnhnms  in the like manner when i used to explain to him our
several systems of natural philosophy he would laugh “that a creature
pretending to reason should value itself upon the knowledge of other
peoples conjectures and in things where that knowledge if it were
certain could be of no use”  wherein he agreed entirely with the
sentiments of socrates as plato delivers them which i mention as the
highest honour i can do that prince of philosophers  i have often since
reflected what destruction such doctrine would make in the libraries of
europe and how many paths of fame would be then shut up in the learned
world

friendship and benevolence are the two principal virtues among the
houyhnhnms and these not confined to particular objects but universal
to the whole race for a stranger from the remotest part is equally
treated with the nearest neighbour and wherever he goes looks upon
himself as at home  they preserve decency and civility in the highest
degrees but are altogether ignorant of ceremony  they have no fondness
for their colts or foals but the care they take in educating them
proceeds entirely from the dictates of reason  and i observed my master
to show the same affection to his neighbours issue that he had for his
own  they will have it that nature teaches them to love the whole
species and it is reason only that makes a distinction of persons where
there is a superior degree of virtue

when the matron houyhnhnms have produced one of each sex they no
longer accompany with their consorts except they lose one of their issue
by some casualty which very seldom happens but in such a case they meet
again or when the like accident befalls a person whose wife is past
bearing some other couple bestow on him one of their own colts and then
go together again until the mother is pregnant  this caution is
necessary to prevent the country from being overburdened with numbers
but the race of inferior houyhnhnms bred up to be servants is not so
strictly limited upon this article these are allowed to produce three of
each sex to be domestics in the noble families

in their marriages they are exactly careful to choose such colours as
will not make any disagreeable mixture in the breed  strength is chiefly
valued in the male and comeliness in the female not upon the account of
love but to preserve the race from degenerating for where a female
happens to excel in strength a consort is chosen with regard to
comeliness

courtship love presents jointures settlements have no place in their
thoughts or terms whereby to express them in their language  the young
couple meet and are joined merely because it is the determination of
their parents and friends it is what they see done every day and they
look upon it as one of the necessary actions of a reasonable being  but
the violation of marriage or any other unchastity was never heard of
and the married pair pass their lives with the same friendship and mutual
benevolence that they bear to all others of the same species who come in
their way without jealousy fondness quarrelling or discontent

in educating the youth of both sexes their method is admirable and
highly deserves our imitation  these are not suffered to taste a grain
of oats except upon certain days till eighteen years old nor milk but
very rarely and in summer they graze two hours in the morning and as
many in the evening which their parents likewise observe but the
servants are not allowed above half that time and a great part of their
grass is brought home which they eat at the most convenient hours when
they can be best spared from work

temperance industry exercise and cleanliness are the lessons equally
enjoined to the young ones of both sexes and my master thought it
monstrous in us to give the females a different kind of education from
the males except in some articles of domestic management whereby as he
truly observed one half of our natives were good for nothing but
bringing children into the world and to trust the care of our children
to such useless animals he said was yet a greater instance of
brutality

but the houyhnhnms train up their youth to strength speed and
hardiness by exercising them in running races up and down steep hills
and over hard stony grounds and when they are all in a sweat they are
ordered to leap over head and ears into a pond or river  four times a
year the youth of a certain district meet to show their proficiency in
running and leaping and other feats of strength and agility where the
victor is rewarded with a song in his or her praise  on this festival
the servants drive a herd of yahoos into the field laden with hay and
oats and milk for a repast to the houyhnhnms after which these
brutes are immediately driven back again for fear of being noisome to
the assembly

every fourth year at the vernal equinox there is a representative
council of the whole nation which meets in a plain about twenty miles
from our house and continues about five or six days  here they inquire
into the state and condition of the several districts whether they
abound or be deficient in hay or oats or cows or yahoos and wherever
there is any want (which is but seldom) it is immediately supplied by
unanimous consent and contribution  here likewise the regulation of
children is settled as for instance if a houyhnhnm has two males he
changes one of them with another that has two females and when a child
has been lost by any casualty where the mother is past breeding it is
determined what family in the district shall breed another to supply the
loss



chapter ix


a grand debate at the general assembly of the houyhnhnms and how it
was determined  the learning of the houyhnhnms  their buildings
their manner of burials  the defectiveness of their language

one of these grand assemblies was held in my time about three months
before my departure whither my master went as the representative of our
district  in this council was resumed their old debate and indeed the
only debate that ever happened in their country whereof my master after
his return give me a very particular account

the question to be debated was “whether the yahoos should be
exterminated from the face of the earth?”  one of the members for the
affirmative offered several arguments of great strength and weight
alleging “that as the yahoos were the most filthy noisome and
deformed animals which nature ever produced so they were the most
restive and indocible mischievous and malicious they would privately
suck the teats of the houyhnhnms cows kill and devour their cats
trample down their oats and grass if they were not continually watched
and commit a thousand other extravagancies”  he took notice of a general
tradition “that yahoos had not been always in their country but that
many ages ago two of these brutes appeared together upon a mountain
whether produced by the heat of the sun upon corrupted mud and slime or
from the ooze and froth of the sea was never known that these yahoos
engendered and their brood in a short time grew so numerous as to
overrun and infest the whole nation that the houyhnhnms to get rid of
this evil made a general hunting and at last enclosed the whole herd
and destroying the elder every houyhnhnm kept two young ones in a
kennel and brought them to such a degree of tameness as an animal so
savage by nature can be capable of acquiring using them for draught and
carriage that there seemed to be much truth in this tradition and that
those creatures could not be yinhniamshy (or aborigines of the land)
because of the violent hatred the houyhnhnms as well as all other
animals bore them which although their evil disposition sufficiently
deserved could never have arrived at so high a degree if they had been
aborigines or else they would have long since been rooted out that
the inhabitants taking a fancy to use the service of the yahoos had
very imprudently neglected to cultivate the breed of asses which are a
comely animal easily kept more tame and orderly without any offensive
smell strong enough for labour although they yield to the other in
agility of body and if their braying be no agreeable sound it is far
preferable to the horrible howlings of the yahoos”

several others declared their sentiments to the same purpose when my
master proposed an expedient to the assembly whereof he had indeed
borrowed the hint from me  “he approved of the tradition mentioned by
the honourable member who spoke before and affirmed that the two
yahoos said to be seen first among them had been driven thither over
the sea that coming to land and being forsaken by their companions
they retired to the mountains and degenerating by degrees became in
process of time much more savage than those of their own species in the
country whence these two originals came  the reason of this assertion
was that he had now in his possession a certain wonderful yahoo
(meaning myself) which most of them had heard of and many of them had
seen  he then related to them how he first found me that my body was
all covered with an artificial composure of the skins and hairs of other
animals that i spoke in a language of my own and had thoroughly learned
theirs that i had related to him the accidents which brought me thither
that when he saw me without my covering i was an exact yahoo in every
part only of a whiter colour less hairy and with shorter claws  he
added how i had endeavoured to persuade him that in my own and other
countries the yahoos acted as the governing rational animal and held
the houyhnhnms in servitude that he observed in me all the qualities
of a yahoo only a little more civilized by some tincture of reason
which however was in a degree as far inferior to the houyhnhnm race
as the yahoos of their country were to me that among other things i
mentioned a custom we had of castrating houyhnhnms when they were
young in order to render them tame that the operation was easy and
safe that it was no shame to learn wisdom from brutes as industry is
taught by the ant and building by the swallow (for so i translate the
word lyhannh although it be a much larger fowl) that this invention
might be practised upon the younger yahoos here which besides
rendering them tractable and fitter for use would in an age put an end
to the whole species without destroying life that in the mean time the
houyhnhnms should be exhorted to cultivate the breed of asses which
as they are in all respects more valuable brutes so they have this
advantage to be fit for service at five years old which the others are
not till twelve”

this was all my master thought fit to tell me at that time of what
passed in the grand council  but he was pleased to conceal one
particular which related personally to myself whereof i soon felt the
unhappy effect as the reader will know in its proper place and whence i
date all the succeeding misfortunes of my life

the houyhnhnms have no letters and consequently their knowledge is all
traditional  but there happening few events of any moment among a people
so well united naturally disposed to every virtue wholly governed by
reason and cut off from all commerce with other nations the historical
part is easily preserved without burdening their memories  i have
already observed that they are subject to no diseases and therefore can
have no need of physicians  however they have excellent medicines
composed of herbs to cure accidental bruises and cuts in the pastern or
frog of the foot by sharp stones as well as other maims and hurts in
the several parts of the body

they calculate the year by the revolution of the sun and moon but use no
subdivisions into weeks  they are well enough acquainted with the
motions of those two luminaries and understand the nature of eclipses
and this is the utmost progress of their astronomy

in poetry they must be allowed to excel all other mortals wherein the
justness of their similes and the minuteness as well as exactness of
their descriptions are indeed inimitable  their verses abound very much
in both of these and usually contain either some exalted notions of
friendship and benevolence or the praises of those who were victors in
races and other bodily exercises  their buildings although very rude
and simple are not inconvenient but well contrived to defend them from
all injuries of cold and heat  they have a kind of tree which at forty
years old loosens in the root and falls with the first storm it grows
very straight and being pointed like stakes with a sharp stone (for the
houyhnhnms know not the use of iron) they stick them erect in the
ground about ten inches asunder and then weave in oat straw or
sometimes wattles between them  the roof is made after the same manner
and so are the doors

the houyhnhnms use the hollow part between the pastern and the hoof of
their fore-foot as we do our hands and this with greater dexterity than
i could at first imagine  i have seen a white mare of our family thread
a needle (which i lent her on purpose) with that joint  they milk their
cows reap their oats and do all the work which requires hands in the
same manner  they have a kind of hard flints which by grinding against
other stones they form into instruments that serve instead of wedges
axes and hammers  with tools made of these flints they likewise cut
their hay and reap their oats which there grow naturally in several
fields the yahoos draw home the sheaves in carriages and the servants
tread them in certain covered huts to get out the grain which is kept in
stores  they make a rude kind of earthen and wooden vessels and bake
the former in the sun

if they can avoid casualties they die only of old age and are buried in
the obscurest places that can be found their friends and relations
expressing neither joy nor grief at their departure nor does the dying
person discover the least regret that he is leaving the world any more
than if he were upon returning home from a visit to one of his
neighbours  i remember my master having once made an appointment with a
friend and his family to come to his house upon some affair of
importance on the day fixed the mistress and her two children came very
late she made two excuses first for her husband who as she said
happened that very morning to shnuwnh  the word is strongly expressive
in their language but not easily rendered into english it signifies
“to retire to his first mother”  her excuse for not coming sooner was
that her husband dying late in the morning she was a good while
consulting her servants about a convenient place where his body should be
laid and i observed she behaved herself at our house as cheerfully as
the rest  she died about three months after

they live generally to seventy or seventy-five years very seldom to
fourscore  some weeks before their death they feel a gradual decay but
without pain  during this time they are much visited by their friends
because they cannot go abroad with their usual ease and satisfaction
however about ten days before their death which they seldom fail in
computing they return the visits that have been made them by those who
are nearest in the neighbourhood being carried in a convenient sledge
drawn by yahoos which vehicle they use not only upon this occasion
but when they grow old upon long journeys or when they are lamed by any
accident and therefore when the dying houyhnhnms return those visits
they take a solemn leave of their friends as if they were going to some
remote part of the country where they designed to pass the rest of their
lives

i know not whether it may be worth observing that the houyhnhnms have
no word in their language to express any thing that is evil except what
they borrow from the deformities or ill qualities of the yahoos  thus
they denote the folly of a servant an omission of a child a stone that
cuts their feet a continuance of foul or unseasonable weather and the
like by adding to each the epithet of yahoo  for instance hhnm
yahoo whnaholm yahoo ynlhmndwihlma yahoo and an ill-contrived
house ynholmhnmrohlnw yahoo

i could with great pleasure enlarge further upon the manners and
virtues of this excellent people but intending in a short time to
publish a volume by itself expressly upon that subject i refer the
reader thither and in the mean time proceed to relate my own sad
catastrophe



chapter x


the authors economy and happy life among the houyhnhnms  his great
improvement in virtue by conversing with them  their conversations  the
author has notice given him by his master that he must depart from the
country  he falls into a swoon for grief but submits  he contrives and
finishes a canoe by the help of a fellow-servant and puts to sea at a
venture

i had settled my little economy to my own hearts content  my master had
ordered a room to be made for me after their manner about six yards
from the house the sides and floors of which i plastered with clay and
covered with rush-mats of my own contriving  i had beaten hemp which
there grows wild and made of it a sort of ticking this i filled with
the feathers of several birds i had taken with springes made of yahoos
hairs and were excellent food  i had worked two chairs with my knife
the sorrel nag helping me in the grosser and more laborious part  when
my clothes were worn to rags i made myself others with the skins of
rabbits and of a certain beautiful animal about the same size called
nnuhnoh the skin of which is covered with a fine down  of these i
also made very tolerable stockings  i soled my shoes with wood which i
cut from a tree and fitted to the upper-leather and when this was worn
out i supplied it with the skins of yahoos dried in the sun  i often
got honey out of hollow trees which i mingled with water or ate with my
bread  no man could more verify the truth of these two maxims “that
nature is very easily satisfied” and “that necessity is the mother of
invention”  i enjoyed perfect health of body and tranquillity of mind
i did not feel the treachery or inconstancy of a friend nor the injuries
of a secret or open enemy  i had no occasion of bribing flattering or
pimping to procure the favour of any great man or of his minion i
wanted no fence against fraud or oppression here was neither physician
to destroy my body nor lawyer to ruin my fortune no informer to watch
my words and actions or forge accusations against me for hire here were
no gibers censurers backbiters pickpockets highwaymen housebreakers
attorneys bawds buffoons gamesters politicians wits splenetics
tedious talkers controvertists ravishers murderers robbers
virtuosos no leaders or followers of party and faction no encouragers
to vice by seducement or examples no dungeon axes gibbets
whipping-posts or pillories no cheating shopkeepers or mechanics no
pride vanity or affectation no fops bullies drunkards strolling
whores or poxes no ranting lewd expensive wives no stupid proud
pedants no importunate overbearing quarrelsome noisy roaring empty
conceited swearing companions no scoundrels raised from the dust upon
the merit of their vices or nobility thrown into it on account of their
virtues no lords fiddlers judges or dancing-masters

i had the favour of being admitted to several houyhnhnms who came to
visit or dine with my master where his honour graciously suffered me to
wait in the room and listen to their discourse  both he and his company
would often descend to ask me questions and receive my answers  i had
also sometimes the honour of attending my master in his visits to others
i never presumed to speak except in answer to a question and then i did
it with inward regret because it was a loss of so much time for
improving myself but i was infinitely delighted with the station of an
humble auditor in such conversations where nothing passed but what was
useful expressed in the fewest and most significant words where as i
have already said the greatest decency was observed without the least
degree of ceremony where no person spoke without being pleased himself
and pleasing his companions where there was no interruption
tediousness heat or difference of sentiments  they have a notion that
when people are met together a short silence does much improve
conversation this i found to be true for during those little
intermissions of talk new ideas would arise in their minds which very
much enlivened the discourse  their subjects are generally on
friendship and benevolence on order and economy sometimes upon the
visible operations of nature or ancient traditions upon the bounds and
limits of virtue upon the unerring rules of reason or upon some
determinations to be taken at the next great assembly and often upon the
various excellences of poetry  i may add without vanity that my
presence often gave them sufficient matter for discourse because it
afforded my master an occasion of letting his friends into the history of
me and my country upon which they were all pleased to descant in a
manner not very advantageous to humankind and for that reason i shall
not repeat what they said only i may be allowed to observe that his
honour to my great admiration appeared to understand the nature of
yahoos much better than myself  he went through all our vices and
follies and discovered many which i had never mentioned to him by only
supposing what qualities a yahoo of their country with a small
proportion of reason might be capable of exerting and concluded with
too much probability “how vile as well as miserable such a creature
must be”

i freely confess that all the little knowledge i have of any value was
acquired by the lectures i received from my master and from hearing the
discourses of him and his friends to which i should be prouder to
listen than to dictate to the greatest and wisest assembly in europe  i
admired the strength comeliness and speed of the inhabitants and such
a constellation of virtues in such amiable persons produced in me the
highest veneration  at first indeed i did not feel that natural awe
which the yahoos and all other animals bear toward them but it grew
upon me by decrees much sooner than i imagined and was mingled with a
respectful love and gratitude that they would condescend to distinguish
me from the rest of my species

when i thought of my family my friends my countrymen or the human race
in general i considered them as they really were yahoos in shape and
disposition perhaps a little more civilized and qualified with the gift
of speech but making no other use of reason than to improve and
multiply those vices whereof their brethren in this country had only the
share that nature allotted them  when i happened to behold the
reflection of my own form in a lake or fountain i turned away my face in
horror and detestation of myself and could better endure the sight of a
common yahoo than of my own person  by conversing with the
houyhnhnms and looking upon them with delight i fell to imitate their
gait and gesture which is now grown into a habit and my friends often
tell me in a blunt way “that i trot like a horse” which however i
take for a great compliment  neither shall i disown that in speaking i
am apt to fall into the voice and manner of the houyhnhnms and hear
myself ridiculed on that account without the least mortification

in the midst of all this happiness and when i looked upon myself to be
fully settled for life my master sent for me one morning a little
earlier than his usual hour  i observed by his countenance that he was
in some perplexity and at a loss how to begin what he had to speak
after a short silence he told me “he did not know how i would take what
he was going to say that in the last general assembly when the affair
of the yahoos was entered upon the representatives had taken offence
at his keeping a yahoo (meaning myself) in his family more like a
houyhnhnm than a brute animal that he was known frequently to converse
with me as if he could receive some advantage or pleasure in my company
that such a practice was not agreeable to reason or nature or a thing
ever heard of before among them the assembly did therefore exhort him
either to employ me like the rest of my species or command me to swim
back to the place whence i came that the first of these expedients was
utterly rejected by all the houyhnhnms who had ever seen me at his
house or their own for they alleged that because i had some rudiments
of reason added to the natural pravity of those animals it was to be
feared i might be able to seduce them into the woody and mountainous
parts of the country and bring them in troops by night to destroy the
houyhnhnms cattle as being naturally of the ravenous kind and averse
from labour”

my master added “that he was daily pressed by the houyhnhnms of the
neighbourhood to have the assemblys exhortation executed which he could
not put off much longer  he doubted it would be impossible for me to
swim to another country and therefore wished i would contrive some sort
of vehicle resembling those i had described to him that might carry me
on the sea in which work i should have the assistance of his own
servants as well as those of his neighbours”  he concluded “that for
his own part he could have been content to keep me in his service as
long as i lived because he found i had cured myself of some bad habits
and dispositions by endeavouring as far as my inferior nature was
capable to imitate the houyhnhnms”

i should here observe to the reader that a decree of the general
assembly in this country is expressed by the word hnhloayn which
signifies an exhortation as near as i can render it for they have no
conception how a rational creature can be compelled but only advised or
exhorted because no person can disobey reason without giving up his
claim to be a rational creature

i was struck with the utmost grief and despair at my masters discourse
and being unable to support the agonies i was under i fell into a swoon
at his feet  when i came to myself he told me “that he concluded i had
been dead” for these people are subject to no such imbecilities of
nature  i answered in a faint voice “that death would have been too
great a happiness that although i could not blame the assemblys
exhortation or the urgency of his friends yet in my weak and corrupt
judgment i thought it might consist with reason to have been less
rigorous that i could not swim a league and probably the nearest land
to theirs might be distant above a hundred that many materials
necessary for making a small vessel to carry me off were wholly wanting
in this country which however i would attempt in obedience and
gratitude to his honour although i concluded the thing to be impossible
and therefore looked on myself as already devoted to destruction that
the certain prospect of an unnatural death was the least of my evils
for supposing i should escape with life by some strange adventure how
could i think with temper of passing my days among yahoos and
relapsing into my old corruptions for want of examples to lead and keep
me within the paths of virtue? that i knew too well upon what solid
reasons all the determinations of the wise houyhnhnms were founded not
to be shaken by arguments of mine a miserable yahoo and therefore
after presenting him with my humble thanks for the offer of his servants
assistance in making a vessel and desiring a reasonable time for so
difficult a work i told him i would endeavour to preserve a wretched
being and if ever i returned to england was not without hopes of being
useful to my own species by celebrating the praises of the renowned
houyhnhnms and proposing their virtues to the imitation of mankind”

my master in a few words made me a very gracious reply allowed me the
space of two months to finish my boat and ordered the sorrel nag my
fellow-servant (for so at this distance i may presume to call him) to
follow my instruction because i told my master “that his help would be
sufficient and i knew he had a tenderness for me”

in his company my first business was to go to that part of the coast
where my rebellious crew had ordered me to be set on shore  i got upon a
height and looking on every side into the sea fancied i saw a small
island toward the north-east  i took out my pocket glass and could then
clearly distinguish it above five leagues off as i computed but it
appeared to the sorrel nag to be only a blue cloud for as he had no
conception of any country beside his own so he could not be as expert in
distinguishing remote objects at sea as we who so much converse in that
element

after i had discovered this island i considered no further but resolved
it should if possible be the first place of my banishment leaving the
consequence to fortune

i returned home and consulting with the sorrel nag we went into a copse
at some distance where i with my knife and he with a sharp flint
fastened very artificially after their manner to a wooden handle cut
down several oak wattles about the thickness of a walking-staff and
some larger pieces  but i shall not trouble the reader with a particular
description of my own mechanics let it suffice to say that in six weeks
time with the help of the sorrel nag who performed the parts that
required most labour i finished a sort of indian canoe but much larger
covering it with the skins of yahoos well stitched together with
hempen threads of my own making  my sail was likewise composed of the
skins of the same animal but i made use of the youngest i could get the
older being too tough and thick and i likewise provided myself with four
paddles  i laid in a stock of boiled flesh of rabbits and fowls and
took with me two vessels one filled with milk and the other with water

i tried my canoe in a large pond near my masters house and then
corrected in it what was amiss stopping all the chinks with yahoos
tallow till i found it staunch and able to bear me and my freight and
when it was as complete as i could possibly make it i had it drawn on a
carriage very gently by yahoos to the sea-side under the conduct of
the sorrel nag and another servant

when all was ready and the day came for my departure i took leave of my
master and lady and the whole family my eyes flowing with tears and my
heart quite sunk with grief  but his honour out of curiosity and
perhaps (if i may speak without vanity) partly out of kindness was
determined to see me in my canoe and got several of his neighbouring
friends to accompany him  i was forced to wait above an hour for the
tide and then observing the wind very fortunately bearing toward the
island to which i intended to steer my course i took a second leave of
my master but as i was going to prostrate myself to kiss his hoof he
did me the honour to raise it gently to my mouth  i am not ignorant how
much i have been censured for mentioning this last particular
detractors are pleased to think it improbable that so illustrious a
person should descend to give so great a mark of distinction to a
creature so inferior as i  neither have i forgotten how apt some
travellers are to boast of extraordinary favours they have received
but if these censurers were better acquainted with the noble and
courteous disposition of the houyhnhnms they would soon change their
opinion

i paid my respects to the rest of the houyhnhnms in his honours
company then getting into my canoe i pushed off from shore

settle there  is wounded with an arrow by one of the natives  is seized
and carried by force into a portuguese ship  the great civilities of the
captain  the author arrives at england

i began this desperate voyage on february 15 1714–15 at nine oclock in
the morning  the wind was very favourable however i made use at first
only of my paddles but considering i should soon be weary and that the
wind might chop about i ventured to set up my little sail and thus
with the help of the tide i went at the rate of a league and a half an
hour as near as i could guess  my master and his friends continued on
the shore till i was almost out of sight and i often heard the sorrel
nag (who always loved me) crying out “hnuy illa nyha majah yahoo”
“take care of thyself gentle yahoo”

my design was if possible to discover some small island uninhabited
yet sufficient by my labour to furnish me with the necessaries of life
which i would have thought a greater happiness than to be first minister
in the politest court of europe so horrible was the idea i conceived of
returning to live in the society and under the government of yahoos
for in such a solitude as i desired i could at least enjoy my own
thoughts and reflect with delight on the virtues of those inimitable
houyhnhnms without an opportunity of degenerating into the vices and
corruptions of my own species

the reader may remember what i related when my crew conspired against
me and confined me to my cabin how i continued there several weeks
without knowing what course we took and when i was put ashore in the
long-boat how the sailors told me with oaths whether true or false
“that they knew not in what part of the world we were”  however i did
then believe us to be about 10 degrees southward of the cape of good
hope or about 45 degrees southern latitude as i gathered from some
general words i overheard among them being i supposed to the south-east
in their intended voyage to madagascar  and although this were little
better than conjecture yet i resolved to steer my course eastward
hoping to reach the south-west coast of new holland and perhaps some
such island as i desired lying westward of it  the wind was full west
and by six in the evening i computed i had gone eastward at least
eighteen leagues when i spied a very small island about half a league
off which i soon reached  it was nothing but a rock with one creek
naturally arched by the force of tempests  here i put in my canoe and
climbing a part of the rock i could plainly discover land to the east
extending from south to north  i lay all night in my canoe and
repeating my voyage early in the morning i arrived in seven hours to the
south-east point of new holland  this confirmed me in the opinion i have
long entertained that the maps and charts place this country at least
three degrees more to the east than it really is which thought i
communicated many years ago to my worthy friend mr herman moll and
gave him my reasons for it although he has rather chosen to follow other
authors

i saw no inhabitants in the place where i landed and being unarmed i
was afraid of venturing far into the country  i found some shellfish on
the shore and ate them raw not daring to kindle a fire for fear of
being discovered by the natives  i continued three days feeding on
oysters and limpets to save my own provisions and i fortunately found a
brook of excellent water which gave me great relief

on the fourth day venturing out early a little too far i saw twenty or
thirty natives upon a height not above five hundred yards from me  they
were stark naked men women and children round a fire as i could
discover by the smoke  one of them spied me and gave notice to the
rest five of them advanced toward me leaving the women and children at
the fire  i made what haste i could to the shore and getting into my
canoe shoved off the savages observing me retreat ran after me and
before i could get far enough into the sea discharged an arrow which
wounded me deeply on the inside of my left knee i shall carry the mark
to my grave  i apprehended the arrow might be poisoned and paddling out
of the reach of their darts (being a calm day) i made a shift to suck
the wound and dress it as well as i could

i was at a loss what to do for i durst not return to the same
landing-place but stood to the north and was forced to paddle for the
wind though very gentle was against me blowing north-west  as i was
looking about for a secure landing-place i saw a sail to the
north-north-east which appearing every minute more visible i was in
some doubt whether i should wait for them or not but at last my
detestation of the yahoo race prevailed and turning my canoe i sailed
and paddled together to the south and got into the same creek whence i
set out in the morning choosing rather to trust myself among these
barbarians than live with european yahoos  i drew up my canoe as
close as i could to the shore and hid myself behind a stone by the
little brook which as i have already said was excellent water

the ship came within half a league of this creek and sent her long boat
with vessels to take in fresh water (for the place it seems was very
well known) but i did not observe it till the boat was almost on shore
and it was too late to seek another hiding-place  the seamen at their
landing observed my canoe and rummaging it all over easily conjectured
that the owner could not be far off  four of them well armed searched
every cranny and lurking-hole till at last they found me flat on my face
behind the stone  they gazed awhile in admiration at my strange uncouth
dress my coat made of skins my wooden-soled shoes and my furred
stockings whence however they concluded i was not a native of the
place who all go naked  one of the seamen in portuguese bid me rise
and asked who i was  i understood that language very well and getting
upon my feet said “i was a poor yahoo banished from the houyhnhnms
and desired they would please to let me depart”  they admired to hear me
answer them in their own tongue and saw by my complexion i must be a
european but were at a loss to know what i meant by yahoos and
houyhnhnms and at the same time fell a-laughing at my strange tone in
speaking which resembled the neighing of a horse  i trembled all the
while betwixt fear and hatred  i again desired leave to depart and was
gently moving to my canoe but they laid hold of me desiring to know
“what country i was of? whence i came?” with many other questions  i
told them “i was born in england whence i came about five years ago and
then their country and ours were at peace  i therefore hoped they would
not treat me as an enemy since i meant them no harm but was a poor
yahoo seeking some desolate place where to pass the remainder of his
unfortunate life”

when they began to talk i thought i never heard or saw any thing more
unnatural for it appeared to me as monstrous as if a dog or a cow should
speak in england or a yahoo in houyhnhnmland  the honest portuguese
were equally amazed at my strange dress and the odd manner of delivering
my words which however they understood very well  they spoke to me
with great humanity and said “they were sure the captain would carry me
gratis to lisbon whence i might return to my own country that two of
the seamen would go back to the ship inform the captain of what they had
seen and receive his orders in the mean time unless i would give my
solemn oath not to fly they would secure me by force”  i thought it
best to comply with their proposal  they were very curious to know my
story but i gave them very little satisfaction and they all conjectured
that my misfortunes had impaired my reason  in two hours the boat which
went laden with vessels of water returned with the captains command to
fetch me on board  i fell on my knees to preserve my liberty but all
was in vain and the men having tied me with cords heaved me into the
boat whence i was taken into the ship and thence into the captains
cabin

his name was pedro de mendez he was a very courteous and generous
person  he entreated me to give some account of myself and desired to
know what i would eat or drink said “i should be used as well as
himself” and spoke so many obliging things that i wondered to find such
civilities from a yahoo  however i remained silent and sullen i was
ready to faint at the very smell of him and his men  at last i desired
something to eat out of my own canoe but he ordered me a chicken and
some excellent wine and then directed that i should be put to bed in a
very clean cabin  i would not undress myself but lay on the
bed-clothes and in half an hour stole out when i thought the crew was
at dinner and getting to the side of the ship was going to leap into
the sea and swim for my life rather than continue among yahoos  but
one of the seamen prevented me and having informed the captain i was
chained to my cabin

after dinner don pedro came to me and desired to know my reason for so
desperate an attempt assured me “he only meant to do me all the service
he was able” and spoke so very movingly that at last i descended to
treat him like an animal which had some little portion of reason  i gave
him a very short relation of my voyage of the conspiracy against me by
my own men of the country where they set me on shore and of my five
years residence there  all which he looked upon as if it were a dream or
a vision whereat i took great offence for i had quite forgot the
faculty of lying so peculiar to yahoos in all countries where they
preside and consequently their disposition of suspecting truth in
others of their own species  i asked him “whether it were the custom in
his country to say the thing which was not?”  i assured him “i had
almost forgot what he meant by falsehood and if i had lived a thousand
years in houyhnhnmland i should never have heard a lie from the
meanest servant that i was altogether indifferent whether he believed me
or not but however in return for his favours i would give so much
allowance to the corruption of his nature as to answer any objection he
would please to make and then he might easily discover the truth”

the captain a wise man after many endeavours to catch me tripping in
some part of my story at last began to have a better opinion of my
veracity  but he added “that since i professed so inviolable an
attachment to truth i must give him my word and honour to bear him
company in this voyage without attempting any thing against my life or
else he would continue me a prisoner till we arrived at lisbon”  i gave
him the promise he required but at the same time protested “that i
would suffer the greatest hardships rather than return to live among
yahoos”

our voyage passed without any considerable accident  in gratitude to the
captain i sometimes sat with him at his earnest request and strove to
conceal my antipathy against human kind although it often broke out
which he suffered to pass without observation  but the greatest part of
the day i confined myself to my cabin to avoid seeing any of the crew
the captain had often entreated me to strip myself of my savage dress
and offered to lend me the best suit of clothes he had  this i would not
be prevailed on to accept abhorring to cover myself with any thing that
had been on the back of a yahoo  i only desired he would lend me two
clean shirts which having been washed since he wore them i believed
would not so much defile me  these i changed every second day and
washed them myself

we arrived at lisbon nov 5 1715  at our landing the captain forced
me to cover myself with his cloak to prevent the rabble from crowding
about me  i was conveyed to his own house and at my earnest request he
led me up to the highest room backwards  i conjured him “to conceal from
all persons what i had told him of the houyhnhnms because the least
hint of such a story would not only draw numbers of people to see me but
probably put me in danger of being imprisoned or burnt by the
inquisition”  the captain persuaded me to accept a suit of clothes newly
made but i would not suffer the tailor to take my measure however don
pedro being almost of my size they fitted me well enough  he accoutred
me with other necessaries all new which i aired for twenty-four hours
before i would use them

the captain had no wife nor above three servants none of which were
suffered to attend at meals and his whole deportment was so obliging
added to very good human understanding that i really began to tolerate
his company  he gained so far upon me that i ventured to look out of
the back window  by degrees i was brought into another room whence i
peeped into the street but drew my head back in a fright  in a weeks
time he seduced me down to the door  i found my terror gradually
lessened but my hatred and contempt seemed to increase  i was at last
bold enough to walk the street in his company but kept my nose well
stopped with rue or sometimes with tobacco

in ten days don pedro to whom i had given some account of my domestic
affairs put it upon me as a matter of honour and conscience “that i
ought to return to my native country and live at home with my wife and
children”  he told me “there was an english ship in the port just ready
to sail and he would furnish me with all things necessary”  it would be
tedious to repeat his arguments and my contradictions  he said “it was
altogether impossible to find such a solitary island as i desired to live
in but i might command in my own house and pass my time in a manner as
recluse as i pleased”

i complied at last finding i could not do better  i left lisbon the
24th day of november in an english merchantman but who was the master i
never inquired  don pedro accompanied me to the ship and lent me twenty
pounds  he took kind leave of me and embraced me at parting which i
bore as well as i could  during this last voyage i had no commerce with
the master or any of his men but pretending i was sick kept close in
my cabin  on the fifth of december 1715 we cast anchor in the downs
about nine in the morning and at three in the afternoon i got safe to my
house at rotherhith {546}

my wife and family received me with great surprise and joy because they
concluded me certainly dead but i must freely confess the sight of them
filled me only with hatred disgust and contempt and the more by
reflecting on the near alliance i had to them  for although since my
unfortunate exile from the houyhnhnm country i had compelled myself to
tolerate the sight of yahoos and to converse with don pedro de mendez
yet my memory and imagination were perpetually filled with the virtues
and ideas of those exalted houyhnhnms  and when i began to consider
that by copulating with one of the yahoo species i had become a parent
of more it struck me with the utmost shame confusion and horror

as soon as i entered the house my wife took me in her arms and kissed
me at which having not been used to the touch of that odious animal for
so many years i fell into a swoon for almost an hour  at the time i am
writing it is five years since my last return to england  during the
first year i could not endure my wife or children in my presence the
very smell of them was intolerable much less could i suffer them to eat
in the same room  to this hour they dare not presume to touch my bread
or drink out of the same cup neither was i ever able to let one of them
take me by the hand  the first money i laid out was to buy two young
stone-horses which i keep in a good stable and next to them the groom
is my greatest favourite for i feel my spirits revived by the smell he
contracts in the stable  my horses understand me tolerably well i
converse with them at least four hours every day  they are strangers to
bridle or saddle they live in great amity with me and friendship to each
other



chapter xii


the authors veracity  his design in publishing this work  his censure
of those travellers who swerve from the truth  the author clears himself
from any sinister ends in writing  an objection answered  the method of
planting colonies  his native country commended  the right of the crown
to those countries described by the author is justified  the difficulty
of conquering them  the author takes his last leave of the reader
proposes his manner of living for the future gives good advice and
concludes

thus gentle reader i have given thee a faithful history of my travels
for sixteen years and above seven months wherein i have not been so
studious of ornament as of truth  i could perhaps like others have
astonished thee with strange improbable tales but i rather chose to
relate plain matter of fact in the simplest manner and style because my
principal design was to inform and not to amuse thee

it is easy for us who travel into remote countries which are seldom
visited by englishmen or other europeans to form descriptions of
wonderful animals both at sea and land  whereas a travellers chief aim
should be to make men wiser and better and to improve their minds by the
bad as well as good example of what they deliver concerning foreign
places

i could heartily wish a law was enacted that every traveller before he
were permitted to publish his voyages should be obliged to make oath
before the lord high chancellor that all he intended to print was
absolutely true to the best of his knowledge for then the world would no
longer be deceived as it usually is while some writers to make their
works pass the better upon the public impose the grossest falsities on
the unwary reader  i have perused several books of travels with great
delight in my younger days but having since gone over most parts of the
globe and been able to contradict many fabulous accounts from my own
observation it has given me a great disgust against this part of
reading and some indignation to see the credulity of mankind so
impudently abused  therefore since my acquaintance were pleased to
think my poor endeavours might not be unacceptable to my country i
imposed on myself as a maxim never to be swerved from that i would
strictly adhere to truth neither indeed can i be ever under the least
temptation to vary from it while i retain in my mind the lectures and
example of my noble master and the other illustrious houyhnhnms of whom
i had so long the honour to be an humble hearer

    —nec si miserum fortuna sinonem
    finxit vanum etiam mendacemque improba finget

i know very well how little reputation is to be got by writings which
require neither genius nor learning nor indeed any other talent except
a good memory or an exact journal  i know likewise that writers of
travels like dictionary-makers are sunk into oblivion by the weight and
bulk of those who come last and therefore lie uppermost  and it is
highly probable that such travellers who shall hereafter visit the
countries described in this work of mine may by detecting my errors (if
there be any) and adding many new discoveries of their own justle me
out of vogue and stand in my place making the world forget that ever i
was an author  this indeed would be too great a mortification if i
wrote for fame but as my sole intention was the public good i cannot be
altogether disappointed  for who can read of the virtues i have
mentioned in the glorious houyhnhnms without being ashamed of his own
vices when he considers himself as the reasoning governing animal of
his country?  i shall say nothing of those remote nations where yahoos
preside among which the least corrupted are the brobdingnagians whose
wise maxims in morality and government it would be our happiness to
observe  but i forbear descanting further and rather leave the
judicious reader to his own remarks and application

i am not a little pleased that this work of mine can possibly meet with
no censurers for what objections can be made against a writer who
relates only plain facts that happened in such distant countries where
we have not the least interest with respect either to trade or
negotiations?  i have carefully avoided every fault with which common
writers of travels are often too justly charged  besides i meddle not
the least with any party but write without passion prejudice or
ill-will against any man or number of men whatsoever  i write for the
noblest end to inform and instruct mankind over whom i may without
breach of modesty pretend to some superiority from the advantages i
received by conversing so long among the most accomplished houyhnhnms
i write without any view to profit or praise  i never suffer a word to
pass that may look like reflection or possibly give the least offence
even to those who are most ready to take it  so that i hope i may with
justice pronounce myself an author perfectly blameless against whom the
tribes of answerers considerers observers reflectors detectors
remarkers will never be able to find matter for exercising their
talents

i confess it was whispered to me “that i was bound in duty as a
subject of england to have given in a memorial to a secretary of state
at my first coming over because whatever lands are discovered by a
subject belong to the crown”  but i doubt whether our conquests in the
countries i treat of would be as easy as those of ferdinando cortez over
the naked americans  the lilliputians i think are hardly worth the
charge of a fleet and army to reduce them and i question whether it
might be prudent or safe to attempt the brobdingnagians or whether an
english army would be much at their ease with the flying island over
their heads  the houyhnhnms indeed appear not to be so well prepared
for war a science to which they are perfect strangers and especially
against missive weapons  however supposing myself to be a minister of
state i could never give my advice for invading them  their prudence
unanimity unacquaintedness with fear and their love of their country
would amply supply all defects in the military art  imagine twenty
thousand of them breaking into the midst of an european army confounding
the ranks overturning the carriages battering the warriors faces into
mummy by terrible yerks from their hinder hoofs for they would well
deserve the character given to augustus recalcitrat undique tutus
but instead of proposals for conquering that magnanimous nation i
rather wish they were in a capacity or disposition to send a sufficient
number of their inhabitants for civilizing europe by teaching us the
first principles of honour justice truth temperance public spirit
fortitude chastity friendship benevolence and fidelity  the names of
all which virtues are still retained among us in most languages and are
to be met with in modern as well as ancient authors which i am able to
assert from my own small reading

but i had another reason which made me less forward to enlarge his
majestys dominions by my discoveries  to say the truth i had conceived
a few scruples with relation to the distributive justice of princes upon
those occasions  for instance a crew of pirates are driven by a storm
they know not whither at length a boy discovers land from the top-mast
they go on shore to rob and plunder they see a harmless people are
entertained with kindness they give the country a new name they take
formal possession of it for their king they set up a rotten plank or a
stone for a memorial they murder two or three dozen of the natives
bring away a couple more by force for a sample return home and get
their pardon  here commences a new dominion acquired with a title by
divine right  ships are sent with the first opportunity the natives
driven out or destroyed their princes tortured to discover their gold a
free license given to all acts of inhumanity and lust the earth reeking
with the blood of its inhabitants and this execrable crew of butchers
employed in so pious an expedition is a modern colony sent to convert
and civilize an idolatrous and barbarous people

but this description i confess does by no means affect the british
nation who may be an example to the whole world for their wisdom care
and justice in planting colonies their liberal endowments for the
advancement of religion and learning their choice of devout and able
pastors to propagate christianity their caution in stocking their
provinces with people of sober lives and conversations from this the
mother kingdom their strict regard to the distribution of justice in
supplying the civil administration through all their colonies with
officers of the greatest abilities utter strangers to corruption and
to crown all by sending the most vigilant and virtuous governors who
have no other views than the happiness of the people over whom they
preside and the honour of the king their master

but as those countries which i have described do not appear to have any
desire of being conquered and enslaved murdered or driven out by
colonies nor abound either in gold silver sugar or tobacco i did
humbly conceive they were by no means proper objects of our zeal our
valour or our interest  however if those whom it more concerns think
fit to be of another opinion i am ready to depose when i shall be
lawfully called that no european did ever visit those countries before
me  i mean if the inhabitants ought to be believed unless a dispute
may arise concerning the two yahoos said to have been seen many years
ago upon a mountain in houyhnhnmland

but as to the formality of taking possession in my sovereigns name it
never came once into my thoughts and if it had yet as my affairs then
stood i should perhaps in point of prudence and self-preservation have
put it off to a better opportunity

having thus answered the only objection that can ever be raised against
me as a traveller i here take a final leave of all my courteous readers
and return to enjoy my own speculations in my little garden at redriff
to apply those excellent lessons of virtue which i learned among the
houyhnhnms to instruct the yahoos of my own family is far as i
shall find them docible animals to behold my figure often in a glass
and thus if possible habituate myself by time to tolerate the sight of
a human creature to lament the brutality to houyhnhnms in my own
country but always treat their persons with respect for the sake of my
noble master his family his friends and the whole houyhnhnm race
whom these of ours have the honour to resemble in all their lineaments
however their intellectuals came to degenerate

i began last week to permit my wife to sit at dinner with me at the
farthest end of a long table and to answer (but with the utmost brevity)
the few questions i asked her  yet the smell of a yahoo continuing
very offensive i always keep my nose well stopped with rue lavender or
tobacco leaves  and although it be hard for a man late in life to
remove old habits i am not altogether out of hopes in some time to
suffer a neighbour yahoo in my company without the apprehensions i am
yet under of his teeth or his claws

my reconcilement to the yahoo kind in general might not be so
difficult if they would be content with those vices and follies only
which nature has entitled them to  i am not in the least provoked at the
sight of a lawyer a pickpocket a colonel a fool a lord a gamester a
politician a whoremonger a physician an evidence a suborner an
attorney a traitor or the like this is all according to the due course
of things but when i behold a lump of deformity and diseases both in
body and mind smitten with pride it immediately breaks all the measures
of my patience neither shall i be ever able to comprehend how such an
animal and such a vice could tally together  the wise and virtuous
houyhnhnms who abound in all excellences that can adorn a rational
creature have no name for this vice in their language which has no
terms to express any thing that is evil except those whereby they
describe the detestable qualities of their yahoos among which they
were not able to distinguish this of pride for want of thoroughly
understanding human nature as it shows itself in other countries where
that animal presides  but i who had more experience could plainly
observe some rudiments of it among the wild yahoos

but the houyhnhnms who live under the government of reason are no
more proud of the good qualities they possess than i should be for not
wanting a leg or an arm which no man in his wits would boast of
although he must be miserable without them  i dwell the longer upon this
subject from the desire i have to make the society of an english yahoo
by any means not insupportable and therefore i here entreat those who
have any tincture of this absurd vice that they will not presume to come

i wild wool


moral improvers have calls to preach i have a friend who has a call to
plough and woe to the daisy sod or azalea thicket that falls under
the savage redemption of his keen steel shares not content with the
so-called subjugation of every terrestrial bog rock and moorland he
would fain discover some method of reclamation applicable to the ocean
and the sky that in due calendar time they might be brought to bud and
blossom as the rose our efforts are of no avail when we seek to turn
his attention to wild roses or to the fact that both ocean and sky are
already about as rosy as possible the one with stars the other with
dulse and foam and wild light the practical developments of his
culture are orchards and clover-fields wearing a smiling benevolent
aspect truly excellent in their way though a near view discloses
something barbarous in them all wildness charms not my friend charm it
never so wisely and whatsoever may be the character of his heaven
his earth seems only a chaos of agricultural possibilities calling for
grubbing-hoes and manures

sometimes i venture to approach him with a plea for wildness when he
good-naturedly shakes a big mellow apple in my face reiterating his
favorite aphorism "culture is an orchard apple nature is a crab" not
all culture however is equally destructive and inappreciative azure
skies and crystal waters find loving recognition and few there be who
would welcome the axe among mountain pines or would care to apply
any correction to the tones and costumes of mountain waterfalls
nevertheless the barbarous notion is almost universally entertained by
civilized man that there is in all the manufactures of nature something
essentially coarse which can and must be eradicated by human culture
i was therefore delighted in finding that the wild wool growing upon
mountain sheep in the neighborhood of mount shasta was much finer than
the average grades of cultivated wool this fine discovery was made
some three months ago [1] while hunting among the shasta sheep between
shasta and lower klamath lake three fleeces were obtained one that
belonged to a large ram about four years old another to a ewe about the
same age and another to a yearling lamb after parting their beautiful
wool on the side and many places along the back shoulders and hips
and examining it closely with my lens i shouted "well done for
wildness wild wool is finer than tame"

my companions stooped down and examined the fleeces for themselves
pulling out tufts and ringlets spinning them between their fingers
and measuring the length of the staple each in turn paying tribute to
wildness it was finer and no mistake finer than spanish merino wild
wool is finer than tame

"here" said i "is an argument for fine wildness that needs no
explanation not that such arguments are by any means rare for all
wildness is finer than tameness but because fine wool is appreciable
by everybody alike from the most speculative president of national
wool-growers' associations all the way down to the gude-wife spinning by
her ingleside"

nature is a good mother and sees well to the clothing of her many
bairns birds with smoothly imbricated feathers beetles with shining
jackets and bears with shaggy furs in the tropical south where the
sun warms like a fire they are allowed to go thinly clad but in the
snowy northland she takes care to clothe warmly the squirrel has
socks and mittens and a tail broad enough for a blanket the grouse
is densely feathered down to the ends of his toes and the wild sheep
besides his undergarment of fine wool has a thick overcoat of hair that
sheds off both the snow and the rain other provisions and adaptations
in the dresses of animals relating less to climate than to the more
mechanical circumstances of life are made with the same consummate
skill that characterizes all the love work of nature land water and
air jagged rocks muddy ground sand beds forests underbrush grassy
plains etc are considered in all their possible combinations while
the clothing of her beautiful wildlings is preparing no matter what the
circumstances of their lives may be she never allows them to go dirty
or ragged the mole living always in the dark and in the dirt is
yet as clean as the otter or the wave-washed seal and our wild sheep
wading in snow roaming through bushes and leaping among jagged
storm-beaten cliffs wears a dress so exquisitely adapted to its
mountain life that it is always found as unruffled and stainless as a
bird

on leaving the shasta hunting grounds i selected a few specimen tufts
and brought them away with a view to making more leisurely examinations
but owing to the imperfectness of the instruments at my command the
results thus far obtained must be regarded only as rough approximations

as already stated the clothing of our wild sheep is composed of fine
wool and coarse hair the hairs are from about two to four inches long
mostly of a dull bluish-gray color though varying somewhat with the
seasons in general characteristics they are closely related to the
hairs of the deer and antelope being light spongy and elastic with
a highly polished surface and though somewhat ridged and spiraled
like wool they do not manifest the slightest tendency to felt or become
taggy a hair two and a half inches long which is perhaps near
the average length will stretch about one fourth of an inch before
breaking the diameter decreases rapidly both at the top and bottom but
is maintained throughout the greater portion of the length with a fair
degree of regularity the slender tapering point in which the hairs
terminate is nearly black but owing to its fineness as compared with
the main trunk the quantity of blackness is not sufficient to affect
greatly the general color the number of hairs growing upon a square
inch is about ten thousand the number of wool fibers is about
twenty-five thousand or two and a half times that of the hairs the
wool fibers are white and glossy and beautifully spired into ringlets
the average length of the staple is about an inch and a half a fiber
of this length when growing undisturbed down among the hairs measures
about an inch hence the degree of curliness may easily be inferred i
regret exceedingly that my instruments do not enable me to measure the
diameter of the fibers in order that their degrees of fineness might be
definitely compared with each other and with the finest of the domestic
breeds but that the three wild fleeces under consideration are
considerably finer than the average grades of merino shipped from san
francisco is i think unquestionable

when the fleece is parted and looked into with a good lens the skin
appears of a beautiful pale-yellow color and the delicate wool fibers
are seen growing up among the strong hairs like grass among stalks
of corn every individual fiber being protected about as specially and
effectively as if inclosed in a separate husk wild wool is too fine to
stand by itself the fibers being about as frail and invisible as the
floating threads of spiders while the hairs against which they
lean stand erect like hazel wands but notwithstanding their great
dissimilarity in size and appearance the wool and hair are forms of
the same thing modified in just that way and to just that degree that
renders them most perfectly subservient to the well-being of the sheep
furthermore it will be observed that these wild modifications are
entirely distinct from those which are brought chancingly into existence
through the accidents and caprices of culture the former being
inventions of god for the attainment of definite ends like the
modifications of limbs the fin for swimming the wing for flying the
foot for walking so the fine wool for warmth the hair for additional
warmth and to protect the wool and both together for a fabric to wear
well in mountain roughness and wash well in mountain storms

the effects of human culture upon wild wool are analogous to those
produced upon wild roses in the one case there is an abnormal
development of petals at the expense of the stamens in the other an
abnormal development of wool at the expense of the hair garden roses
frequently exhibit stamens in which the transmutation to petals may
be observed in various stages of accomplishment and analogously the
fleeces of tame sheep occasionally contain a few wild hairs that are
undergoing transmutation to wool even wild wool presents here and there
a fiber that appears to be in a state of change in the course of my
examinations of the wild fleeces mentioned above three fibers were
found that were wool at one end and hair at the other this however
does not necessarily imply imperfection or any process of change
similar to that caused by human culture water lilies contain parts
variously developed into stamens at one end petals at the other as
the constant and normal condition these half wool half hair fibers may
therefore subserve some fixed requirement essential to the perfection of
the whole or they may simply be the fine boundary-lines where and exact
balance between the wool and the hair is attained

i have been offering samples of mountain wool to my friends demanding
in return that the fineness of wildness be fairly recognized and
confessed but the returns are deplorably tame the first question
asked is "now truly wild sheep wild sheep have you any wool?" while
they peer curiously down among the hairs through lenses and spectacles
"yes wild sheep you have wool but mary's lamb had more in the name
of use how many wild sheep think you would be required to furnish
wool sufficient for a pair of socks?" i endeavor to point out the
irrelevancy of the latter question arguing that wild wool was not made
for man but for sheep and that however deficient as clothing for other
animals it is just the thing for the brave mountain-dweller that wears
it plain however as all this appears the quantity question rises
again and again in all its commonplace tameness for in my experience it
seems well-nigh impossible to obtain a hearing on behalf of nature from
any other standpoint than that of human use domestic flocks yield more
flannel per sheep than the wild therefore it is claimed that culture
has improved upon wildness and so it has as far as flannel is
concerned but all to the contrary as far as a sheep's dress is
concerned if every wild sheep inhabiting the sierra were to put on tame
wool probably only a few would survive the dangers of a single season
with their fine limbs muffled and buried beneath a tangle of hairless
wool they would become short-winded and fall an easy prey to the
strong mountain wolves in descending precipices they would be thrown
out of balance and killed by their taggy wool catching upon sharp
points of rocks disease would also be brought on by the dirt
which always finds a lodgment in tame wool and by the draggled and
water-soaked condition into which it falls during stormy weather

no dogma taught by the present civilization seems to form so insuperable
an obstacle in the way of a right understanding of the relations which
culture sustains to wildness as that which regards the world as made
especially for the uses of man every animal plant and crystal
controverts it in the plainest terms yet it is taught from century
to century as something ever new and precious and in the resulting
darkness the enormous conceit is allowed to go unchallenged

i have never yet happened upon a trace of evidence that seemed to show
that any one animal was ever made for another as much as it was made for
itself not that nature manifests any such thing as selfish isolation
in the making of every animal the presence of every other animal has
been recognized indeed every atom in creation may be said to be
acquainted with and married to every other but with universal union
there is a division sufficient in degree for the purposes of the most
intense individuality no matter therefore what may be the note
which any creature forms in the song of existence it is made first for
itself then more and more remotely for all the world and worlds

were it not for the exercise of individualizing cares on the part of
nature the universe would be felted together like a fleece of tame
wool but we are governed more than we know and most when we are
wildest plants animals and stars are all kept in place bridled
along appointed ways with one another and through the midst of one
another killing and being killed eating and being eaten in harmonious
proportions and quantities and it is right that we should thus
reciprocally make use of one another rob cook and consume to the
utmost of our healthy abilities and desires stars attract one another
as they are able and harmony results wild lambs eat as many wild
flowers as they can find or desire and men and wolves eat the lambs to
just the same extent

this consumption of one another in its various modifications is a
kind of culture varying with the degree of directness with which it is
carried out but we should be careful not to ascribe to such culture
any improving qualities upon those on whom it is brought to bear the
water-ousel plucks moss from the riverbank to build its nest but is
does not improve the moss by plucking it we pluck feathers from birds
and less directly wool from wild sheep for the manufacture of clothing
and cradle-nests without improving the wool for the sheep or the
feathers for the bird that wore them when a hawk pounces upon a linnet
and proceeds to pull out its feathers preparatory to making a meal
the hawk may be said to be cultivating the linnet and he certainly does
effect an improvement as far as hawk-food is concerned but what of the
songster? he ceases to be a linnet as soon as he is snatched from the
woodland choir and when hawklike we snatch the wild sheep from its
native rock and instead of eating and wearing it at once carry it
home and breed the hair out of its wool and the bones out of its body
it ceases to be a sheep

these breeding and plucking processes are similarly improving as regards
the secondary uses aimed at and although the one requires but a few
minutes for its accomplishment the other many years or centuries they
are essentially alike we eat wild oysters alive with great directness
waiting for no cultivation and leaving scarce a second of distance
between the shell and the lip but we take wild sheep home and subject
them to the many extended processes of husbandry and finish by boiling
them in a pot a process which completes all sheep improvements as far
as man is concerned it will be seen therefore that wild wool and tame
wool wild sheep and tame sheep are terms not properly comparable nor
are they in any correct sense to be considered as bearing any antagonism
toward each other they are different things planned and accomplished
for wholly different purposes

illustrative examples bearing upon this interesting subject may be
multiplied indefinitely for they abound everywhere in the plant and
animal kingdoms wherever culture has reached recurring for a moment to
apples the beauty and completeness of a wild apple tree living its own
life in the woods is heartily acknowledged by all those who have been so
happy as to form its acquaintance the fine wild piquancy of its fruit
is unrivaled but in the great question of quantity as human food wild
apples are found wanting man therefore takes the tree from the woods
manures and prunes and grafts plans and guesses adds a little of this
and that selects and rejects until apples of every conceivable size
and softness are produced like nut galls in response to the irritating
punctures of insects orchard apples are to me the most eloquent words
that culture has ever spoken but they reflect no imperfection upon
nature's spicy crab every cultivated apple is a crab not improved
but cooked variously softened and swelled out in the process mellowed
sweetened spiced and rendered pulpy and foodful but as utterly unfit
for the uses of nature as a meadowlark killed and plucked and roasted
give to nature every cultured apple codling pippin russet and every
sheep so laboriously compounded muffled southdowns hairy cotswolds
wrinkled merinos and she would throw the one to her caterpillars the
other to her wolves

it is now some thirty-six hundred years since jacob kissed his mother
and set out across the plains of padan-aram to begin his experiments
upon the flocks of his uncle laban and notwithstanding the high
degree of excellence he attained as a wool-grower and the innumerable
painstaking efforts subsequently made by individuals and associations
in all kinds of pastures and climates we still seem to be as far from
definite and satisfactory results as we ever were in one breed the
wool is apt to wither and crinkle like hay on a sun-beaten hillside in
another it is lodged and matted together like the lush tangled grass of
a manured meadow in one the staple is deficient in length in another
in fineness while in all there is a constant tendency toward disease
rendering various washings and dippings indispensable to prevent its
falling out the problem of the quality and quantity of the carcass
seems to be as doubtful and as far removed from a satisfactory solution
as that of the wool desirable breeds blundered upon by long series
of groping experiments are often found to be unstable and subject to
disease bots foot rot blind staggers etc causing infinite trouble
both among breeders and manufacturers would it not be well therefore
for some one to go back as far as possible and take a fresh start?

the source or sources whence the various breeds were derived is not
positively known but there can be hardly any doubt of their being
descendants of the four or five wild species so generally distributed
throughout the mountainous portions of the globe the marked differences
between the wild and domestic species being readily accounted for by the
known variability of the animal and by the long series of painstaking
selection to which all its characteristics have been subjected no other
animal seems to yield so submissively to the manipulations of culture
jacob controlled the color of his flocks merely by causing them to stare
at objects of the desired hue and possibly merinos may have caught
their wrinkles from the perplexed brows of their breeders the
california species (ovis montana) [2] is a noble animal weighing when
full-grown some three hundred and fifty pounds and is well worthy the
attention of wool-growers as a point from which to make a new departure
for pure wildness is the one great want both of men and of sheep




ii a geologist's winter walk [3]

after reaching turlock i sped afoot over the stubble fields and through
miles of brown hemizonia and purple erigeron to hopeton conscious
of little more than that the town was behind and beneath me and the
mountains above and before me on through the oaks and chaparral of the
foothills to coulterville and then ascended the first great mountain
step upon which grows the sugar pine here i slackened pace for i drank
the spicy resiny wind and beneath the arms of this noble tree i felt
that i was safely home never did pine trees seem so dear how sweet was
their breath and their song and how grandly they winnowed the sky i
tingled my fingers among their tassels and rustled my feet among their
brown needles and burrs and was exhilarated and joyful beyond all i can
write

when i reached yosemite all the rocks seemed talkative and more
telling and lovable than ever they are dear friends and seemed to have
warm blood gushing through their granite flesh and i love them with a
love intensified by long and close companionship after i had bathed in
the bright river sauntered over the meadows conversed with the domes
and played with the pines i still felt blurred and weary as if tainted
in some way with the sky of your streets i determined therefore to
run out for a while to say my prayers in the higher mountain temples
"the days are sunful" i said "and though now winter no great danger
need be encountered and no sudden storm will block my return if i am
watchful"

the morning after this decision i started up the canyon of tenaya
caring little about the quantity of bread i carried for i thought a
fast and a storm and a difficult canyon were just the medicine i needed
when i passed mirror lake i scarcely noticed it for i was absorbed
in the great tissiack her crown a mile away in the hushed azure her
purple granite drapery flowing in soft and graceful folds down to my
feet embroidered gloriously around with deep shadowy forest i have
gazed on tissiack a thousand times in days of solemn storms and when
her form shone divine with the jewelry of winter or was veiled in
living clouds and i have heard her voice of winds and snowy tuneful
waters when floods were falling yet never did her soul reveal itself
more impressively than now i hung about her skirts lingering timidly
until the higher mountains and glaciers compelled me to push up the
canyon

this canyon is accessible only to mountaineers and i was anxious to
carry my barometer and clinometer through it to obtain sections and
altitudes so i chose it as the most attractive highway after i had
passed the tall groves that stretch a mile above mirror lake and
scrambled around the tenaya fall which is just at the head of the lake
groves i crept through the dense and spiny chaparral that plushes the
roots of the mountains here for miles in warm green and was ascending
a precipitous rock front smoothed by glacial action when i suddenly
fell for the first time since i touched foot to sierra rocks after
several somersaults i became insensible from the shock and when
consciousness returned i found myself wedged among short stiff bushes
trembling as if cold not injured in the slightest

judging by the sun i could not have been insensible very long probably
not a minute possibly an hour and i could not remember what made
me fall or where i had fallen from but i saw that if i had rolled a
little further my mountain climbing would have been finished for just
beyond the bushes the canyon wall steepened and i might have fallen to
the bottom "there" said i addressing my feet to whose separate skill
i had learned to trust night and day on any mountain "that is what you
get by intercourse with stupid town stairs and dead pavements" i felt
degraded and worthless i had not yet reached the most difficult portion
of the canyon but i determined to guide my humbled body over the
most nerve-trying places i could find for i was now awake and felt
confident that the last of the town fog had been shaken from both head
and feet

i camped at the mouth of a narrow gorge which is cut into the bottom of
the main canyon determined to take earnest exercise next day no plushy
boughs did my ill-behaved bones enjoy that night nor did my bumped head
get a spicy cedar plume pillow mixed with flowers i slept on a naked
boulder and when i awoke all my nervous trembling was gone

the gorged portion of the canyon in which i spent all the next day is
about a mile and a half in length and i passed the time in tracing the
action of the forces that determined this peculiar bottom gorge which
is an abrupt ragged-walled narrow-throated canyon formed in the
bottom of the wide-mouthed smooth and beveled main canyon i will not
stop now to tell you more some day you may see it like a shadowy line
from cloud's rest in high water the stream occupies all the bottom of
the gorge surging and chafing in glorious power from wall to wall
but the sound of the grinding was low as i entered the gorge scarcely
hoping to be able to pass through its entire length by cool efforts
along glassy ice-worn slopes i reached the upper end in a little over
a day but was compelled to pass the second night in the gorge and in
the moonlight i wrote you this short pencil-letter in my notebook 


   the moon is looking down into the canyon and how marvelously the
   great rocks kindle to her light  every dome and brow and
   swelling boss touched by her white rays glows as if lighted with
   snow  i am now only a mile from last night's camp and have been
   climbing and sketching all day in this difficult but instructive
   gorge  it is formed in the bottom of the main canyon among the
   roots of cloud's rest  it begins at the filled-up lake basin where
   i camped last night and ends a few hundred yards above in another
   basin of the same kind  the walls everywhere are craggy and
   vertical and in some places they overlean  it is only from twenty
   to sixty feet wide and not though black and broken enough the
   thin crooked mouth of some mysterious abyss but it was eroded
   for in many places i saw its solid seamless floor

   i am sitting on a big stone against which the stream divides and
   goes brawling by in rapids on both sides half of my rock is white
   in the light half in shadow  as i look from the opening jaws of
   this shadowy gorge south dome is immediately in front high in the
   stars her face turned from the moon with the rest of her body
   gloriously muffled in waved folds of granite  on the left
   sculptured from the main cloud's rest ridge are three magnificent
   rocks sisters of the great south dome  on the right is the
   massive moonlit front of mount watkins and between low down in
   the furthest distance is sentinel dome girdled and darkened with
   forest  in the near foreground tenaya creek is singing against
   boulders that are white with snow and moonbeams  now look back
   twenty yards and you will see a waterfall fair as a spirit the
   moonlight just touches it bringing it into relief against a dark
   background of shadow  a little to the left and a dozen steps this
   side of the fall a flickering light marks my camp and a precious
   camp it is  a huge glacier-polished slab falling from the
   smooth glossy flank of cloud's rest happened to settle on edge
   against the wall of the gorge  i did not know that this slab was
   glacier-polished until i lighted my fire  judge of my delight  i
   think it was sent here by an earthquake  it is about twelve feet
   square  i wish i could take it home [4] for a hearthstone
   beneath this slab is the only place in this torrent-swept gorge
   where i could find sand sufficient for a bed

   i expected to sleep on the boulders for i spent most of the
   afternoon on the slippery wall of the canyon endeavoring to get
   around this difficult part of the gorge and was compelled to
   hasten down here for water before dark  i shall sleep soundly on
   this sand half of it is mica  here wonderful to behold are a
   few green stems of prickly rubus and a tiny grass  they are here
   to meet us  ay even here in this darksome gorge "frightened and
   tormented" with raging torrents and choking avalanches of snow
   can it be?  as if rubus and the grass leaf were not enough of god's
   tender prattle words of love which we so much need in these mighty
   temples of power yonder in the "benmost bore" are two blessed
   adiantums  listen to them  how wholly infused with god is this
   one big word of love that we call the world  good-night  do you
   see the fire-glow on my ice-smoothed slab and on my two ferns and
   the rubus and grass panicles?  and do you hear how sweet a sleep-
   song the fall and cascades are singing?

the water-ground chips and knots that i found fastened between the rocks
kept my fire alive all through the night next morning i rose nerved and
ready for another day of sketching and noting and any form of climbing
i escaped from the gorge about noon after accomplishing some of the
most delicate feats of mountaineering i ever attempted and here the
canyon is all broadly open again the floor luxuriantly forested with
pine and spruce and silver fir and brown-trunked libocedrus the
walls rise in yosemite forms and tenaya creek comes down seven hundred
feet in a white brush of foam this is a little yosemite valley it is
about two thousand feet above the level of the main yosemite and about
twenty-four hundred below lake tenaya

i found the lake frozen and the ice was so clear and unruffled that
the surrounding mountains and the groves that look down upon it were
reflected almost as perfectly as i ever beheld them in the calm evening
mirrors of summer at a little distance it was difficult to believe the
lake frozen at all and when i walked out on it cautiously stamping
at short intervals to test the strength of the ice i seemed to walk
mysteriously without adequate faith on the surface of the water
the ice was so transparent that i could see through it the beautifully
wave-rippled sandy bottom and the scales of mica glinting back the
down-pouring light when i knelt down with my face close to the ice
through which the sunbeams were pouring i was delighted to discover
myriads of tyndall's six-rayed water flowers magnificently colored

a grand old mountain mansion is this tenaya region in the glacier
period it was a mer de glace far grander than the mer de glace of
switzerland which is only about half a mile broad the tenaya mer de
glace was not less than two miles broad late in the glacier epoch when
all the principal dividing crests were bare and its depth was not less
than fifteen hundred feet ice streams from mounts lyell and dana and
all the mountains between and from the nearer cathedral peak flowed
hither welded into one and worked together after eroding this tanaya
lake basin and all the splendidly sculptured rocks and mountains that
surround and adorn it and the great tenaya canyon with its wealth of
all that makes mountains sublime they were welded with the vast south
lyell and illilouette glaciers on one side and with those of hoffman
on the other thus forming a portion of a yet grander mer de glace in
yosemite valley

i reached the tenaya canyon on my way home by coming in from the
northeast rambling down over the shoulders of mount watkins touching
bottom a mile above mirror lake from thence home was but a saunter in
the moonlight

after resting one day and the weather continuing calm i ran up over
the left shoulder of south dome and down in front of its grand split
face to make some measurements completed my work climbed to the right
shoulder struck off along the ridge for cloud's rest and reached the
topmost heave of her sunny wave in ample time to see the sunset

cloud's rest is a thousand feet higher than tissiack it is a wavelike
crest upon a ridge which begins at yosemite with tissiack and runs
continuously eastward to the thicket of peaks and crests around lake
tenaya this lofty granite wall is bent this way and that by the
restless and weariless action of glaciers just as if it had been made of
dough but the grand circumference of mountains and forests are coming
from far and near densing into one close assemblage for the sun their
god and father with love ineffable is glowing a sunset farewell not
one of all the assembled rocks or trees seemed remote how impressively
their faces shone with responsive love

i ran home in the moonlight with firm strides for the sun-love made
me strong down through the junipers down through the firs now in
jet shadows now in white light over sandy moraines and bare clanking
rocks past the huge ghost of south dome rising weird through the firs
past the glorious fall of nevada the groves of illilouette through the
pines of the valley beneath the bright crystal sky blazing with stars
all of this mountain wealth in one day one of the rich ripe days that
enlarge one's life so much of the sun upon one side of it so much of
the moon and stars on the other




iii summer days at mount shasta


mount shasta rises in solitary grandeur from the edge of a comparatively
low and lightly sculptured lava plain near the northern extremity of the
sierra and maintains a far more impressive and commanding individuality
than any other mountain within the limits of california go where you
may within a radius of from fifty to a hundred miles or more there
stands before you the colossal cone of shasta clad in ice and snow the
one grand unmistakable landmark the pole star of the landscape far
to the southward mount whitney lifts its granite summit four or five
hundred feet higher than shasta but it is nearly snowless during the
late summer and is so feebly individualized that the traveler may
search for it in vain among the many rival peaks crowded along the axis
of the range to north and south of it which all alike are crumbling
residual masses brought into relief in the degradation of the general
mass of the range the highest point on mount shasta as determined by
the state geological survey is 14440 feet above mean tide that of
whitney computed from fewer observations is about 14900 feet but
inasmuch as the average elevation of the plain out of which shasta rises
is only about four thousand feet above the sea while the actual base of
the peak of mount whitney lies at an elevation of eleven thousand feet
the individual height of the former is about two and a half times as
great as that of the latter

approaching shasta from the south one obtains glimpses of its snowy
cone here and there through the trees from the tops of hills and ridges
but it is not until strawberry valley is reached where there is a grand
out-opening of the forests that shasta is seen in all its glory from
base to crown clearly revealed with its wealth of woods and waters
and fountain snow rejoicing in the bright mountain sky and radiating
beauty on all the subject landscape like a sun standing in a fringing
thicket of purple spiraea in the immediate foreground is a smooth
expanse of green meadow with its meandering stream one of the smaller
affluents of the sacramento then a zone of dark close forest its
countless spires of pine and fir rising above one another on the
swelling base of the mountain in glorious array and over all the
great white cone sweeping far into the thin keen sky meadow forest
and grand icy summit harmoniously blending and making one sublime
picture evenly balanced

the main lines of the landscape are immensely bold and simple and so
regular that it needs all its shaggy wealth of woods and chaparral and
its finely tinted ice and snow and brown jutting crags to keep it from
looking conventional in general views of the mountain three distinct
zones may be readily defined the first which may be called the
chaparral zone extends around the base in a magnificent sweep nearly a
hundred miles in length on its lower edge and with a breadth of about
seven miles it is a dense growth of chaparral from three to six or
eight feet high composed chiefly of manzanita cherry chincapin and
several species of ceanothus called deerbrush by the hunters forming
when in full bloom one of the most glorious flowerbeds conceivable
the continuity of this flowery zone is interrupted here and there
especially on the south side of the mountain by wide swaths of
coniferous trees chiefly the sugar and yellow pines douglas spruce
silver fir and incense cedar many specimens of which are two hundred
feet high and five to seven feet in diameter goldenrods asters
gilias lilies and lupines with many other less conspicuous plants
occur in warm sheltered openings in these lower woods making charming
gardens of wildness where bees and butterflies are at home and many a
shy bird and squirrel

the next higher is the fir zone made up almost exclusively of two
species of silver fir it is from two to three miles wide has an
average elevation above the sea of some six thousand feet on its lower
edge and eight thousand on its upper and is the most regular and best
defined of the three

the alpine zone has a rugged straggling growth of storm-beaten dwarf
pines (pinus albicaulis) which forms the upper edge of the timberline
this species reaches an elevation of about nine thousand feet but at
this height the tops of the trees rise only a few feet into the thin
frosty air and are closely pressed and shorn by wind and snow yet they
hold on bravely and put forth an abundance of beautiful purple flowers
and produce cones and seeds down towards the edge of the fir belt they
stand erect forming small well-formed trunks and are associated with
the taller two-leafed and mountain pines and the beautiful williamson
spruce bryanthus a beautiful flowering heathwort flourishes a few
hundred feet above the timberline accompanied with kalmia and spiraea
lichens enliven the faces of the cliffs with their bright colors and in
some of the warmer nooks of the rocks up to a height of eleven
thousand feet there are a few tufts of dwarf daisies wallflowers
and penstemons but notwithstanding these bloom freely they make no
appreciable show at a distance and the stretches of rough brown lava
beyond the storm-beaten trees seem as bare of vegetation as the great
snow fields and glaciers of the summit

shasta is a fire-mountain an old volcano gradually accumulated and
built up into the blue deep of the sky by successive eruptions of ashes
and molten lava which shot high in the air and falling in darkening
showers and flowing from chasms and craters grew outward and upward
like the trunk of a knotty bulging tree not in one grand convulsion
was shasta given birth nor in any one special period of volcanic storm
and stress though mountains more than a thousand feet in height have
been cast up like molehills in a night quick contributions to the
wealth of the landscapes and most emphatic statements on the part of
nature of the gigantic character of the power that dwells beneath
the dull dead-looking surface of the earth but sections cut by the
glaciers displaying some of the internal framework of shasta show
that comparatively long periods of quiescence intervened between many
distinct eruptions during which the cooling lavas ceased to flow and
took their places as permanent additions to the bulk of the growing
mountain thus with alternate haste and deliberation eruption succeeded
eruption until mount shasta surpassed even its present sublime height

then followed a strange contrast the glacial winter came on the sky
that so often had been darkened with storms of cinders and ashes
and lighted by the glare of volcanic fires was filled with crystal
snow-flowers which loading the cooling mountain gave birth to
glaciers that uniting edge to edge at length formed one grand conical
glacier a down-crawling mantle of ice upon a fountain of smouldering
fire crushing and grinding its brown flinty lavas and thus degrading
and remodeling the entire mountain from summit to base how much
denudation and degradation has been effected we have no means of
determining the porous crumbling rocks being ill adapted for the
reception and preservation of glacial inscriptions

the summit is now a mass of ruins and all the finer striations have
been effaced from the flanks by post-glacial weathering while the
irregularity of its lavas as regards susceptibility to erosion and the
disturbance caused by inter- and post-glacial eruptions have obscured
or obliterated those heavier characters of the glacial record found
so clearly inscribed upon the granite pages of the high sierra between
latitude 36 degrees 30 minutes and 39 degrees this much however is
plain that the summit of the mountain was considerably lowered and the
sides were deeply grooved and fluted while it was a center of dispersal
for the glaciers of the circumjacent region and when at length
the glacial period began to draw near its close the ice mantle was
gradually melted off around the base of the mountain and in receding
and breaking up into its present fragmentary condition the irregular
heaps and rings of moraine matter were stored upon its flanks on which
the forests are growing the glacial erosion of most of the shasta lavas
gives rise to detritus composed of rough subangular boulders of moderate
size and porous gravel and sand which yields freely to the transporting
power of running water several centuries ago immense quantities of this
lighter material were washed down from the higher slopes by a flood of
extraordinary magnitude caused probably by the sudden melting of
the ice and snow during an eruption giving rise to the deposition
of conspicuous delta-like beds around the base and it is upon these
flood-beds of moraine soil thus suddenly and simultaneously laid down
and joined edge to edge that the flowery chaparral is growing

thus by forces seemingly antagonistic and destructive nature
accomplishes her beneficent designs now a flood of fire now a flood of
ice now a flood of water and again in the fullness of time an outburst
of organic life forest and garden with all their wealth of fruit and
flowers the air stirred into one universal hum with rejoicing insects
a milky way of wings and petals girdling the newborn mountain like a
cloud as if the vivifying sunbeams beating against its sides had broken
into a foam of plant-bloom and bees

but with such grand displays as nature is making here how grand are her
reservations bestowed only upon those who devotedly seek them beneath
the smooth and snowy surface the fountain fires are still aglow to
blaze forth afresh at their appointed times the glaciers looking so
still and small at a distance represented by the artist with a patch of
white paint laid on by a single stroke of his brush are still flowing
onward unhalting with deep crystal currents sculpturing the mountain
with stern resistless energy how many caves and fountains that no
eye has yet seen lie with all their fine furniture deep down in the
darkness and how many shy wild creatures are at home beneath the
grateful lights and shadows of the woods rejoicing in their fullness of
perfect life

standing on the edge of the strawberry meadows in the sun-days of
summer not a foot or feather or leaf seems to stir and the grand
towering mountain with all its inhabitants appears in rest calm as a
star yet how profound is the energy ever in action and how great is
the multitude of claws and teeth wings and eyes wide awake and at work
and shining going into the blessed wilderness the blood of the plants
throbbing beneath the life-giving sunshine seems to be heard and felt
plant growth goes on before our eyes and every tree and bush and flower
is seen as a hive of restless industry the deeps of the sky are
mottled with singing wings of every color and tone clouds of brilliant
chrysididae dancing and swirling in joyous rhythm golden-barred
vespidae butterflies grating cicadas and jolly rattling
grasshoppers fairly enameling the light and shaking all the air into
music happy fellows they are every one of them blowing tiny pipe and
trumpet plodding and prancing at work or at play

though winter holds the summit shasta in summer is mostly a massy
bossy mound of flowers colored like the alpenglow that flushes the
snow there are miles of wild roses pink bells of huckleberry and sweet
manzanita every bell a honey-cup plants that tell of the north and
of the south tall nodding lilies the crimson sarcodes rhododendron
cassiope and blessed linnaea phlox calycanthus plum cherry
crataegus spiraea mints and clovers in endless variety ivesia
larkspur and columbine golden aplopappus linosyris [5] bahia
wyethia arnica brodiaea etc making sheets and beds of light
edgings of bloom in lavish abundance for the myriads of the air
dependent on their bounty

the common honeybees gone wild in this sweet wilderness gather tons
of honey into the hollows of the trees and rocks clambering eagerly
through bramble and hucklebloom shaking the clustered bells of the
generous manzanita now humming aloft among polleny willows and firs
now down on the ashy ground among small gilias and buttercups and anon
plunging into banks of snowy cherry and buckthorn they consider the
lilies and roll into them pushing their blunt polleny faces against
them like babies on their mother's bosom and fondly too with eternal
love does mother nature clasp her small bee-babies and suckle them
multitudes at once on her warm shasta breast besides the common
honeybee there are many others here fine burly mossy fellows such as
were nourished on the mountains many a flowery century before the advent
of the domestic species bumblebees mason-bees carpenter-bees and
leaf-cutters butterflies too and moths of every size and pattern
some wide-winged like bats flapping slowly and sailing in easy curves
others like small flying violets shaking about loosely in short zigzag
flights close to the flowers feasting in plenty night and day

deer in great abundance come to shasta from the warmer foothills every
spring to feed in the rich cool pastures and bring forth their young
in the ceanothus tangles of the chaparral zone retiring again before
the snowstorms of winter mostly to the southward and westward of the
mountain in like manner the wild sheep of the adjacent region seek the
lofty inaccessible crags of the summit as the snow melts and are driven
down to the lower spurs and ridges where there is but little snow to
the north and east of shasta

bears too roam this foodful wilderness feeding on grass clover
berries nuts ant eggs fish flesh or fowl whatever comes in their
way with but little troublesome discrimination sugar and honey they
seem to like best of all and they seek far to find the sweets but when
hard pushed by hunger they make out to gnaw a living from the bark of
trees and rotten logs and might almost live on clean lava alone

notwithstanding the california bears have had as yet but little
experience with honeybees they sometimes succeed in reaching the
bountiful stores of these industrious gatherers and enjoy the feast with
majestic relish but most honeybees in search of a home are wise
enough to make choice of a hollow in a living tree far from the ground
whenever such can be found there they are pretty secure for though the
smaller brown and black bears climb well they are unable to gnaw their
way into strong hives while compelled to exert themselves to keep from
falling and at the same time endure the stings of the bees about the
nose and eyes without having their paws free to brush them off but woe
to the unfortunates who dwell in some prostrate trunk and to the black
bumblebees discovered in their mossy mouselike nests in the ground
with powerful teeth and claws these are speedily laid bare and almost
before time is given for a general buzz the bees old and young larvae
honey stings nest and all are devoured in one ravishing revel

the antelope may still be found in considerable numbers to the
northeastward of shasta but the elk once abundant have almost
entirely gone from the region the smaller animals such as the wolf
the various foxes wildcats coon squirrels and the curious wood rat
that builds large brush huts abound in all the wilder places and the
beaver otter mink etc may still be found along the sources of the
rivers the blue grouse and mountain quail are plentiful in the woods
and the sage-hen on the plains about the northern base of the mountain
while innumerable smaller birds enliven and sweeten every thicket and
grove


there are at least five classes of human inhabitants about the shasta
region the indians now scattered few in numbers and miserably
demoralized though still offering some rare specimens of savage
manhood miners and prospectors found mostly to the north and west of
the mountain since the region about its base is overflowed with lava
cattle-raisers mostly on the open plains to the northeastward and
around the klamath lakes hunters and trappers where the woods and
waters are wildest and farmers in shasta valley on the north side of
the mountain wheat apples melons berries all the best production
of farm and garden growing and ripening there at the foot of the great
white cone which seems at times during changing storms ready to fall
upon them the most sublime farm scenery imaginable

the indians of the mccloud river that have come under my observation
differ considerably in habits and features from the diggers and other
tribes of the foothills and plains and also from the pah utes and
modocs they live chiefly on salmon they seem to be closely related
to the tlingits of alaska washington and oregon and may readily have
found their way here by passing from stream to stream in which salmon
abound they have much better features than the indians of the plains
and are rather wide awake speculative and ambitious in their way and
garrulous like the natives of the northern coast

before the modoc war they lived in dread of the modocs a tribe living
about the klamath lake and the lava beds who were in the habit of
crossing the low sierra divide past the base of shasta on freebooting
excursions stealing wives fish and weapons from the pitts and
mcclouds mothers would hush their children by telling them that the
modocs would catch them

during my stay at the government fish-hatching station on the mccloud i
was accompanied in my walks along the riverbank by a mccloud boy about
ten years of age a bright inquisitive fellow who gave me the indian
names of the birds and plants that we met the water-ousel he knew well
and he seemed to like the sweet singer which he called "sussinny" he
showed me how strips of the stems of the beautiful maidenhair fern were
used to adorn baskets with handsome brown bands and pointed out several
plants good to eat particularly the large saxifrage growing abundantly
along the river margin once i rushed suddenly upon him to see if he
would be frightened but he unflinchingly held his ground struck a
grand heroic attitude and shouted "me no fraid me modoc"

mount shasta so far as i have seen has never been the home of indians
not even their hunting ground to any great extent above the lower
slopes of the base they are said to be afraid of fire-mountains and
geyser basins as being the dwelling places of dangerously powerful and
unmanageable gods however it is food and their relations to other
tribes that mainly control the movements of indians and here their food
was mostly on the lower slopes with nothing except the wild sheep
to tempt them higher even these were brought within reach without
excessive climbing during the storms of winter

on the north side of shasta near sheep rock there is a long cavern
sloping to the northward nearly a mile in length thirty or forty feet
wide and fifty feet or more in height regular in form and direction
like a railroad tunnel and probably formed by the flowing away of a
current of lava after the hardening of the surface at the mouth of this
cave where the light and shelter is good i found many of the heads and
horns of the wild sheep and the remains of campfires no doubt those of
indian hunters who in stormy weather had camped there and feasted after
the fatigues of the chase a wild picture that must have formed on a
dark night the glow of the fire the circle of crouching savages around
it seen through the smoke the dead game and the weird darkness and
half-darkness of the walls of the cavern a picture of cave-dwellers at
home in the stone age

interest in hunting is almost universal so deeply is it rooted as
an inherited instinct ever ready to rise and make itself known fine
scenery may not stir a fiber of mind or body but how quick and how true
is the excitement of the pursuit of game then up flames the slumbering
volcano of ancient wildness all that has been done by church and school
through centuries of cultivation is for the moment destroyed and
the decent gentleman or devout saint becomes a howling bloodthirsty
demented savage it is not long since we all were cavemen and followed
game for food as truly as wildcat or wolf and the long repression of
civilization seems to make the rebound to savage love of blood all the
more violent this frenzy fortunately does not last long in its most
exaggerated form and after a season of wildness refined gentlemen
from cities are not more cruel than hunters and trappers who kill for a
living

dwelling apart in the depths of the woods are the various kinds of
mountaineers hunters prospectors and the like rare men "queer
characters" and well worth knowing their cabins are located with
reference to game and the ledges to be examined and are constructed
almost as simply as those of the wood rats made of sticks laid across
each other without compass or square but they afford good shelter from
storms and so are "square" with the need of their builders these men
as a class are singularly fine in manners though their faces may be
scarred and rough like the bark of trees on entering their cabins you
will promptly be placed on your good behavior and your wants being
perceived with quick insight complete hospitality will be offered for
body and mind to the extent of the larder

these men know the mountains far and near and their thousand voices
like the leaves of a book they can tell where the deer may be found
at any time of year or day and what they are doing and so of all the
other furred and feathered people they meet in their walks and they can
send a thought to its mark as well as a bullet the aims of such people
are not always the highest yet how brave and manly and clean are their
lives compared with too many in crowded towns mildewed and dwarfed in
disease and crime how fine a chance is here to begin life anew in the
free fountains and skylands of shasta where it is so easy to live and
to die the future of the hunter is likely to be a good one no abrupt
change about it only a passing from wilderness to wilderness from one
high place to another

now that the railroad has been built up the sacramento everybody
with money may go to mount shasta the weak as well as the strong
fine-grained succulent people whose legs have never ripened as well
as sinewy mountaineers seasoned long in the weather this surely
is not the best way of going to the mountains yet it is better than
staying below many still small voices will not be heard in the noisy
rush and din suggestive of going to the sky in a chariot of fire or
a whirlwind as one is shot to the shasta mark in a booming palace-car
cartridge up the rocky canyon skimming the foaming river above the
level reaches above the dashing spray fine exhilarating translation
yet a pity to go so fast in a blur where so much might be seen and
enjoyed

the mountains are fountains not only of rivers and fertile soil but of
men therefore we are all in some sense mountaineers and going to the
mountains is going home yet how many are doomed to toil in town shadows
while the white mountains beckon all along the horizon up the canyon to
shasta would be a cure for all care but many on arrival seem at a loss
to know what to do with themselves and seek shelter in the hotel as
if that were the shasta they had come for others never leave the rail
content with the window views and cling to the comforts of the sleeping
car like blind mice to their mothers many are sick and have been
dragged to the healing wilderness unwillingly for body-good alone were
the parts of the human machine detachable like yankee inventions how
strange would be the gatherings on the mountains of pieces of people out
of repair

how sadly unlike the whole-hearted ongoing of the seeker after gold is
this partial compulsory mountaineering as if the mountain treasuries
contained nothing better than gold up the mountains they go
high-heeled and high-hatted laden like christian with mortifications
and mortgages of divers sorts and degrees some suffering from the sting
of bad bargains others exulting in good ones hunters and fishermen
with gun and rod and leggins blythe and jolly troubadours to whom all
shasta is romance poets singing their prayers the weak and the strong
unable or unwilling to bear mental taxation but whatever the motive
all will be in some measure benefited none may wholly escape the good
of nature however imperfectly exposed to her blessings the minister
will not preach a perfectly flat and sedimentary sermon after climbing a
snowy peak and the fair play and tremendous impartiality of nature
so tellingly displayed will surely affect the after pleadings of the
lawyer fresh air at least will get into everybody and the cares of
mere business will be quenched like the fires of a sinking ship

possibly a branch railroad may some time be built to the summit of mount
shasta like the road on mount washington in the mean time tourists
are dropped at sisson's about twelve miles from the summit whence as
headquarters they radiate in every direction to the so-called "points
of interest" sauntering about the flowery fringes of the strawberry
meadows bathing in the balm of the woods scrambling fishing hunting
riding about castle lake the mccloud river soda springs big spring
deer pastures and elsewhere some demand bears and make excited
inquiries concerning their haunts how many there might be altogether
on the mountain and whether they are grizzly brown or black others
shout "excelsior" and make off at once for the upper snow fields
most however are content with comparatively level ground and
moderate distances gathering at the hotel every evening laden with
trophies great sheaves of flowers cones of various trees cedar and
fir branches covered with yellow lichens and possibly a fish or two or
quail or grouse

but the heads of deer antelope wild sheep and bears are conspicuously
rare or altogether wanting in tourist collections in the "paradise of
hunters" there is a grand comparing of notes and adventures most are
exhilarated and happy though complaints may occasionally be heard "the
mountain does not look so very high after all nor so very white the
snow is in patches like rags spread out to dry" reminding one of sydney
smith's joke against jeffrey "d n the solar system bad light planets
too indistinct" but far the greater number are in good spirits showing
the influence of holiday enjoyment and mountain air fresh roses come to
cheeks that long have been pale and sentiment often begins to blossom
under the new inspiration

the shasta region may be reserved as a national park with special
reference to the preservation of its fine forests and game this should
by all means be done but as far as game is concerned it is in little
danger from tourists notwithstanding many of them carry guns and are
in some sense hunters going in noisy groups and with guns so shining
they are oftentimes confronted by inquisitive douglas squirrels and are
thus given opportunities for shooting but the larger animals retire at
their approach and seldom are seen other gun people too wise or too
lifeless to make much noise move slowly along the trails and about
the open spots of the woods like benumbed beetles in a snowdrift such
hunters are themselves hunted by the animals which in perfect safety
follow them out of curiosity

during the bright days of midsummer the ascent of shasta is only a long
safe saunter without fright or nerve strain or even serious fatigue
to those in sound health setting out from sisson's on horseback
accompanied by a guide leading a pack animal with provision blankets
and other necessaries you follow a trail that leads up to the edge of
the timberline where you camp for the night eight or ten miles from
the hotel at an elevation of about ten thousand feet the next day
rising early you may push on to the summit and return to sisson's but
it is better to spend more time in the enjoyment of the grand scenery
on the summit and about the head of the whitney glacier pass the second
night in camp and return to sisson's on the third day passing around
the margin of the meadows and on through the zones of the forest you
will have good opportunities to get ever-changing views of the mountain
and its wealth of creatures that bloom and breathe

the woods differ but little from those that clothe the mountains to the
southward the trees being slightly closer together and generally not
quite so large marking the incipient change from the open sunny forests
of the sierra to the dense damp forests of the northern coast where a
squirrel may travel in the branches of the thick-set trees hundreds of
miles without touching the ground around the upper belt of the forest
you may see gaps where the ground has been cleared by avalanches of
snow thousands of tons in weight which descending with grand rush and
roar brush the trees from their paths like so many fragile shrubs or
grasses

at first the ascent is very gradual the mountain begins to leave
the plain in slopes scarcely perceptible measuring from two to three
degrees these are continued by easy gradations mile after mile all the
way to the truncated crumbling summit where they attain a steepness
of twenty to twenty-five degrees the grand simplicity of these lines is
partially interrupted on the north subordinate cone that rises from the
side of the main cone about three thousand feet from the summit this
side cone past which your way to the summit lies was active after the
breaking-up of the main ice-cap of the glacial period as shown by the
comparatively unwasted crater in which it terminates and by streams of
fresh-looking unglaciated lava that radiate from it as a center

the main summit is about a mile and a half in diameter from southwest
to northeast and is nearly covered with snow and neve bounded by
crumbling peaks and ridges among which we look in vain for any sure
plan of an ancient crater the extreme summit is situated on the
southern end of a narrow ridge that bounds the general summit on the
east viewed from the north it appears as an irregular blunt point
about ten feet high and is fast disappearing before the stormy
atmospheric action to which it is subjected

at the base of the eastern ridge just below the extreme summit hot
sulphurous gases and vapor escape with a hissing bubbling noise from
a fissure in the lava some of the many small vents cast up a spray of
clear hot water which falls back repeatedly until wasted in vapor the
steam and spray seem to be produced simply by melting snow coming in the
way of the escaping gases while the gases are evidently derived from
the heated interior of the mountain and may be regarded as the last
feeble expression of the mighty power that lifted the entire mass of the
mountain from the volcanic depths far below the surface of the plain

the view from the summit in clear weather extends to an immense distance
in every direction southeastward the low volcanic portion of the
sierra is seen like a map both flanks as well as the crater-dotted
axis as far as lassen's butte [6] a prominent landmark and an old
volcano like shasta between ten and eleven thousand feet high
and distant about sixty miles some of the higher summit peaks near
independence lake one hundred and eighty miles away are at times
distinctly visible far to the north in oregon the snowy volcanic
cones of mounts pitt jefferson and the three sisters rise in clear
relief like majestic monuments above the dim dark sea of the northern
woods to the northeast lie the rhett and klamath lakes the lava beds
and a grand display of hill and mountain and gray rocky plains the
scott siskiyou and trinity mountains rise in long compact waves to
the west and southwest and the valley of the sacramento and the coast
mountains with their marvelous wealth of woods and waters are seen
while close around the base of the mountain lie the beautiful shasta
valley strawberry valley huckleberry valley and many others with the
headwaters of the shasta sacramento and mccloud rivers some observers
claim to have seen the ocean from the summit of shasta but i have not
yet been so fortunate

the cinder cone near lassen's butte is remarkable as being the scene
of the most recent volcanic eruption in the range it is a symmetrical
truncated cone covered with gray cinders and ashes with a regular
crater in which a few pines an inch or two in diameter are growing it
stands between two small lakes which previous to the last eruption when
the cone was built formed one lake from near the base of the cone a
flood of extremely rough black vesicular lava extends across what was
once a portion of the bottom of the lake into the forest of yellow pine

this lava flow seems to have been poured out during the same eruption
that gave birth to the cone cutting the lake in two flowing a little
way into the woods and overwhelming the trees in its way the ends of
some of the charred trunks still being visible projecting from beneath
the advanced snout of the flow where it came to rest while the floor of
the forest for miles around is so thickly strewn with loose cinders that
walking is very fatiguing the pitt river indians tell of a fearful time
of darkness probably due to this eruption when the sky was filled with
falling cinders which as they thought threatened every living creature
with destruction and say that when at length the sun appeared through
the gloom it was red like blood

less recent craters in great numbers dot the adjacent region some
with lakes in their throats some overgrown with trees others nearly
bare telling monuments of nature's mountain fires so often lighted
throughout the northern sierra and standing on the top of icy shasta
the mightiest fire-monument of them all we can hardly fail to look
forward to the blare and glare of its next eruption and wonder whether
it is nigh elsewhere men have planted gardens and vineyards in the
craters of volcanoes quiescent for ages and almost without warning have
been hurled into the sky more than a thousand years of profound calm
have been known to intervene between two violent eruptions seventeen
centuries intervened between two consecutive eruptions on the island of
ischia few volcanoes continue permanently in eruption like gigantic
geysers spouting hot stone instead of hot water they work and sleep
and we have no sure means of knowing whether they are only sleeping or
dead




iv a perilous night on shasta's summit


toward the end of summer after a light open winter one may reach the
summit of mount shasta without passing over much snow by keeping on the
crest of a long narrow ridge mostly bare that extends from near the
camp-ground at the timberline but on my first excursion to the summit
the whole mountain down to its low swelling base was smoothly laden
with loose fresh snow presenting a most glorious mass of winter
mountain scenery in the midst of which i scrambled and reveled or lay
snugly snowbound enjoying the fertile clouds and the snow-bloom in all
their growing drifting grandeur

i had walked from redding sauntering leisurely from station to station
along the old oregon stage road the better to see the rocks and plants
birds and people by the way tracing the rushing sacramento to its
fountains around icy shasta the first rains had fallen on the lowlands
and the first snows on the mountains and everything was fresh and
bracing while an abundance of balmy sunshine filled all the noonday
hours it was the calm afterglow that usually succeeds the first storm
of the winter i met many of the birds that had reared their young and
spent their summer in the shasta woods and chaparral they were then on
their way south to their winter homes leading their young full-fledged
and about as large and strong as the parents squirrels dry and elastic
after the storms were busy about their stores of pine nuts and the
latest goldenrods were still in bloom though it was now past the
middle of october the grand color glow the autumnal jubilee of ripe
leaves was past prime but freshened by the rain was still making a
fine show along the banks of the river and in the ravines and the dells
of the smaller streams

at the salmon-hatching establishment on the mccloud river i halted a
week to examine the limestone belt grandly developed there to learn
what i could of the inhabitants of the river and its banks and to give
time for the fresh snow that i knew had fallen on the mountain to
settle somewhat with a view to making the ascent a pedestrian on
these mountain roads especially so late in the year is sure to excite
curiosity and many were the interrogations concerning my ramble when i
said that i was simply taking a walk and that icy shasta was my mark i
was invariably admonished that i had come on a dangerous quest the time
was far too late the snow was too loose and deep to climb and i should
be lost in drifts and slides when i hinted that new snow was beautiful
and storms not so bad as they were called my advisers shook their heads
in token of superior knowledge and declared the ascent of "shasta butte"
through loose snow impossible nevertheless before noon of the second
of november i was in the frosty azure of the utmost summit

when i arrived at sisson's everything was quiet the last of the summer
visitors had flitted long before and the deer and bears also were
beginning to seek their winter homes my barometer and the sighing winds
and filmy half-transparent clouds that dimmed the sunshine gave notice
of the approach of another storm and i was in haste to be off and get
myself established somewhere in the midst of it whether the summit was
to be attained or not sisson who is a mountaineer speedily fitted me
out for storm or calm as only a mountaineer could with warm blankets
and a week's provisions so generous in quantity and kind that they
easily might have been made to last a month in case of my being closely
snowbound well i knew the weariness of snow-climbing and the frosts
and the dangers of mountaineering so late in the year therefore i could
not ask a guide to go with me even had one been willing all i wanted
was to have blankets and provisions deposited as far up in the timber as
the snow would permit a pack animal to go there i could build a
storm nest and lie warm and make raids up and around the mountain in
accordance with the weather

setting out on the afternoon of november first with jerome fay
mountaineer and guide in charge of the animals i was soon plodding
wearily upward through the muffled winter woods the snow of course
growing steadily deeper and looser so that we had to break a trail the
animals began to get discouraged and after night and darkness came on
they became entangled in a bed of rough lava where breaking through
four or five feet of mealy snow their feet were caught between angular
boulders here they were in danger of being lost but after we had
removed packs and saddles and assisted their efforts with ropes they
all escaped to the side of a ridge about a thousand feet below the
timberline

to go farther was out of the question so we were compelled to camp as
best we could a pitch pine fire speedily changed the temperature
and shed a blaze of light on the wild lava-slope and the straggling
storm-bent pines around us melted snow answered for coffee and we
had plenty of venison to roast toward midnight i rolled myself in my
blankets slept an hour and a half arose and ate more venison tied two
days' provisions to my belt and set out for the summit hoping to reach
it ere the coming storm should fall jerome accompanied me a little
distance above camp and indicated the way as well as he could in the
darkness he seemed loath to leave me but being reassured that i was
at home and required no care he bade me good-bye and returned to camp
ready to lead his animals down the mountain at daybreak

after i was above the dwarf pines it was fine practice pushing up the
broad unbroken slopes of snow alone in the solemn silence of the night
half the sky was clouded in the other half the stars sparkled icily in
the keen frosty air while everywhere the glorious wealth of snow fell
away from the summit of the cone in flowing folds more extensive and
continuous than any i had ever seen before when day dawned the clouds
were crawling slowly and becoming more massive but gave no intimation
of immediate danger and i pushed on faithfully though holding myself
well in hand ready to return to the timber for it was easy to see that
the storm was not far off the mountain rises ten thousand feet above
the general level of the country in blank exposure to the deep upper
currents of the sky and no labyrinth of peaks and canyons i had ever
been in seemed to me so dangerous as these immense slopes bare against
the sky

the frost was intense and drifting snow dust made breathing at times
rather difficult the snow was as dry as meal and the finer particles
drifted freely rising high in the air while the larger portions of
the crystals rolled like sand i frequently sank to my armpits between
buried blocks of loose lava but generally only to my knees when tired
with walking i still wallowed slowly upward on all fours the steepness
of the slope thirty-five degrees in some places made any kind of
progress fatiguing while small avalanches were being constantly set
in motion in the steepest places but the bracing air and the sublime
beauty of the snowy expanse thrilled every nerve and made absolute
exhaustion impossible i seemed to be walking and wallowing in a cloud
but holding steadily onward by half-past ten o'clock i had gained the
highest summit

i held my commanding foothold in the sky for two hours gazing on the
glorious landscapes spread maplike around the immense horizon and
tracing the outlines of the ancient lava-streams extending far into
the surrounding plains and the pathways of vanished glaciers of which
shasta had been the center but as i had left my coat in camp for the
sake of having my limbs free in climbing i soon was cold the wind
increased in violence raising the snow in magnificent drifts that were
drawn out in the form of wavering banners blowing in the sun toward the
end of my stay a succession of small clouds struck against the summit
rocks like drifting icebergs darkening the air as they passed and
producing a chill as definite and sudden as if ice-water had been dashed
in my face this is the kind of cloud in which snow-flowers grow and i
turned and fled

finding that i was not closely pursued i ventured to take time on the
way down for a visit to the head of the whitney glacier and the "crater
butte" after i had reached the end of the main summit ridge the descent
was but little more than one continuous soft mealy muffled slide most
luxurious and rapid though the hissing swishing speed attained was
obscured in great part by flying snow dust a marked contrast to the
boring seal-wallowing upward struggle i reached camp about an hour
before dusk hollowed a strip of loose ground in the lee of a large
block of red lava where firewood was abundant rolled myself in my
blankets and went to sleep

next morning having slept little the night before the ascent and being
weary with climbing after the excitement was over i slept late then
awaking suddenly my eyes opened on one of the most beautiful and
sublime scenes i ever enjoyed a boundless wilderness of storm clouds
of different degrees of ripeness were congregated over all the lower
landscape for thousands of square miles colored gray and purple and
pearl and deep-glowing white amid which i seemed to be floating while
the great white cone of the mountain above was all aglow in the
free blazing sunshine it seemed not so much an ocean as a land of
clouds undulating hill and dale smooth purple plains and silvery
mountains of cumuli range over range diversified with peak and dome
and hollow fully brought out in light and shade

i gazed enchanted but cold gray masses drifting like dust on a
wind-swept plain began to shut out the light forerunners of the coming
storm i had been so anxiously watching i made haste to gather as much
wood as possible snugging it as a shelter around my bed the storm
side of my blankets was fastened down with stakes to reduce as much as
possible the sifting-in of drift and the danger of being blown away the
precious bread sack was placed safely as a pillow and when at length
the first flakes fell i was exultingly ready to welcome them most of
my firewood was more than half rosin and would blaze in the face of the
fiercest drifting the winds could not demolish my bed and my bread
could be made to last indefinitely while in case of need i had the
means of making snowshoes and could retreat or hold my ground as i
pleased

presently the storm broke forth into full snowy bloom and the thronging
crystals darkened the air the wind swept past in hissing floods
grinding the snow into meal and sweeping down into the hollows in
enormous drifts all the heavier particles while the finer dust was
sifted through the sky increasing the icy gloom but my fire glowed
bravely as if in glad defiance of the drift to quench it and
notwithstanding but little trace of my nest could be seen after the
snow had leveled and buried it i was snug and warm and the passionate
uproar produced a glad excitement

day after day the storm continued piling snow on snow in weariless
abundance there were short periods of quiet when the sun would seem
to look eagerly down through rents in the clouds as if to know how
the work was advancing during these calm intervals i replenished my
fire sometimes without leaving the nest for fire and woodpile were
so near this could easily be done or busied myself with my notebook
watching the gestures of the trees in taking the snow examining
separate crystals under a lens and learning the methods of their
deposition as an enduring fountain for the streams several times when
the storm ceased for a few minutes a douglas squirrel came frisking
from the foot of a clump of dwarf pines moving in sudden interrupted
spurts over the bossy snow then without any apparent guidance he
would dig rapidly into the drift where were buried some grains of barley
that the horses had left the douglas squirrel does not strictly
belong to these upper woods and i was surprised to see him out in such
weather the mountain sheep also quite a large flock of them came to
my camp and took shelter beside a clump of matted dwarf pines a little
above my nest

the storm lasted about a week but before it was ended sisson became
alarmed and sent up the guide with animals to see what had become of me
and recover the camp outfit the news spread that "there was a man on
the mountain" and he must surely have perished and sisson was blamed
for allowing any one to attempt climbing in such weather while i was as
safe as anybody in the lowlands lying like a squirrel in a warm fluffy
nest busied about my own affairs and wishing only to be let alone
later however a trail could not have been broken for a horse and some
of the camp furniture would have had to be abandoned on the fifth day i
returned to sisson's and from that comfortable base made excursions
as the weather permitted to the black butte to the foot of the whitney
glacier around the base of the mountain to rhett and klamath lakes to
the modoc region and elsewhere developing many interesting scenes and
experiences

but the next spring on the other side of this eventful winter i saw
and felt still more of the shasta snow for then it was my fortune to
get into the very heart of a storm and to be held in it for a long
time

on the 28th of april [1875] i led a party up the mountain for the
purpose of making a survey of the summit with reference to the location
of the geodetic monument on the 30th accompanied by jerome fay i
made another ascent to make some barometrical observations the day
intervening between the two ascents being devoted to establishing a camp
on the extreme edge of the timberline here on our red trachyte bed
we obtained two hours of shallow sleep broken for occasional glimpses of
the keen starry night at two o'clock we rose breakfasted on a warmed
tin-cupful of coffee and a piece of frozen venison broiled on the coals
and started for the summit up to this time there was nothing in sight
that betokened the approach of a storm but on gaining the summit
we saw toward lassen's butte hundreds of square miles of white cumuli
boiling dreamily in the sunshine far beneath us and causing no alarm

the slight weariness of the ascent was soon rested away and our
glorious morning in the sky promised nothing but enjoyment at 9 am
the dry thermometer stood at 34 degrees in the shade and rose steadily
until at 1 pm it stood at 50 degrees probably influenced somewhat
by radiation from the sun-warmed cliffs a common bumblebee not at all
benumbed zigzagged vigorously about our heads for a few moments as if
unconscious of the fact that the nearest honey flower was a mile beneath
him

in the mean time clouds were growing down in shasta valley massive
swelling cumuli displaying delicious tones of purple and gray in the
hollows of their sun-beaten bosses extending gradually southward around
on both sides of shasta these at length united with the older field
towards lassen's butte thus encircling mount shasta in one continuous
cloud zone rhett and klamath lakes were eclipsed beneath clouds
scarcely less brilliant than their own silvery disks the modoc lava
beds many a snow-laden peak far north in oregon the scott and trinity
and siskiyou mountains the peaks of the sierra the blue coast range
shasta valley the dark forests filling the valley of the sacramento
all in turn were obscured or buried leaving the lofty cone on which we
stood solitary in the sunshine between two skies a sky of spotless
blue above a sky of glittering cloud beneath the creative sun shone
glorious on the vast expanse of cloudland hill and dale mountain and
valley springing into existence responsive to his rays and steadily
developing in beauty and individuality one huge mountain-cone of cloud
corresponding to mount shasta in these newborn cloud ranges rose close
alongside with a visible motion its firm polished bosses seeming so
near and substantial that we almost fancied that we might leap down upon
them from where we stood and make our way to the lowlands no hint was
given by anything in their appearance of the fleeting character of
these most sublime and beautiful cloud mountains on the contrary they
impressed one as being lasting additions to the landscape

the weather of the springtime and summer throughout the sierra in
general is usually varied by slight local rains and dustings of
snow most of which are obviously far too joyous and life-giving to be
regarded as storms single clouds growing in the sunny sky ripening
in an hour showering the heated landscape and passing away like a
thought leaving no visible bodily remains to stain the sky snowstorms
of the same gentle kind abound among the high peaks but in spring they
not unfrequently attain larger proportions assuming a violence and
energy of expression scarcely surpassed by those bred in the depths of
winter such was the storm now gathering about us

it began to declare itself shortly after noon suggesting to us the
idea of at once seeking our safe camp in the timber and abandoning the
purpose of making an observation of the barometer at 3 pm two having
already been made at 9 am and 12 m while simultaneous observations
were made at strawberry valley jerome peered at short intervals over
the ridge contemplating the rising clouds with anxious gestures in
the rough wind and at length declared that if we did not make a speedy
escape we should be compelled to pass the rest of the day and night
on the summit but anxiety to complete my observations stifled my
own instinctive promptings to retreat and held me to my work no
inexperienced person was depending on me and i told jerome that we
two mountaineers should be able to make our way down through any storm
likely to fall

presently thin fibrous films of cloud began to blow directly over the
summit from north to south drawn out in long fairy webs like carded
wool forming and dissolving as if by magic the wind twisted them into
ringlets and whirled them in a succession of graceful convolutions like
the outside sprays of yosemite falls in flood time then sailing out
into the thin azure over the precipitous brink of the ridge they were
drifted together like wreaths of foam on a river these higher and finer
cloud fabrics were evidently produced by the chilling of the air from
its own expansion caused by the upward deflection of the wind against
the slopes of the mountain they steadily increased on the north rim of
the cone forming at length a thick opaque ill-defined embankment from
the icy meshes of which snow-flowers began to fall alternating with
hail the sky speedily darkened and just as i had completed my last
observation and boxed my instruments ready for the descent the storm
began in serious earnest at first the cliffs were beaten with hail
every stone of which as far as i could see was regular in form
six-sided pyramids with rounded base rich and sumptuous-looking and
fashioned with loving care yet seemingly thrown away on those desolate
crags down which they went rolling falling sliding in a network of
curious streams

after we had forced our way down the ridge and past the group of hissing
fumaroles the storm became inconceivably violent the thermometer fell
22 degrees in a few minutes and soon dropped below zero the hail gave
place to snow and darkness came on like night the wind rising to the
highest pitch of violence boomed and surged amid the desolate crags
lightning flashes in quick succession cut the gloomy darkness and the
thunders the most tremendously loud and appalling i ever heard made
an almost continuous roar stroke following stroke in quick passionate
succession as though the mountain were being rent to its foundations
and the fires of the old volcano were breaking forth again

could we at once have begun to descend the snow slopes leading to the
timber we might have made good our escape however dark and wild the
storm as it was we had first to make our way along a dangerous
ridge nearly a mile and a half long flanked in many places by steep
ice-slopes at the head of the whitney glacier on one side and by
shattered precipices on the other apprehensive of this coming darkness
i had taken the precaution when the storm began to make the most
dangerous points clear to my mind and to mark their relations with
reference to the direction of the wind when therefore the darkness
came on and the bewildering drift i felt confident that we could
force our way through it with no other guidance after passing the "hot
springs" i halted in the lee of a lava-block to let jerome who had
fallen a little behind come up here he opened a council in which
under circumstances sufficiently exciting but without evincing any
bewilderment he maintained in opposition to my views that it was
impossible to proceed he firmly refused to make the venture to find the
camp while i aware of the dangers that would necessarily attend our
efforts and conscious of being the cause of his present peril decided
not to leave him

 our discussions ended jerome made a dash from the shelter of the
lava-block and began forcing his way back against the wind to the "hot
springs" wavering and struggling to resist being carried away as if he
were fording a rapid stream after waiting and watching in vain for
some flaw in the storm that might be urged as a new argument in favor of
attempting the descent i was compelled to follow "here" said jerome
as we shivered in the midst of the hissing sputtering fumaroles "we
shall be safe from frost" "yes" said i "we can lie in this mud and
steam and sludge warm at least on one side but how can we protect our
lungs from the acid gases and how after our clothing is saturated
shall we be able to reach camp without freezing even after the storm is
over? we shall have to wait for sunshine and when will it come?"

the tempered area to which we had committed ourselves extended over
about one fourth of an acre but it was only about an eighth of an inch
in thickness for the scalding gas jets were shorn off close to the
ground by the oversweeping flood of frosty wind and how lavishly the
snow fell only mountaineers may know the crisp crystal flowers seemed
to touch one another and fairly to thicken the tremendous blast that
carried them this was the bloom-time the summer of the cloud and
never before have i seen even a mountain cloud flowering so profusely

when the bloom of the shasta chaparral is falling the ground is
sometimes covered for hundreds of square miles to a depth of half an
inch but the bloom of this fertile snow cloud grew and matured and fell
to a depth of two feet in a few hours some crystals landed with their
rays almost perfect but most of them were worn and broken by striking
against one another or by rolling on the ground the touch of these
snow-flowers in calm weather is infinitely gentle glinting swaying
settling silently in the dry mountain air or massed in flakes soft and
downy to lie out alone in the mountains of a still night and be
touched by the first of these small silent messengers from the sky is a
memorable experience and the fineness of that touch none will forget
but the storm-blast laden with crisp sharp snow seems to crush and
bruise and stupefy with its multitude of stings and compels the bravest
to turn and flee

the snow fell without abatement until an hour or two after what seemed
to be the natural darkness of the night up to the time the storm first
broke on the summit its development was remarkably gentle there was a
deliberate growth of clouds a weaving of translucent tissue above then
the roar of the wind and the thunder and the darkening flight of snow
its subsidence was not less sudden the clouds broke and vanished not
a crystal was left in the sky and the stars shone out with pure and
tranquil radiance

during the storm we lay on our backs so as to present as little surface
as possible to the wind and to let the drift pass over us the mealy
snow sifted into the folds of our clothing and in many places reached
the skin we were glad at first to see the snow packing about us hoping
it would deaden the force of the wind but it soon froze into a stiff
crusty heap as the temperature fell rather augmenting our novel misery

when the heat became unendurable on some spot where steam was escaping
through the sludge we tried to stop it with snow and mud or shifted
a little at a time by shoving with our heels for to stand in blank
exposure to the fearful wind in our frozen-and-broiled condition seemed
certain death the acrid incrustations sublimed from the escaping gases
frequently gave way opening new vents to scald us and fearing that
if at any time the wind should fall carbonic acid which often formed
a considerable portion of the gaseous exhalations of volcanoes might
collect in sufficient quantities to cause sleep and death i warned
jerome against forgetting himself for a single moment even should his
sufferings admit of such a thing

accordingly when during the long dreary watches of the night we roused
from a state of half-consciousness we called each other by name in a
frightened startled way each fearing the other might be benumbed or
dead the ordinary sensations of cold give but a faint conception of
that which comes on after hard climbing with want of food and sleep
in such exposure as this life is then seen to be a fire that now
smoulders now brightens and may be easily quenched the weary hours
wore away like dim half-forgotten years so long and eventful they
seemed though we did nothing but suffer still the pain was not always
of that bitter intense kind that precludes thought and takes away all
capacity for enjoyment a sort of dreamy stupor came on at times in
which we fancied we saw dry resinous logs suitable for campfires just
as after going days without food men fancy they see bread

frozen blistered famished benumbed our bodies seemed lost to us at
times all dead but the eyes for the duller and fainter we became the
clearer was our vision though only in momentary glimpses then after
the sky cleared we gazed at the stars blessed immortals of light
shining with marvelous brightness with long lance rays near-looking and
new-looking as if never seen before again they would look familiar and
remind us of stargazing at home oftentimes imagination coming into play
would present charming pictures of the warm zone below mingled with
others near and far then the bitter wind and the drift would break
the blissful vision and dreary pains cover us like clouds "are you
suffering much?" jerome would inquire with pitiful faintness "yes"
i would say striving to keep my voice brave "frozen and burned but
never mind jerome the night will wear away at last and tomorrow we
go a-maying and what campfires we will make and what sunbaths we will
take"

the frost grew more and more intense and we became icy and covered over
with a crust of frozen snow as if we had lain cast away in the drift
all winter in about thirteen hours every hour like a year day began
to dawn but it was long ere the summit's rocks were touched by the sun
no clouds were visible from where we lay yet the morning was dull
and blue and bitterly frosty and hour after hour passed by while we
eagerly watched the pale light stealing down the ridge to the hollow
where we lay but there was not a trace of that warm flushing sunrise
splendor we so long had hoped for

as the time drew near to make an effort to reach camp we became
concerned to know what strength was left us and whether or no we could
walk for we had lain flat all this time without once rising to our
feet mountaineers however always find in themselves a reserve of
power after great exhaustion it is a kind of second life available
only in emergencies like this and having proved its existence i had
no great fear that either of us would fail though one of my arms was
already benumbed and hung powerless

at length after the temperature was somewhat mitigated on this
memorable first of may we arose and began to struggle homeward our
frozen trousers could scarcely be made to bend at the knee and we waded
the snow with difficulty the summit ridge was fortunately wind-swept
and nearly bare so we were not compelled to lift our feet high and
on reaching the long home slopes laden with loose snow we made rapid
progress sliding and shuffling and pitching headlong our feebleness
accelerating rather than diminishing our speed when we had descended
some three thousand feet the sunshine warmed our backs and we began to
revive at 10 am we reached the timber and were safe

half an hour later we heard sisson shouting down among the firs coming
with horses to take us to the hotel after breaking a trail through the
snow as far as possible he had tied his animals and walked up we had
been so long without food that we cared but little about eating but we
eagerly drank the coffee he prepared for us our feet were frozen and
thawing them was painful and had to be done very slowly by keeping them
buried in soft snow for several hours which avoided permanent damage
five thousand feet below the summit we found only three inches of new
snow and at the base of the mountain only a slight shower of rain
had fallen showing how local our storm had been notwithstanding
its terrific fury our feet were wrapped in sacking and we were soon
mounted and on our way down into the thick sunshine "god's country"
as sisson calls the chaparral zone in two hours' ride the last snowbank
was left behind violets appeared along the edges of the trail and the
chaparral was coming into bloom with young lilies and larkspurs about
the open places in rich profusion how beautiful seemed the golden
sunbeams streaming through the woods between the warm brown boles of the
cedars and pines all my friends among the birds and plants seemed
like old friends and we felt like speaking to every one of them as we
passed as if we had been a long time away in some far strange country

in the afternoon we reached strawberry valley and fell asleep next
morning we seemed to have risen from the dead my bedroom was flooded
with sunshine and from the window i saw the great white shasta
cone clad in forests and clouds and bearing them loftily in the sky
everything seemed full and radiant with the freshness and beauty and
enthusiasm of youth sisson's children came in with flowers and covered
my bed and the storm on the mountaintop banished like a dream




v shasta rambles and modoc memories


arctic beauty and desolation with their blessings and dangers all may
be found here to test the endurance and skill of adventurous climbers
but far better than climbing the mountain is going around its warm
fertile base enjoying its bounties like a bee circling around a bank
of flowers the distance is about a hundred miles and will take some
of the time we hear so much about a week or two but the benefits will
compensate for any number of weeks perhaps the profession of doing good
may be full but every body should be kind at least to himself take a
course of good water and air and in the eternal youth of nature you may
renew your own go quietly alone no harm will befall you some have
strange morbid fears as soon as they find themselves with nature even
in the kindest and wildest of her solitudes like very sick children
afraid of their mother as if god were dead and the devil were king

one may make the trip on horseback or in a carriage even for a good
level road may be found all the way round by shasta valley sheep rock
elk flat huckleberry valley squaw valley following for a considerable
portion of the way the old emigrant road which lies along the east
disk of the mountain and is deeply worn by the wagons of the early
gold-seekers many of whom chose this northern route as perhaps being
safer and easier the pass here being only about six thousand feet above
sea level but it is far better to go afoot then you are free to
make wide waverings and zigzags away from the roads to visit the great
fountain streams of the rivers the glaciers also and the wildest
retreats in the primeval forests where the best plants and animals
dwell and where many a flower-bell will ring against your knees and
friendly trees will reach out their fronded branches and touch you as
you pass one blanket will be enough to carry or you may forego
the pleasure and burden altogether as wood for fires is everywhere
abundant only a little food will be required berries and plums abound
in season and quail and grouse and deer the magnificent shaggy mule
deer as well as the common species

as you sweep around so grand a center the mountain itself seems to
turn displaying its riches like the revolving pyramids in jewelers'
windows one glacier after another comes into view and the outlines of
the mountain are ever changing though all the way around from whatever
point of view the form is maintained of a grand simple cone with a
gently sloping base and rugged crumbling ridges separating the glaciers
and the snowfields more or less completely the play of colors from the
first touches of the morning sun on the summit down the snowfields and
the ice and lava until the forests are aglow is a never-ending delight
the rosy lava and the fine flushings of the snow being ineffably lovely
thus one saunters on and on in the glorious radiance in utter peace and
forgetfulness of time

yet strange to say there are days even here somewhat dull-looking
when the mountain seems uncommunicative sending out no appreciable
invitation as if not at home at such time its height seems much less
as if crouching and weary it were taking rest but shasta is always
at home to those who love her and is ever in a thrill of enthusiastic
activity burning fires within grinding glaciers without and fountains
ever flowing every crystal dances responsive to the touches of the sun
and currents of sap in the growing cells of all the vegetation are ever
in a vital whirl and rush and though many feet and wings are folded
how many are astir and the wandering winds how busy they are and what
a breadth of sound and motion they make glinting and bubbling about the
crags of the summit sifting through the woods feeling their way from
grove to grove ruffling the loose hair on the shoulders of the bears
fanning and rocking young birds in their cradles making a trumpet of
every corolla and carrying their fragrance around the world

in unsettled weather when storms are growing the mountain looms
immensely higher and its miles of height become apparent to all
especially in the gloom of the gathering clouds or when the storm is
done and they are rolling away torn on the edges and melting while in
the sunshine slight rainstorms are likely to be encountered in a
trip round the mountain but one may easily find shelter beneath
well-thatched trees that shed the rain like a roof then the shining of
the wet leaves is delightful and the steamy fragrance and the burst
of bird song from a multitude of thrushes and finches and warblers that
have nests in the chaparral

the nights too are delightful watching with shasta beneath the great
starry dome a thousand thousand voices are heard but so finely blended
they seem a part of the night itself and make a deeper silence and how
grandly do the great logs and branches of your campfire give forth the
heat and light that during their long century-lives they have so slowly
gathered from the sun storing it away in beautiful dotted cells and
beads of amber gum the neighboring trees look into the charmed circle
as if the noon of another day had come familiar flowers and grasses
that chance to be near seem far more beautiful and impressive than by
day and as the dead trees give forth their light all the other riches
of their lives seem to be set free and with the rejoicing flames rise
again to the sky in setting out from strawberry valley by bearing off
to the northwestward a few miles you may see

   "beneath dim aisles in odorous beds
    the slight linnaea hang its twin-born heads
    and [bless] the monument of the man of flowers
    which breathes his sweet fame through the northern bowers"

this is one of the few places in california where the charming linnaea
is found though it is common to the northward through oregon
and washington here too you may find the curious but unlovable
darlingtonia a carnivorous plant that devours bumblebees grasshoppers
ants moths and other insects with insatiable appetite in approaching
it its suspicious-looking yellow-spotted hood and watchful attitude
will be likely to make you go cautiously through the bog where it
stands as if you were approaching a dangerous snake it also occurs in
a bog near sothern's station on the stage road where i first saw it
and in other similar bogs throughout the mountains hereabouts

the "big spring" of the sacramento is about a mile and a half above
sisson's issuing from the base of a drift-covered hill it is lined
with emerald algae and mosses and shaded with alder willow and thorn
bushes which give it a fine setting its waters apparently unaffected
by flood or drouth heat or cold fall at once into white rapids with
a rush and dash as if glad to escape from the darkness to begin their
wild course down the canyon to the plain

muir's peak a few miles to the north of the spring rises about three
thousand feet above the plain on which it stands and is easily climbed
the view is very fine and well repays the slight walk to its summit
from which much of your way about the mountain may be studied and
chosen the view obtained of the whitney glacier should tempt you to
visit it since it is the largest of the shasta glaciers and its lower
portion abounds in beautiful and interesting cascades and crevasses it
is three or four miles long and terminates at an elevation of about nine
thousand five hundred feet above sea level in moraine-sprinkled ice
cliffs sixty feet high the long gray slopes leading up to the glacier
seem remarkably smooth and unbroken they are much interrupted
nevertheless with abrupt jagged precipitous gorges which though
offering instructive sections of the lavas for examination would better
be shunned by most people this may be done by keeping well down on the
base until fronting the glacier before beginning the ascent

the gorge through which the glacier is drained is raw-looking deep and
narrow and indescribably jagged the walls in many places overhang in
others they are beveled loose and shifting where the channel has
been eroded by cinders ashes strata of firm lavas and glacial drift
telling of many a change from frost to fire and their attendant floods
of mud and water most of the drainage of the glacier vanishes at once
in the porous rocks to reappear in springs in the distant valley and it
is only in time of flood that the channel carries much water then there
are several fine falls in the gorge six hundred feet or more in height
snow lies in it the year round at an elevation of eight thousand five
hundred feet and in sheltered spots a thousand feet lower tracing this
wild changing channel-gorge gully or canyon the sections will show
mount shasta as a huge palimpsest containing the records layer upon
layer of strangely contrasted events in its fiery-icy history but
look well to your footing for the way will test the skill of the most
cautious mountaineers

regaining the low ground at the base of the mountain and holding on in
your grand orbit you pass through a belt of juniper woods called "the
cedars" to sheep rock at the foot of the shasta pass here you strike
the old emigrant road which leads over the low divide to the eastern
slopes of the mountain in a north-northwesterly direction from the foot
of the pass you may chance to find pluto's cave already mentioned but
it is not easily found since its several mouths are on a level with
the general surface of the ground and have been made simply by the
falling-in of portions of the roof far the most beautiful and richly
furnished of the mountain caves of california occur in a thick belt
of metamorphic limestone that is pretty generally developed along the
western flank of the sierra from the mccloud river to the kaweah a
distance of nearly four hundred miles these volcanic caves are not
wanting in interest and it is well to light a pitch pine torch and take
a walk in these dark ways of the underworld whenever opportunity offers
if for no other reason to see with new appreciation on returning to the
sunshine the beauties that lie so thick about us

sheep rock is about twenty miles from sisson's and is one of the
principal winter pasture grounds of the wild sheep from which it takes
its name it is a mass of lava presenting to the gray sage plain of
shasta valley a bold craggy front two thousand feet high its summit
lies at an elevation of five thousand five hundred feet above the sea
and has several square miles of comparatively level surface where
bunchgrass grows and the snow does not lie deep thus allowing the hardy
sheep to pick up a living through the winter months when deep snows have
driven them down from the lofty ridges of shasta

from here it might be well to leave the immediate base of the mountain
for a few days and visit the lava beds made famous by the modoc war
they lie about forty miles to the northeastward on the south shore
of rhett or tule [7] lake at an elevation above sea level of about
forty-five hundred feet they are a portion of a flow of dense black
vesicular lava dipping northeastward at a low angle but little changed
as yet by the weather and about as destitute of soil as a glacial
pavement the surface though smooth in a general way as seen from
a distance is dotted with hillocks and rough crater-like pits and
traversed by a network of yawning fissures forming a combination of
topographical conditions of very striking character the way lies by
mount bremer over stretches of gray sage plains interrupted by rough
lava slopes timbered with juniper and yellow pine and with here and
there a green meadow and a stream

this is a famous game region and you will be likely to meet small bands
of antelope mule deer and wild sheep mount bremer is the most noted
stronghold of the sheep in the whole shasta region large flocks dwell
here from year to year winter and summer descending occasionally into
the adjacent sage plains and lava beds to feed but ever ready to take
refuge in the jagged crags of their mountain at every alarm while
traveling with a company of hunters i saw about fifty in one flock

the van bremer brothers after whom the mountain is named told me that
they once climbed the mountain with their rifles and hounds on a grand
hunt but after keeping up the pursuit for a week their boots and
clothing gave way and the hounds were lamed and worn out without having
run down a single sheep notwithstanding they ran night and day on
smooth spots level or ascending the hounds gained on the sheep but
on descending ground and over rough masses of angular rocks they fell
hopelessly behind only half a dozen sheep were shot as they passed the
hunters stationed near their paths circling round the rugged summit the
full-grown bucks weigh nearly three hundred and fifty pounds

the mule deer are nearly as heavy their long massive ears give them
a very striking appearance one large buck that i measured stood three
feet and seven inches high at the shoulders and when the ears were
extended horizontally the distance across from tip to tip was two feet
and one inch

from the van bremer ranch the way to the lava beds leads down the bremer
meadows past many a smooth grassy knoll and jutting cliff along the
shore of lower klamath lake and thence across a few miles of sage plain
to the brow of the wall-like bluff of lava four hundred and fifty feet
above tule lake here you are looking southeastward and the modoc
landscape which at once takes possession of you lies revealed in
front it is composed of three principal parts on your left lies the
bright expanse of tule lake on your right an evergreen forest and
between the two are the black lava beds

when i first stood there one bright day before sundown the lake was
fairly blooming in purple light and was so responsive to the sky in
both calmness and color it seemed itself a sky no mountain shore hides
its loveliness it lies wide open for many a mile veiled in no mystery
but the mystery of light the forest also was flooded with sun-purple
not a spire moving and mount shasta was seen towering above it
rejoicing in the ineffable beauty of the alpenglow but neither the
glorified woods on the one hand nor the lake on the other could
at first hold the eye that dark mysterious lava plain between them
compelled attention here you trace yawning fissures there clusters
of somber pits now you mark where the lava is bent and corrugated in
swelling ridges and domes again where it breaks into a rough mass of
loose blocks tufts of grass grow far apart here and there and small
bushes of hardy sage but they have a singed appearance and can do
little to hide the blackness deserts are charming to those who know how
to see them all kinds of bogs barrens and heathy moors but the modoc
lava beds have for me an uncanny look as i gazed the purple deepened
over all the landscape then fell the gloaming making everything still
more forbidding and mysterious then darkness like death

next morning the crisp sunshiny air made even the modoc landscape less
hopeless and we ventured down the bluff to the edge of the lava beds
just at the foot of the bluff we came to a square enclosed by a stone
wall this is a graveyard where lie buried thirty soldiers most of whom
met their fate out in the lava beds as we learn by the boards marking
the graves a gloomy place to die in and deadly-looking even without
modocs the poor fellows that lie here deserve far more pity than they
have ever received picking our way over the strange ridges and hollows
of the beds we soon came to a circular flat about twenty yards in
diameter on the shore of the lake where the comparative smoothness of
the lava and a few handfuls of soil have caused the grass tufts to grow
taller this is where general canby was slain while seeking to make
peace with the treacherous modocs

two or three miles farther on is the main stronghold of the modocs held
by them so long and defiantly against all the soldiers that could be
brought to the attack indians usually choose to hide in tall grass and
bush and behind trees where they can crouch and glide like panthers
without casting up defenses that would betray their positions but the
modoc castle is in the rock when the yosemite indians made raids on
the settlers of the lower merced they withdrew with their spoils into
yosemite valley and the modocs boasted that in case of war they had a
stone house into which no white man could come as long as they cared to
defend it yosemite was not held for a single day against the pursuing
troops but the modocs held their fort for months until weary of being
hemmed in they chose to withdraw

it consists of numerous redoubts formed by the unequal subsidence
of portions of the lava flow and a complicated network of redans
abundantly supplied with salient and re-entering angles being united
each to the other and to the redoubts by a labyrinth of open and covered
corridors some of which expand at intervals into spacious caverns
forming as a whole the most complete natural gibraltar i ever saw other
castles scarcely less strong are connected with this by subterranean
passages known only to the indians while the unnatural blackness of the
rock out of which nature has constructed these defenses and the weird
inhuman physiognomy of the whole region are well calculated to inspire
terror

deadly was the task of storming such a place the breech-loading rifles
of the indians thrust through chinks between the rocks were ready
to pick off every soldier who showed himself for a moment while the
indians lay utterly invisible they were familiar with byways both over
and under ground and could at any time sink suddenly out of sight like
squirrels among the loose boulders our bewildered soldiers heard them
shooting now before now behind them as they glided from place
to place through fissures and subterranean passes all the while as
invisible as gyges wearing his magic ring to judge from the few i
have seen modocs are not very amiable-looking people at best when
therefore they were crawling stealthily in the gloomy caverns unkempt
and begrimed and with the glare of war in their eyes they must have
seemed very demons of the volcanic pit

captain jack's cave is one of the many somber cells of the castle it
measures twenty-five or thirty feet in diameter at the entrance and
extends but a short distance in a horizontal direction the floor is
littered with the bones of the animals slaughtered for food during the
war some eager archaeologist may hereafter discover this cabin and
startle his world by announcing another of the stone age caves the
sun shines freely into its mouth and graceful bunches of grass and
eriogonums and sage grow about it doing what they can toward its
redemption from degrading associations and making it beautiful

where the lava meets the lake there are some fine curving bays
beautifully embroidered with rushes and polygonums a favorite resort of
waterfowl on our return keeping close along shore we caused a noisy
plashing and beating of wings among cranes and geese the ducks less
wary kept their places merely swimming in and out through openings
in the rushes rippling the glassy water and raising spangles in their
wake the countenance of the lava beds became less and less forbidding
tufts of pale grasses relieved on the jet rocks looked like ornaments
on a mantel thick-furred mats of emerald mosses appeared in damp spots
next the shore and i noticed one tuft of small ferns from year to year
in the kindly weather the beds are thus gathering beauty beauty for
ashes

returning to sheep rock and following the old emigrant road one is soon
back again beneath the snows and shadows of shasta and the ash creek
and mccloud glaciers come into view on the east side of the mountain
they are broad rugged crevassed cloudlike masses of down-grinding ice
pouring forth streams of muddy water as measures of the work they are
doing in sculpturing the rocks beneath them very unlike the long
majestic glaciers of alaska that riverlike go winding down the valleys
through the forests to the sea these with a few others as yet
nameless are lingering remnants of once great glaciers that occupied
the canyons now taken by the rivers and in a few centuries will under
present conditions vanish altogether

the rivers of the granite south half of the sierra are outspread on
the peaks in a shining network of small branches that divide again
and again into small dribbling purling oozing threads drawing their
sources from the snow and ice of the surface they seldom sink out of
sight save here and there in the moraines or glaciers or early in the
season beneath the banks and bridges of snow soon to issue again
but in the north half laden with rent and porous lava small tributary
streams are rare and the rivers flowing for a time beneath the sky of
rock at length burst forth into the light in generous volume from
seams and caverns filtered cool and sparkling as if their bondage in
darkness safe from the vicissitudes of the weather in their youth were
only a blessing

only a very small portion of the water derived from the melting ice
and snow of shasta flows down its flanks on the surface probably
ninety-nine per cent of it is at once absorbed and drained away beneath
the porous lava-folds of the mountain to gush forth filtered and pure
in the form of immense springs so large some of them that they give
birth to rivers that start on their journey beneath the sun full-grown
and perfect without any childhood thus the shasta river issues from
a large lake-like spring in shasta valley and about two thirds of the
volume of the mccloud gushes forth in a grand spring on the east side of
the mountain a few miles back from its immediate base

to find the big spring of the mccloud or "mud glacier" which you will
know by its size (it being the largest on the east side) you make your
way through sunny parklike woods of yellow pine and a shaggy growth
of chaparral and come in a few hours to the river flowing in a gorge of
moderate depth cut abruptly down into the lava plain should the volume
of the stream where you strike it seem small then you will know that
you are above the spring if large nearly equal to its volume at its
confluence with the pitt river then you are below it and in either
case have only to follow the river up or down until you come to it

under certain conditions you may hear the roar of the water rushing from
the rock at a distance of half a mile or even more or you may not
hear it until within a few rods it comes in a grand eager gush from a
horizontal seam in the face of the wall of the river gorge in the form
of a partially interrupted sheet nearly seventy-five yards in width and
at a height above the riverbed of about forty feet as nearly as i could
make out without the means of exact measurement for about fifty yards
this flat current is in one unbroken sheet and flows in a lacework of
plashing upleaping spray over boulders that are clad in green silky
algae and water mosses to meet the smaller part of the river which
takes its rise farther up joining the river at right angles to its
course it at once swells its volume to three times its size above the
spring

the vivid green of the boulders beneath the water is very striking and
colors the entire stream with the exception of the portions broken into
foam the color is chiefly due to a species of algae which seems common
in springs of this sort that any kind of plant can hold on and grow
beneath the wear of so boisterous a current seems truly wonderful even
after taking into consideration the freedom of the water from cutting
drift and the constance of its volume and temperature throughout the
year the temperature is about 45 degrees and the height of the river
above the sea is here about three thousand feet asplenium epilobium
heuchera hazel dogwood and alder make a luxurious fringe and setting
and the forests of douglas spruce along the banks are the finest i have
ever seen in the sierra

from the spring you may go with the river a fine traveling
companion down to the sportsman's fishing station where if you are
getting hungry you may replenish your stores or bearing off around
the mountain by huckleberry valley complete your circuit without
interruption emerging at length from beneath the outspread arms of
the sugar pine at strawberry valley with all the new wealth and health
gathered in your walk not tired in the least and only eager to repeat
the round

tracing rivers to their fountains makes the most charming of travels
as the life-blood of the landscapes the best of the wilderness comes
to their banks and not one dull passage is found in all their eventful
histories tracing the mccloud to its highest springs and over the
divide to the fountains of fall river near fort crook thence down that
river to its confluence with the pitt on from there to the volcanic
region about lassen's butte through the big meadows among the sources
of the feather river and down through forests of sugar pine to the
fertile plains of chico this is a glorious saunter and imposes no
hardship food may be had at moderate intervals and the whole circuit
forms one ever-deepening broadening stream of enjoyment

fall river is a very remarkable stream it is only about ten miles
long and is composed of springs rapids and falls springs beautifully
shaded at one end of it a showy fall one hundred and eighty feet
high at the other and a rush of crystal rapids between the banks are
fringed with rubus rose plum cherry spiraea azalea honeysuckle
hawthorn ash alder elder aster goldenrod beautiful grasses
sedges rushes mosses and ferns with fronds as large as the leaves of
palms all in the midst of a richly forested landscape nowhere within
the limits of california are the forests of yellow pine so extensive and
exclusive as on the headwaters of the pitt they cover the mountains
and all the lower slopes that border the wide open valleys which abound
there pressing forward in imposing ranks seemingly the hardiest and
most firmly established of all the northern coniferae

the volcanic region about lassen's butte i have already in part
described miles of its flanks are dotted with hot springs many of them
so sulphurous and boisterous and noisy in their boiling that they seem
inclined to become geysers like those of the yellowstone

the ascent of lassen's butte is an easy walk and the views from the
summit are extremely telling innumerable lakes and craters surround the
base forests of the charming williamson spruce fringe lake and crater
alike the sunbeaten plains to east and west make a striking show and
the wilderness of peaks and ridges stretch indefinitely away on either
hand the lofty icy shasta towering high above all seems but an
hour's walk from you though the distance in an air-line is about sixty
miles

the "big meadows" lie near the foot of lassen's butte a beautiful
spacious basin set in the heart of the richly forested mountains
scarcely surpassed in the grandeur of its surroundings by tahoe during
the glacial period it was a mer de glace then a lake and now a level
meadow shining with bountiful springs and streams in the number and
size of its big spring fountains it excels even shasta one of the
largest that i measured forms a lakelet nearly a hundred yards in
diameter and in the generous flood it sends forth offers one of the
most telling symbols of nature's affluence to be found in the mountains

the great wilds of our country once held to be boundless and
inexhaustible are being rapidly invaded and overrun in every direction
and everything destructible in them is being destroyed how far
destruction may go it is not easy to guess every landscape low and
high seems doomed to be trampled and harried even the sky is not safe
from scath blurred and blackened whole summers together with the smoke
of fires that devour the woods

the shasta region is still a fresh unspoiled wilderness accessible and
available for travelers of every kind and degree would it not then be
a fine thing to set it apart like the yellowstone and yosemite as a
national park for the welfare and benefit of all mankind preserving
its fountains and forests and all its glad life in primeval beauty?
very little of the region can ever be more valuable for any other
use certainly not for gold nor for grain no private right or interest
need suffer and thousands yet unborn would come from far and near and
bless the country for its wise and benevolent forethought




vi the city of the saints [8]


the mountains rise grandly round about this curious city the zion of
the new saints so grandly that the city itself is hardly visible the
wahsatch range snow-laden and adorned with glacier-sculpted peaks
stretches continuously along the eastern horizon forming the boundary
of the great salt lake basin while across the valley of the jordan
southwestward from here you behold the oquirrh range about as snowy
and lofty as the wahsatch to the northwest your eye skims the blue
levels of the great lake out of the midst of which rise island
mountains and beyond at a distance of fifty miles is seen the
picturesque wall of the lakeside mountains blending with the lake and
the sky

the glacial developments of these superb ranges are sharply sculptured
peaks and crests with ample wombs between them where the ancient snows
of the glacial period were collected and transformed into ice and ranks
of profound shadowy canyons while moraines commensurate with the lofty
fountains extend into the valleys forming far the grandest series of
glacial monuments i have yet seen this side of the sierra

in beginning this letter i meant to describe the city but in the
company of these noble old mountains it is not easy to bend one's
attention upon anything else salt lake cannot be called a very
beautiful town neither is there anything ugly or repulsive about it
from the slopes of the wahsatch foothills or old lake benches toward
fort douglas it is seen to occupy the sloping gravelly delta of city
creek a fine hearty stream that comes pouring from the snows of the
mountains through a majestic glacial canyon and it is just where this
stream comes forth into the light on the edge of the valley of the
jordan that the mormons have built their new jerusalem

at first sight there is nothing very marked in the external appearance
of the town excepting its leafiness most of the houses are veiled with
trees as if set down in the midst of one grand orchard and seen at a
little distance they appear like a field of glacier boulders overgrown
with aspens such as one often meets in the upper valleys of the
california sierra for only the angular roofs are clearly visible

perhaps nineteen twentieths of the houses are built of bluish-gray adobe
bricks and are only one or two stories high forming fine cottage homes
which promise simple comfort within they are set well back from the
street leaving room for a flower garden while almost every one has a
thrifty orchard at the sides and around the back the gardens are
laid out with great simplicity indicating love for flowers by people
comparatively poor rather than deliberate efforts of the rich for showy
artistic effects they are like the pet gardens of children about as
artless and humble and harmonize with the low dwellings to which
they belong in almost every one you find daisies and mint and lilac
bushes and rows of plain english tulips lilacs and tulips are the
most characteristic flowers and nowhere have i seen them in greater
perfection as oakland is pre-eminently a city of roses so is this
mormon saints' rest a city of lilacs and tulips the flowers at least
are saintly and they are surely loved scarce a home however obscure
is without them and the simple unostentatious manner in which they are
planted and gathered in pots and boxes about the windows shows how truly
they are prized

the surrounding commons the marshy levels of the jordan and dry
gravelly lake benches on the slopes of the wahsatch foothills are now
gay with wild flowers chief among which are a species of phlox with an
abundance of rich pink corollas growing among sagebrush in showy
tufts and a beautiful papilionaceous plant with silky leaves and large
clusters of purple flowers banner wings and keel exquisitely shaded
a mertensia hydrophyllum white boragewort orthocarpus several
species of violets and a tall scarlet gilia it is delightful to see
how eagerly all these are sought after by the children both boys and
girls every day that i have gone botanizing i have met groups of little
latter-days with their precious bouquets and at such times it was hard
to believe the dark bloody passages of mormon history

but to return to the city as soon as city creek approaches its upper
limit its waters are drawn off right and left and distributed in brisk
rills one on each side of every street the regular slopes of the delta
upon which the city is built being admirably adapted to this system of
street irrigation these streams are all pure and sparkling in the
upper streets but as they are used to some extent as sewers they soon
manifest the consequence of contact with civilization though the speed
of their flow prevents their becoming offensive and little saints not
over particular may be seen drinking from them everywhere

the streets are remarkably wide and the buildings low making them
appear yet wider than they really are trees are planted along the
sidewalks elms poplars maples and a few catalpas and hawthorns yet
they are mostly small and irregular and nowhere form avenues half so
leafy and imposing as one would be led to expect even in the business
streets there is but little regularity in the buildings now a row
of plain adobe structures half store half dwelling then a high
mercantile block of red brick or sandstone and again a row of adobe
cottages nestled back among apple trees there is one immense store with
its sign upon the roof in letters big enough to be read miles away
"zcmi" (zion's co-operative mercantile institution) while many a
small codfishy corner grocery bears the legend "holiness to the lord
zcmi" but little evidence will you find in this zion with its
fifteen thousand souls of great wealth though many a saint is seeking
it as keenly as any yankee gentile but on the other hand searching
throughout all the city you will not find any trace of squalor or
extreme poverty

most of the women i have chanced to meet especially those from the
country have a weary repressed look as if for the sake of their
religion they were patiently carrying burdens heavier than they were
well able to bear but strange as it must seem to gentiles the
many wives of one man instead of being repelled from one another by
jealousy appear to be drawn all the closer together as if the real
marriage existed between the wives only groups of half a dozen or so
may frequently be seen on the streets in close conversation looking
as innocent and unspeculative as a lot of heifers while the masculine
saints pass them by as if they belonged to a distinct species in the
tabernacle last sunday one of the elders of the church in discoursing
upon the good things of life the possessions of latter-day saints
enumerated fruitful fields horses cows wives and implements the
wives being placed as above between the cows and implements without
receiving any superior emphasis

polygamy as far as i have observed exerts a more degrading influence
upon husbands that upon wives the love of the latter finds expression
in flowers and children while the former seem to be rendered incapable
of pure love of anything the spirit of mormonism is intensely exclusive
and un-american a more withdrawn compact sealed-up body of people
could hardly be found on the face of the earth than is gathered here
notwithstanding railroads telegraphs and the penetrating lights
that go sifting through society everywhere in this revolutionary
question-asking century most of the mormons i have met seem to be in a
state of perpetual apology which can hardly be fully accounted for by
gentile attacks at any rate it is unspeakably offensive to any free
man

"we saints" they are continually saying "are not as bad as we are
called we don't murder those who differ with us but rather treat them
with all charity you may go through our town night or day and no harm
shall befall you go into our houses and you will be well used we are
as glad as you are that lee was punished" etc while taking a saunter
the other evening we were overtaken by a characteristic mormon "an
umble man" who made us a very deferential salute and then walked on
with us about half a mile we discussed whatsoever of mormon doctrines
came to mind with american freedom which he defended as best he could
speaking in an excited but deprecating tone when hard pressed he would
say "i don't understand these deep things but the elders do i'm only
an umble tradesman" in taking leave he thanked us for the pleasure of
our querulous conversation removed his hat and bowed lowly in a sort
of uriah heep manner and then went to his humble home how many humble
wives it contained we did not learn

fine specimens of manhood are by no means wanting but the number of
people one meets here who have some physical defect or who attract one's
attention by some mental peculiarity that manifests itself through the
eyes is astonishingly great in so small a city it would evidently be
unfair to attribute these defects to mormonism though mormonism has
undoubtedly been the magnet that elected and drew these strange people
together from all parts of the world

but however "the peculiar doctrines" and "peculiar practices" of
mormonism have affected the bodies and the minds of the old saints the
little latter-day boys and girls are as happy and natural as possible
running wild with plenty of good hearty parental indulgence playing
fighting gathering flowers in delightful innocence and when we
consider that most of the parents have been drawn from the thickly
settled portion of the old world where they have long suffered the
repression of hunger and hard toil the mormon children "utah's best
crop" seem remarkably bright and promising

from children one passes naturally into the blooming wilderness to the
pure religion of sunshine and snow where all the good and the evil of
this strange people lifts and vanishes from the mind like mist from the
mountains




vii a great storm in utah [9]


utah has just been blessed with one of the grandest storms i have ever
beheld this side of the sierra the mountains are laden with fresh snow
wild streams are swelling and booming adown the canyons and out in the
valley of the jordan a thousand rain-pools are gleaming in the sun

with reference to the development of fertile storms bearing snow and
rain the greater portion of the calendar springtime of utah has been
winter in all the upper canyons of the mountains the snow is now from
five to ten feet deep or more and most of it has fallen since march
almost every other day during the last three weeks small local storms
have been falling on the wahsatch and oquirrh mountains while the
jordan valley remained dry and sun-filled but on the afternoon of
thursday the 17th ultimo wind rain and snow filled the whole basin
driving wildly over valley and plain from range to range bestowing
their benefactions in most cordial and harmonious storm-measures the
oldest saints say they have never witnessed a more violent storm of this
kind since the first settlement of zion and while the gale from the
northwest with which the storm began was rocking their adobe walls
uprooting trees and darkening the streets with billows of dust and sand
some of them seemed inclined to guess that the terrible phenomenon was
one of the signs of the times of which their preachers are so constantly
reminding them the beginning of the outpouring of the treasured wrath
of the lord upon the gentiles for the killing of joseph smith to me it
seemed a cordial outpouring of nature's love but it is easy to differ
with salt latter-days in everything storms wives politics and
religion

about an hour before the storm reached the city i was so fortunate as
to be out with a friend on the banks of the jordan enjoying the scenery
clouds with peculiarly restless and self-conscious gestures were
marshaling themselves along the mountain-tops and sending out long
overlapping wings across the valley and even where no cloud was
visible an obscuring film absorbed the sunlight giving rise to a cold
bluish darkness nevertheless distant objects along the boundaries of
the landscape were revealed with wonderful distinctness in this weird
subdued cloud-sifted light the mountains in particular with the
forests on their flanks their mazy lacelike canyons the wombs of the
ancient glaciers and their marvelous profusion of ornate sculpture
were most impressively manifest one would fancy that a man might be
clearly seen walking on the snow at a distance of twenty or thirty
miles

while we were reveling in this rare ungarish grandeur turning from
range to range studying the darkening sky and listening to the still
small voices of the flowers at our feet some of the denser clouds came
down crowning and wreathing the highest peaks and dropping long gray
fringes whose smooth linear structure showed that snow was beginning to
fall of these partial storms there were soon ten or twelve arranged
in two rows while the main jordan valley between them lay as yet in
profound calm at 430 pm a dark brownish cloud appeared close down on
the plain towards the lake extending from the northern extremity of
the oquirrh range in a northeasterly direction as far as the eye could
reach its peculiar color and structure excited our attention without
enabling us to decide certainly as to its character but we were not
left long in doubt for in a few minutes it came sweeping over the
valley in a wild uproar a torrent of wind thick with sand and dust
advancing with a most majestic front rolling and overcombing like a
gigantic sea-wave scarcely was it in plain sight ere it was upon
us racing across the jordan over the city and up the slopes of the
wahsatch eclipsing all the landscapes in its course the bending trees
the dust streamers and the wild onrush of everything movable giving it
an appreciable visibility that rendered it grand and inspiring

this gale portion of the storm lasted over an hour then down came the
blessed rain and the snow all through the night and the next day the
snow and rain alternating and blending in the valley it is long since
i have seen snow coming into a city the crystal flakes falling in the
foul streets was a pitiful sight

notwithstanding the vaunted refining influences of towns purity of all
kinds pure hearts pure streams pure snow must here be exposed to
terrible trials city creek coming from its high glacial fountains
enters the streets of this mormon zion pure as an angel but how does it
leave it? even roses and lilies in gardens most loved are tainted with a
thousand impurities as soon as they unfold i heard brigham young in the
tabernacle the other day warning his people that if they did not mend
their manners angels would not come into their houses though perchance
they might be sauntering by with little else to do than chat with them
possibly there may be salt lake families sufficiently pure for angel
society but i was not pleased with the reception they gave the small
snow angels that god sent among them the other night only the children
hailed them with delight the old latter-days seemed to shun them i
should like to see how mr young the lake prophet would meet such
messengers

but to return to the storm toward the evening of the 18th it began to
wither the snowy skirts of the wahsatch mountains appeared beneath the
lifting fringes of the clouds and the sun shone out through colored
windows producing one of the most glorious after-storm effects i ever
witnessed looking across the jordan the gray sagey slopes from the
base of the oquirrh mountains were covered with a thick plushy cloth of
gold soft and ethereal as a cloud not merely tinted and gilded like a
rock with autumn sunshine but deeply muffled beyond recognition surely
nothing in heaven nor any mansion of the lord in all his worlds could
be more gloriously carpeted other portions of the plain were flushed
with red and purple and all the mountains and the clouds above them
were painted in corresponding loveliness earth and sky round and round
the entire landscape was one ravishing revelation of color infinitely
varied and interblended

i have seen many a glorious sunset beneath lifting storm clouds on the
mountains but nothing comparable with this i felt as if new-arrived in
some other far-off world the mountains the plains the sky all seemed
new other experiences seemed but to have prepared me for this as souls
are prepared for heaven to describe the colors on a single mountain
would if it were possible at all require many a volume purples and
yellows and delicious pearly grays divinely toned and interblended
and so richly put on one seemed to be looking down through the ground
as through a sky the disbanding clouds lingered lovingly about the
mountains filling the canyons like tinted wool rising and drooping
around the topmost peaks fondling their rugged bases or sailing
alongside trailed their lustrous fringes through the pines as if taking
a last view of their accomplished work then came darkness and the
glorious day was done

this afternoon the utah mountains and valleys seem to belong to our own
very world again they are covered with common sunshine down here on
the banks of the jordan larks and redwings are swinging on the rushes
the balmy air is instinct with immortal life the wild flowers the
grass and the farmers' grain are fresh as if like the snow they had
come out of heaven and the last of the angel clouds are fleeing from
the mountains




viii bathing in salt lake [10]


when the north wind blows bathing in salt lake is a glorious baptism
for then it is all wildly awake with waves blooming like a prairie in
snowy crystal foam plunging confidently into the midst of the grand
uproar you are hugged and welcomed and swim without effort rocking
and heaving up and down in delightful rhythm while the winds sing in
chorus and the cool fragrant brine searches every fiber of your body
and at length you are tossed ashore with a glad godspeed braced and
salted and clean as a saint

the nearest point on the shoreline is distant about ten miles from salt
lake city and is almost inaccessible on account of the boggy character
of the ground but by taking the western utah railroad at a distance
of twenty miles you reach what is called lake point where the shore is
gravelly and wholesome and abounds in fine retreating bays that seem to
have been made on purpose for bathing here the northern peaks of
the oquirrh range plant their feet in the clear blue brine with
fine curbing insteps leaving no space for muddy levels the crystal
brightness of the water the wild flowers and the lovely mountain
scenery make this a favorite summer resort for pleasure and health
seekers numerous excursion trains are run from the city and parties
some of them numbering upwards of a thousand come to bathe and dance
and roam the flowery hillsides together

but at the time of my first visit in may i fortunately found myself
alone the hotel and bathhouse which form the chief improvements of the
place were sleeping in winter silence notwithstanding the year was in
full bloom it was one of those genial sun-days when flowers and flies
come thronging to the light and birds sing their best the mountain
ranges stretching majestically north and south were piled with pearly
cumuli the sky overhead was pure azure and the wind-swept lake was all
aroll and aroar with whitecaps

i sauntered along the shore until i came to a sequestered cove where
buttercups and wild peas were blooming close down to the limit reached
by the waves here i thought is just the place for a bath but the
breakers seemed terribly boisterous and forbidding as they came rolling
up the beach or dashed white against the rocks that bounded the cove
on the east the outer ranks ever broken ever builded formed a
magnificent rampart sculptured and corniced like the hanging wall of a
bergschrund and appeared hopelessly insurmountable however easily one
might ride the swelling waves beyond i feasted awhile on their beauty
watching their coming in from afar like faithful messengers to tell
their stories one by one then i turned reluctantly away to botanize
and wait a calm but the calm did not come that day nor did i wait
long in an hour or two i was back again to the same little cove the
waves still sang the old storm song and rose in high crystal walls
seemingly hard enough to be cut in sections like ice

without any definite determination i found myself undressed as if some
one else had taken me in hand and while one of the largest waves was
ringing out its message and spending itself on the beach i ran out with
open arms to the next ducked beneath its breaking top and got myself
into right lusty relationship with the brave old lake away i sped in
free glad motion as if like a fish i had been afloat all my life
now low out of sight in the smooth glassy valleys now bounding aloft
on firm combing crests while the crystal foam beat against my breast
with keen crisp clashing as if composed of pure salt i bowed to every
wave and each lifted me right royally to its shoulders almost setting
me erect on my feet while they all went speeding by like living
creatures blooming and rejoicing in the brightness of the day and
chanting the history of their grand mountain home

a good deal of nonsense has been written concerning the difficulty of
swimming in this heavy water "one's head would go down and heels come
up and the acrid brine would burn like fire" i was conscious only of
a joyous exhilaration my limbs seemingly heeding their own business
without any discomfort or confusion so much so that without previous
knowledge my experience on this occasion would not have led me to detect
anything peculiar in calm weather however the sustaining power of the
water might probably be more marked this was by far the most exciting
and effective wave excursion i ever made this side of the rocky
mountains and when at its close i was heaved ashore among the sunny
grasses and flowers i found myself a new creature indeed and went
bounding along the beach with blood all aglow reinforced by the best
salts of the mountains and ready for any race

since the completion of the transcontinental and utah railways this
magnificent lake in the heart of the continent has become as accessible
as any watering-place on either coast and i am sure that thousands of
travelers sick and well would throng its shores every summer were its
merits but half known lake point is only an hour or two from the city
and has hotel accommodations and a steamboat for excursions and then
besides the bracing waters the climate is delightful the mountains
rise into the cool sky furrowed with canyons almost yosemitic in
grandeur and filled with a glorious profusion of flowers and trees
lovers of science lovers of wildness lovers of pure rest will find
here more than they may hope for

as for the mormons one meets however their doctrines be regarded they
will be found as rich in human kindness as any people in all our broad
land while the dark memories that cloud their earlier history will
vanish from the mind as completely as when we bathe in the fountain
azure of the sierra




ix mormon lilies [11]


lilies are rare in utah so also are their companions the ferns and
orchids chiefly on account of the fiery saltness of the soil and
climate you may walk the deserts of the great basin in the bloom time
of the year all the way across from the snowy sierra to the snowy
wahsatch and your eyes will be filled with many a gay malva and poppy
and abronia and cactus but you may not see a single true lily and
only a very few liliaceous plants of any kind not even in the cool
fresh glens of the mountains will you find these favorite flowers
though some of these desert ranges almost rival the sierra in height
nevertheless in the building and planting of this grand territory the
lilies were not forgotten far back in the dim geologic ages when the
sediments of the old seas were being gathered and outspread in smooth
sheets like leaves of a book and when these sediments became dry land
and were baked and crumbled into the sky as mountain ranges when the
lava-floods of the fire period were being lavishly poured forth from
innumerable rifts and craters when the ice of the glacial period was
laid like a mantle over every mountain and valley throughout all
these immensely protracted periods in the throng of these majestic
operations nature kept her flower children in mind she considered
the lilies and while planting the plains with sage and the hills with
cedar she has covered at least one mountain with golden erythroniums
and fritillarias as its crowning glory as if willing to show what she
could do in the lily line even here

looking southward from the south end of salt lake the two northmost
peaks of the oquirrh range are seen swelling calmly into the cool sky
without any marked character excepting only their snow crowns and a
few weedy-looking patches of spruce and fir the simplicity of their
slopes preventing their real loftiness from being appreciated gray
sagey plains circle around their bases and up to a height of a thousand
feet or more their sides are tinged with purple which i afterwards
found is produced by a close growth of dwarf oak just coming into leaf
higher you may detect faint tintings of green on a gray ground from
young grasses and sedges then come the dark pine woods filling glacial
hollows and over all the smooth crown of snow

while standing at their feet the other day shortly after my memorable
excursion among the salt waves of the lake i said "now i shall have
another baptism i will bathe in the high sky among cool wind-waves
from the snow" from the more southerly of the two peaks a long ridge
comes down bent like a bow one end in the hot plains the other in
the snow of the summit after carefully scanning the jagged towers and
battlements with which it is roughened i determined to make it my way
though it presented but a feeble advertisement of its floral wealth
this apparent barrenness however made no great objection just then
for i was scarce hoping for flowers old or new or even for fine
scenery i wanted in particular to learn what the oquirrh rocks were
made of what trees composed the curious patches of forest and perhaps
more than all i was animated by a mountaineer's eagerness to get my
feet into the snow once more and my head into the clear sky after
lying dormant all winter at the level of the sea

but in every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks i had
not gone more than a mile from lake point ere i found the way profusely
decked with flowers mostly compositae and purple leguminosae a hundred
corollas or more to the square yard with a corresponding abundance of
winged blossoms above them moths and butterflies the leguminosae
of the insect kingdom this floweriness is maintained with delightful
variety all the way up through rocks and bushes to the snow violets
lilies gilias oenotheras wallflowers ivesias saxifrages smilax
and miles of blooming bushes chiefly azalea honeysuckle brier rose
buckthorn and eriogonum all meeting and blending in divine accord

two liliaceous plants in particular erythronium grandiflorum and
fritillaria pudica are marvelously beautiful and abundant never
before in all my walks have i met so glorious a throng of these fine
showy liliaceous plants the whole mountainside was aglow with them
from a height of fifty-five hundred feet to the very edge of the snow
although remarkably fragile both in form and in substance they are
endowed with plenty of deep-seated vitality enabling them to grow in
all kinds of places down in leafy glens in the lee of wind-beaten
ledges and beneath the brushy tangles of azalea and oak and prickly
roses everywhere forming the crowning glory of the flowers if the
neighboring mountains are as rich in lilies then this may well be
called the lily range

after climbing about a thousand feet above the plain i came to a
picturesque mass of rock cropping up through the underbrush on one of
the steepest slopes of the mountain after examining some tufts of grass
and saxifrage that were growing in its fissured surface i was going
to pass it by on the upper side where the bushes were more open but a
company composed of the two lilies i have mentioned were blooming on the
lower side and though they were as yet out of sight i suddenly changed
my mind and went down to meet them as if attracted by the ringing of
their bells they were growing in a small nestlike opening between the
rock and the bushes and both the erythronium and the fritillaria were
in full flower these were the first of the species i had seen and
i need not try to tell the joy they made they are both lowly
plants lowly as violets the tallest seldom exceeding six inches in
height so that the most searching winds that sweep the mountains scarce
reach low enough to shake their bells

the fritillaria has five or six linear obtuse leaves put on
irregularly near the bottom of the stem which is usually terminated
by one large bell-shaped flower but its more beautiful companion the
erythronium has two radical leaves only which are large and oval and
shine like glass they extend horizontally in opposite directions and
form a beautiful glossy ground over which the one large down-looking
flower is swung from a simple stem the petals being strongly recurved
like those of lilium superbum occasionally a specimen is met which
has from two to five flowers hung in a loose panicle people oftentimes
travel far to see curious plants like the carnivorous darlingtonia the
fly-catcher the walking fern etc i hardly know how the little bells
i have been describing would be regarded by seekers of this class but
every true flower-lover who comes to consider these utah lilies will
surely be well rewarded however long the way

pushing on up the rugged slopes i found many delightful
seclusions moist nooks at the foot of cliffs and lilies in every one
of them not growing close together like daisies but well apart with
plenty of room for their bells to swing free and ring i found hundreds
of them in full bloom within two feet of the snow in winter only the
bulbs are alive sleeping deep beneath the ground like field mice in
their nests then the snow-flowers fall above them lilies over lilies
until the spring winds blow and these winter lilies wither in turn
then the hiding erythroniums and fritillarias rise again responsive to
the first touches of the sun

i noticed the tracks of deer in many places among the lily gardens and
at the height of about seven thousand feet i came upon the fresh trail
of a flock of wild sheep showing that these fine mountaineers still
flourish here above the range of mormon rifles in the planting of
her wild gardens nature takes the feet and teeth of her flocks into
account and makes use of them to trim and cultivate and keep them in
order as the bark and buds of the tree are tended by woodpeckers and
linnets

the evergreen woods consist as far as i observed of two species
a spruce and a fir standing close together erect and arrowy in a
thrifty compact growth but they are quite small say from six to
twelve or fourteen inches in diameter and bout forty feet in height
among their giant relatives of the sierra the very largest would seem
mere saplings a considerable portion of the south side of the mountain
is planted with a species of aspen called "quaking asp" by the
wood-choppers it seems to be quite abundant on many of the eastern
mountains of the basin and forms a marked feature of their upper
forests

wading up the curves of the summit was rather toilsome for the snow
which was softened by the blazing sun was from ten to twenty feet deep
but the view was one of the most impressively sublime i ever beheld
snowy ice-sculptured ranges bounded the horizon all around while the
great lake eighty miles long and fifty miles wide lay fully revealed
beneath a lily sky the shorelines marked by a ribbon of white sand
were seen sweeping around many a bay and promontory in elegant curves
and picturesque islands rising to mountain heights and some of them
capped with pearly cumuli and the wide prairie of water glowing in the
gold and purple of evening presented all the colors that tint the lips
of shells and the petals of lilies the most beautiful lake this side
of the rocky mountains utah lake lying thirty-five miles to the
south was in full sight also and the river jordan which links the two
together may be traced in silvery gleams throughout its whole course

descending the mountain i followed the windings of the main central
glen on the north gathering specimens of the cones and sprays of the
evergreens and most of the other new plants i had met but the lilies
formed the crowning glory of my bouquet the grandest i had carried in
many a day i reached the hotel on the lake about dusk with all my fresh
riches and my first mountain ramble in utah was accomplished on my way
back to the city the next day i met a grave old mormon with whom i had
previously held some latter-day discussions i shook my big handful of
lilies in his face and shouted "here are the true saints ancient
and latter-day enduring forever" after he had recovered from his
astonishment he said "they are nice"

the other liliaceous plants i have met in utah are two species of
zigadenas fritillaria atropurpurea calochortus nuttallii and three
or four handsome alliums one of these lilies the calochortus several
species of which are well known in california as the "mariposa tulips"
has received great consideration at the hands of the mormons for to it
hundreds of them owe their lives during the famine years between
1853 and 1858 great destitution prevailed especially in the southern
settlements on account of drouth and grasshoppers and throughout one
hungry winter in particular thousands of the people subsisted chiefly
on the bulbs of the tulips called "sego" by the indians who taught
them its use

liliaceous women and girls are rare among the mormons they have seen
too much hard repressive toil to admit of the development of lily
beauty either in form or color in general they are thickset with large
feet and hands and with sun-browned faces often curiously freckled
like the petals of fritillaria atropurpurea they are fruit rather than
flower good brown bread but down in the san pitch valley at gunnison
i discovered a genuine lily happily named lily young she is a
granddaughter of brigham young slender and graceful with lily-white
cheeks tinted with clear rose she was brought up in the old salt lake
zion house but by some strange chance has been transplanted to this
wilderness where she blooms alone the "lily of san pitch" pitch is an
old indian who i suppose pitched into the settlers and thus acquired
fame enough to give name to the valley here i feel uneasy about the
name of this lily for the compositors have a perverse trick of making
me say all kinds of absurd things wholly unwarranted by plain copy and
i fear that the "lily of san pitch" will appear in print as the widow of
sam patch but however this may be among my memories of this strange
land that oquirrh mountain with its golden lilies will ever rise in
clear relief and associated with them will always be the mormon lily of
san pitch




x the san gabriel valley [12]


the sun valley of san gabriel is one of the brightest spots to be found
in all our bright land and most of its brightness is wildness wild
south sunshine in a basin rimmed about with mountains and hills
cultivation is not wholly wanting for here are the choices of all the
los angeles orange groves but its glorious abundance of ripe sun and
soil is only beginning to be coined into fruit the drowsy bits of
cultivation accomplished by the old missionaries and the more recent
efforts of restless americans are scarce as yet visible and when
comprehended in general views form nothing more than mere freckles on
the smooth brown bosom of the valley

i entered the sunny south half a month ago coming down along the cool
sea and landing at santa monica an hour's ride over stretches of bare
brown plain and through cornfields and orange groves brought me to the
handsome conceited little town of los angeles where one finds spanish
adobes and yankee shingles meeting and overlapping in very curious
antagonism i believe there are some fifteen thousand people here and
some of their buildings are rather fine but the gardens and the sky
interested me more a palm is seen here and there poising its royal
crown in the rich light and the banana with its magnificent ribbon
leaves producing a marked tropical effect not semi-tropical as they
are so fond of saying here while speaking of their fruits nothing
i have noticed strikes me as semi save the brusque little bits
of civilization with which the wilderness is checkered these are
semi-barbarous or less everything else in the region has a most
exuberant pronounced wholeness the city held me but a short time for
the san gabriel mountains were in sight advertising themselves grandly
along the northern sky and i was eager to make my way into their midst

at pasadena i had the rare good fortune to meet my old friend doctor
congar with whom i had studied chemistry and mathematics fifteen years
ago he exalted san gabriel above all other inhabitable valleys old and
new on the face of the globe "i have rambled" said he "ever since
we left college tasting innumerable climates and trying the advantages
offered by nearly every new state and territory here i have made my
home and here i shall stay while i live the geographical position is
exactly right soil and climate perfect and everything that heart can
wish comes to our efforts flowers fruits milk and honey and plenty
of money and there" he continued pointing just beyond his own
precious possessions "is a block of land that is for sale buy it and
be my neighbor plant five acres with orange trees and by the time your
last mountain is climbed their fruit will be your fortune" he then led
my down the valley through the few famous old groves in full bearing
and on the estate of mr wilson showed me a ten-acre grove eighteen
years old the last year's crop from which was sold for twenty thousand
dollars "there" said he with triumphant enthusiasm "what do you
think of that? two thousand dollars per acre per annum for land worth
only one hundred dollars"

the number of orange trees planted to the acre is usually from
forty-nine to sixty-nine they then stand from twenty-five to thirty
feet apart each way and thus planted thrive and continue fruitful to
a comparatively great age j debarth shorb an enthusiastic believer
in los angeles and oranges says "we have trees on our property
fully forty years old and eighteen inches in diameter that are still
vigorous and yielding immense crops of fruit although they are only
twenty feet apart" seedlings are said to begin to bear remunerative
crops in their tenth year but by superior cultivation this long
unproductive period my be somewhat lessened while trees from three
to five years old may be purchased from the nurserymen so that the
newcomer who sets out an orchard may begin to gather fruit by the fifth
or sixth year when first set out and for some years afterward the
trees are irrigated by making rings of earth around them which are
connected with small ditches through which the water is distributed to
each tree or where the ground is nearly level the whole surface is
flooded from time to time as required from 309 trees twelve years old
from the seed debarth shorb says that in the season of 1874 he obtained
an average of $2050 per tree or $1435 per acre over and above the
cost of transportation to san francisco commission on sales etc he
considers $1000 per acre a fair average at present prices after the
trees have reached the age of twelve years the average price throughout
the county for the last five years has been about $20 or $25 per
thousand and inasmuch as the area adapted to orange culture is
limited it is hoped that this price may not greatly fall for many
years

the lemon and lime are also cultivated here to some extent and
considerable attention is now being given to the florida banana and
the olive almond and english walnut but the orange interest heavily
overshadows every other while vines have of late years been so
unremunerative they are seldom mentioned

this is pre-eminently a fruit land but the fame of its productions
has in some way far outrun the results that have as yet been attained
experiments have been tried and good beginnings made but the number
of really valuable well-established groves is scarce as one to fifty
compared with the newly planted many causes however have combined
of late to give the business a wonderful impetus and new orchards are
being made every day while the few old groves aglow with golden fruit
are the burning and shining lights that direct and energize the sanguine
newcomers

after witnessing the bad effect of homelessness developed to so
destructive an extent in california it would reassure every lover of
his race to see the hearty home-building going on here and the blessed
contentment that naturally follows it travel-worn pioneers who have
been tossed about like boulders in flood time are thronging hither as
to a kind of a terrestrial heaven resolved to rest they build and
plant and settle and so come under natural influences when a man
plants a tree he plants himself every root is an anchor over which he
rests with grateful interest and becomes sufficiently calm to feel the
joy of living he necessarily makes the acquaintance of the sun and
the sky favorite trees fill his mind and while tending them like
children and accepting the benefits they bring he becomes himself a
benefactor he sees down through the brown common ground teeming with
colored fruits as if it were transparent and learns to bring them to
the surface what he wills he can raise by true enchantment with slips
and rootlets his magic wands they appear at his bidding these and
the seeds he plants are his prayers and by them brought into right
relations with god he works grander miracles every day than ever were
written

the pasadena colony located on the southwest corner of the well-known
san pasqual rancho is scarce three years old but it is growing
rapidly like a pet tree and already forms one of the best
contributions to culture yet accomplished in the county it now numbers
about sixty families mostly drawn from the better class of vagabond
pioneers who during their rolling-stone days have managed to gather
sufficient gold moss to purchase from ten to forty acres of land they
are perfectly hilarious in their newly found life work like ants in a
sunny noonday and looking far into the future hopefully count their
orange chicks ten years or more before they are hatched supporting
themselves in the meantime on the produce of a few acres of alfalfa
together with garden vegetables and the quick-growing fruits such
as figs grapes apples etc the whole reinforced by the remaining
dollars of their land purchase money there is nothing more remarkable
in the character of the colony than the literary and scientific taste
displayed the conversation of most i have met here is seasoned with a
smack of mental ozone attic salt which struck me as being rare among
the tillers of california soil people of taste and money in search of a
home would do well to prospect the resources of this aristocratic little
colony

if we look now at these southern valleys in general it will appear at
once that with all their advantages they lie beyond the reach of poor
settlers not only on account of the high price of irrigable land one
hundred dollars per acre and upwards but because of the scarcity of
labor a settler with three or four thousand dollars would be penniless
after paying for twenty acres of orange land and building ever so plain
a house while many years would go by ere his trees yielded an income
adequate to the maintenance of his family

nor is there anything sufficiently reviving in the fine climate to form
a reliable inducement for very sick people most of this class from
all i can learn come here only to die and surely it is better to die
comfortably at home avoiding the thousand discomforts of travel at a
time when they are so heard to bear it is indeed pitiful to see so many
invalids already on the verge of the grave making a painful way
to quack climates hoping to change age to youth and the darkening
twilight of their day to morning no such health-fountain has been
found and this climate fine as it is seems like most others to be
adapted for well people only from all i could find out regarding its
influence upon patients suffering from pulmonary difficulties it is
seldom beneficial to any great extent in advanced cases the cold sea
winds are less fatal to this class of sufferers than the corresponding
winds further north but notwithstanding they are tempered on their
passage inland over warm dry ground they are still more or less
injurious

the summer climate of the fir and pine woods of the sierra nevada would
i think be found infinitely more reviving but because these woods
have not been advertised like patent medicines few seem to think of the
spicy vivifying influences that pervade their fountain freshness and
beauty




xi the san gabriel mountains [13]


after saying so much for human culture in my last perhaps i may now be
allowed a word for wildness the wildness of this southland pure and
untamable as the sea

in the mountains of san gabriel overlooking the lowland vines and fruit
groves mother nature is most ruggedly thornily savage not even in
the sierra have i ever made the acquaintance of mountains more rigidly
inaccessible the slopes are exceptionally steep and insecure to the
foot of the explorer however great his strength or skill may be but
thorny chaparral constitutes their chief defense with the exception
of little park and garden spots not visible in comprehensive views the
entire surface is covered with it from the highest peaks to the plain
it swoops into every hollow and swells over every ridge gracefully
complying with the varied topography in shaggy ungovernable
exuberance fairly dwarfing the utmost efforts of human culture out of
sight and mind

but in the very heart of this thorny wilderness down in the dells you
may find gardens filled with the fairest flowers that any child would
love and unapproachable linns lined with lilies and ferns where the
ousel builds its mossy hut and sings in chorus with the white falling
water bears also and panthers wolves wildcats wood rats
squirrels foxes snakes and innumerable birds all find grateful homes
here adding wildness to wildness in glorious profusion and variety

where the coast ranges and the sierra nevada come together we find a
very complicated system of short ranges the geology and topography of
which is yet hidden and many years of laborious study must be given for
anything like a complete interpretation of them the san gabriel is one
or more of these ranges forty or fifty miles long and half as broad
extending from the cajon pass on the east to the santa monica and santa
susanna ranges on the west san antonio the dominating peak rises
towards the eastern extremity of the range to a height of about six
thousand feet forming a sure landmark throughout the valley and all
the way down to the coast without however possessing much striking
individuality the whole range seen from the plain with the hot sun
beating upon its southern slopes wears a terribly forbidding aspect
there is nothing of the grandeur of snow or glaciers or deep forests
to excite curiosity or adventure no trace of gardens or waterfalls
from base to summit all seems gray barren silent dead bleached bones
of mountains overgrown with scrubby bushes like gray moss but all
mountains are full of hidden beauty and the next day after my arrival
at pasadena i supplied myself with bread and eagerly set out to give
myself to their keeping

on the first day of my excursion i went only as far as the mouth of
eaton canyon because the heat was oppressive and a pair of new shoes
were chafing my feet to such an extent that walking began to be painful
while looking for a camping ground among the boulder beds of the canyon
i came upon a strange dark man of doubtful parentage he kindly invited
me to camp with him and led me to his little hut all my conjectures as
to his nationality failed and no wonder since his father was irish and
mother spanish a mixture not often met even in california he happened
to be out of candles so we sat in the dark while he gave me a sketch of
his life which was exceedingly picturesque then he showed me his plans
for the future he was going to settle among these canyon boulders and
make money and marry a spanish woman people mine for irrigating water
along the foothills as for gold he is now driving a prospecting tunnel
into a spur of the mountains back of his cabin "my prospect is good"
he said "and if i strike a strong flow i shall soon be worth five or
ten thousand dollars that flat out there" he continued referring to a
small irregular patch of gravelly detritus that had been sorted out and
deposited by eaton creek during some flood season "is large enough for
a nice orange grove and after watering my own trees i can sell water
down the valley and then the hillside back of the cabin will do for
vines and i can keep bees for the white sage and black sage up the
mountains is full of honey you see i've got a good thing" all this
prospective affluence in the sunken boulder-choked flood-bed of eaton
creek most home-seekers would as soon think of settling on the summit
of san antonio

half an hour's easy rambling up the canyon brought me to the foot of
"the fall" famous throughout the valley settlements as the finest yet
discovered in the range it is a charming little thing with a voice
sweet as a songbird's leaping some thirty-five or forty feet into a
round mirror pool the cliff back of it and on both sides is completely
covered with thick furry mosses and the white fall shines against the
green like a silver instrument in a velvet case here come the gabriel
lads and lassies from the commonplace orange groves to make love and
gather ferns and dabble away their hot holidays in the cool pool they
are fortunate in finding so fresh a retreat so near their homes it is
the yosemite of san gabriel the walls though not of the true yosemite
type either in form or sculpture rise to a height of nearly two
thousand feet ferns are abundant on all the rocks within reach of the
spray and picturesque maples and sycamores spread a grateful shade over
a rich profusion of wild flowers that grow among the boulders from the
edge of the pool a mile or more down the dell-like bottom of the valley
the whole forming a charming little poem of wildness the vestibule of
these shaggy mountain temples

the foot of the fall is about a thousand feet above the level of the
sea and here climbing begins i made my way out of the valley on the
west side followed the ridge that forms the western rim of the eaton
basin to the summit of one of the principal peaks thence crossed the
middle of the basin forcing a way over its many subordinate ridges and
out over the eastern rim and from first to last during three days
spent in this excursion i had to contend with the richest most
self-possessed and uncompromising chaparral i have ever enjoyed since
first my mountaineering began

for a hundred feet or so the ascent was practicable only by means of
bosses of the club moss that clings to the rock above this the ridge
is weathered away to a slender knife-edge for a distance of two or
three hundred yards and thence to the summit it is a bristly mane of
chaparral here and there small openings occur commanding grand views
of the valley and beyond to the ocean these are favorite outlooks and
resting places for bears wolves and wildcats in the densest places i
came upon woodrat villages whose huts were from four to eight feet high
built in the same style of architecture as those of the muskrats

the day was nearly done i reached the summit and i had time to make
only a hasty survey of the topography of the wild basin now outspread
maplike beneath and to drink in the rare loveliness of the sunlight
before hastening down in search of water pushing through another mile
of chaparral i emerged into one of the most beautiful parklike groves
of live oak i ever saw the ground beneath was planted only with
aspidiums and brier roses at the foot of the grove i came to the dry
channel of one of the tributary streams but following it down a short
distance i descried a few specimens of the scarlet mimulus and i was
assured that water was near i found about a bucketful in a granite
bowl but it was full of leaves and beetles making a sort of brown
coffee that could be rendered available only by filtering it through
sand and charcoal this i resolved to do in case the night came on
before i found better following the channel a mile farther down to
its confluence with another larger tributary i found a lot of boulder
pools clear as crystal and brimming full linked together by little
glistening currents just strong enough to sing flowers in full bloom
adorned the banks lilies ten feet high and luxuriant ferns arching
over one another in lavish abundance while a noble old live oak spread
its rugged boughs over all forming one of the most perfect and most
secluded of nature's gardens here i camped making my bed on smooth
cobblestones

next morning pushing up the channel of a tributary that takes its rise
on mount san antonio i passed many lovely gardens watered by oozing
currentlets every one of which had lilies in them in the full pomp of
bloom and a rich growth of ferns chiefly woodwardias and aspidiums and
maidenhairs but toward the base of the mountain the channel was dry
and the chaparral closed over from bank to bank so that i was compelled
to creep more than a mile on hands and knees

in one spot i found an opening in the thorny sky where i could stand
erect and on the further side of the opening discovered a small pool
"now here" i said "i must be careful in creeping for the birds of
the neighborhood come here to drink and the rattlesnakes come here
to catch them" i then began to cast my eye along the channel perhaps
instinctively feeling a snaky atmosphere and finally discovered one
rattler between my feet but there was a bashful look in his eye and a
withdrawing deprecating kink in his neck that showed plainly as words
could tell that he would not strike and only wished to be let alone
i therefore passed on lifting my foot a little higher than usual and
left him to enjoy his life in this his own home

my next camp was near the heart of the basin at the head of a grand
system of cascades from ten to two hundred feet high one following the
other in close succession and making a total descent of nearly seventeen
hundred feet the rocks above me leaned over in a threatening way
and were full of seams making the camp a very unsafe one during an
earthquake

next day the chaparral in ascending the eastern rim of the basin was
if possible denser and more stubbornly bayoneted than ever i followed
bear trails where in some places i found tufts of their hair that had
been pulled out in squeezing a way through but there was much of a very
interesting character that far overpaid all my pains most of the plants
are identical with those of the sierra but there are quite a number of
mexican species one coniferous tree was all i found this is a spruce
of a species new to me douglasii macrocarpa [14]

my last camp was down at the narrow notched bottom of a dry channel
the only open way for the life in the neighborhood i therefore lay
between two fires built to fence out snakes and wolves

from the summit of the eastern rim i had a glorious view of the valley
out to the ocean which would require a whole book for its description
my bread gave out a day before reaching the settlements but i felt all
the fresher and clearer for the fast




xii nevada farms [15]


to the farmer who comes to this thirsty land from beneath rainy skies
nevada seems one vast desert all sage and sand hopelessly irredeemable
now and forever and this under present conditions is severely
true for notwithstanding it has gardens grainfields and hayfields
generously productive these compared with the arid stretches of valley
and plain as beheld in general views from the mountain tops are mere
specks lying inconspicuously here and there in out-of-the-way places
often thirty or forty miles apart

in leafy regions blessed with copious rains we learn to measure the
productive capacity of the soil by its natural vegetation but this
rule is almost wholly inapplicable here for notwithstanding its savage
nakedness scarce at all veiled by a sparse growth of sage and linosyris
[16] the desert soil of the great basin is as rich in the elements that
in rainy regions rise and ripen into food as that of any other state
in the union the rocks of its numerous mountain ranges have been
thoroughly crushed and ground by glaciers thrashed and vitalized by the
sun and sifted and outspread in lake basins by powerful torrents that
attended the breaking-up of the glacial period as if in every way
nature had been making haste to prepare the land for the husbandman
soil climate topographical conditions all that the most exacting
could demand are present but one thing water is wanting the present
rainfall would be wholly inadequate for agriculture even if it were
advantageously distributed over the lowlands while in fact the
greater portion is poured out on the heights in sudden and violent
thundershowers called "cloud-bursts" the waters of which are
fruitlessly swallowed up in sandy gulches and deltas a few minutes
after their first boisterous appearance the principal mountain chains
trending nearly north and south parallel with the sierra and the
wahsatch receive a good deal of snow during winter but no great
masses are stored up as fountains for large perennial streams capable
of irrigating considerable areas most of it is melted before the end
of may and absorbed by moraines and gravelly taluses which send forth
small rills that slip quietly down the upper canyons through narrow
strips of flowery verdure most of them sinking and vanishing before
they reach the base of their fountain ranges perhaps not one in ten
of the whole number flow out into the open plains not a single drop
reaches the sea and only a few are large enough to irrigate more than
one farm of moderate size

it is upon these small outflowing rills that most of the nevada ranches
are located lying countersunk beneath the general level just where the
mountains meet the plains at an average elevation of five thousand feet
above sea level all the cereals and garden vegetables thrive here
and yield bountiful crops fruit however has been as yet grown
successfully in only a few specially favored spots

another distinct class of ranches are found sparsely distributed along
the lowest portions of the plains where the ground is kept moist by
springs or by narrow threads of moving water called rivers fed by
some one or more of the most vigorous of the mountain rills that have
succeeded in making their escape from the mountains these are mostly
devoted to the growth of wild hay though in some the natural meadow
grasses and sedges have been supplemented by timothy and alfalfa and
where the soil is not too strongly impregnated with salts some grain
is raised reese river valley big smoky valley and white river valley
offer fair illustrations of this class as compared with the foothill
ranches they are larger and less inconspicuous as they lie in the
wide unshadowed levels of the plains wavy-edged flecks of green in a
wilderness of gray

still another class equally well defined both as to distribution and
as to products is restricted to that portion of western nevada and the
eastern border of california which lies within the redeeming influences
of california waters three of the sierra rivers descend from their icy
fountains into the desert like angels of mercy to bless nevada these
are the walker carson and truckee and in the valleys through which
they flow are found by far the most extensive hay and grain fields
within the bounds of the state irrigating streams are led off right and
left through innumerable channels and the sleeping ground starting at
once into action pours forth its wealth without stint

but notwithstanding the many porous fields thus fertilized considerable
portions of the waters of all these rivers continue to reach their old
deathbeds in the desert indicating that in these salt valleys there
still is room for coming farmers in middle and eastern nevada however
every rill that i have seen in a ride of three thousand miles at all
available for irrigation has been claimed and put to use

it appears therefore that under present conditions the limit of
agricultural development in the dry basin between the sierra and the
wahsatch has been already approached a result caused not alone by
natural restrictions as to the area capable of development but by the
extraordinary stimulus furnished by the mines to agricultural effort
the gathering of gold and silver hay and barley have gone on together
most of the mid-valley bogs and meadows and foothill rills capable of
irrigating from ten to fifty acres were claimed more than twenty years
ago

a majority of these pioneer settlers are plodding dutchmen living
content in the back lanes and valleys of nature but the high price
of all kinds of farm products tempted many of even the keen yankee
prospectors made wise in california to bind themselves down to this
sure kind of mining the wildest of wild hay made chiefly of carices
and rushes was sold at from two to three hundred dollars per ton on
ranches the same kind of hay is still worth from fifteen to forty
dollars per ton according to the distance from mines and comparative
security from competition barley and oats are from forty to one hundred
dollars a ton while all sorts of garden products find ready sale at
high prices

with rich mine markets and salubrious climate the nevada farmer can
make more money by loose ragged methods than the same class of farmers
in any other state i have yet seen while the almost savage isolation
in which they live seems grateful to them even in those cases where
the advent of neighbors brings no disputes concerning water rights and
ranges they seem to prefer solitude most of them having been elected
from adventurers from california the pioneers of pioneers the passing
stranger however is always welcomed and supplied with the best the
home affords and around the fireside while he smokes his pipe
very little encouragement is required to bring forth the story of the
farmer's life hunting mining fighting in the early indian times
etc only the few who are married hope to return to california to
educate their children and the ease with which money is made renders
the fulfillment of these hopes comparatively sure

after dwelling thus long on the farms of this dry wonderland my
readers may be led to fancy them of more importance as compared with the
unbroken fields of nature than they really are making your way along
any of the wide gray valleys that stretch from north to south seldom
will your eye be interrupted by a single mark of cultivation the smooth
lake-like ground sweeps on indefinitely growing more and more dim in
the glowing sunshine while a mountain range from eight to ten thousand
feet high bounds the view on either hand no singing water no green
sod no moist nook to rest in mountain and valley alike naked and
shadowless in the sun-glare and though perhaps traveling a well-worn
road to a gold or silver mine and supplied with repeated instructions
you can scarce hope to find any human habitation from day to day so
vast and impressive is the hot dusty alkaline wildness

but after riding some thirty or forty miles and while the sun may
be sinking behind the mountains you come suddenly upon signs of
cultivation clumps of willows indicate water and water indicates
a farm approaching more nearly you discover what may be a patch of
barley spread out unevenly along the bottom of a flood bed broken
perhaps and rendered less distinct by boulder piles and the fringing
willows of a stream speedily you can confidently say that the grain
patch is surely such its ragged bounds become clear a sand-roofed
cabin comes to view littered with sun-cracked implements and with an
outer girdle of potato cabbage and alfalfa patches

the immense expanse of mountain-girt valleys on the edges of which
these hidden ranches lie make even the largest fields seem comic
in size the smallest however are by no means insignificant in a
pecuniary view on the east side of the toyabe range i discovered
a jolly irishman who informed me that his income from fifty acres
reinforced by a sheep range on the adjacent hills was from seven to
nine thousand dollars per annum his irrigating brook is about four feet
wide and eight inches deep flowing about two miles per hour

on duckwater creek nye county mr irwin has reclaimed a tule swamp
several hundred acres in extent which is now chiefly devoted to
alfalfa on twenty-five acres he claims to have raised this year
thirty-seven tons of barley indeed i have not yet noticed a meager
crop of any kind in the state fruit alone is conspicuously absent

on the california side of the sierra grain will not ripen at much
greater elevation than four thousand feet above sea level the valleys
of nevada lie at a height of from four to six thousand feet and both
wheat and barley ripen wherever water may be had up to seven thousand
feet the harvest of course is later as the elevation increases in
the valleys of the carson and walker rivers four thousand feet above
the sea the grain harvest is about a month later than in california in
reese river valley six thousand feet it begins near the end of august
winter grain ripens somewhat earlier while occasionally one meets a
patch of barley in some cool high-lying canyon that will not mature
before the middle of september

unlike california nevada will probably be always richer in gold and
silver than in grain utah farmers hope to change the climate of the
east side of the basin by prayer and point to the recent rise in the
waters of the great salt lake as a beginning of moister times
but nevada's only hope in the way of any considerable increase in
agriculture is from artesian wells the experiment has been tried on a
small scale with encouraging success but what is now wanted seems to
be the boring of a few specimen wells of a large size out in the main
valleys the encouragement that successful experiments of this kind
would give to emigration seeking farms forms an object well worthy the
attention of the government but all that california farmers in the
grand central valley require is the preservation of the forests and
the wise distribution of the glorious abundance of water from the snow
stored on the west flank of the sierra

whether any considerable area of these sage plains will ever thus be
made to blossom in grass and wheat experience will show but in the
mean time nevada is beautiful in her wildness and if tillers of the
soil can thus be brought to see that possibly nature may have other uses
even for rich soils besides the feeding of human beings then will these
foodless "deserts" have taught a fine lesson




xiii nevada forests [17]


when the traveler from california has crossed the sierra and gone a
little way down the eastern flank the woods come to an end about as
suddenly and completely as if going westward he had reached the ocean
from the very noblest forests in the world he emerges into free sunshine
and dead alkaline lake-levels mountains are seen beyond rising in
bewildering abundance range beyond range but however closely we have
been accustomed to associate forests and mountains these always present
a singularly barren aspect appearing gray and forbidding and shadeless
like heaps of ashes dumped from the blazing sky

but wheresoever we may venture to go in all this good world nature is
ever found richer and more beautiful than she seems and nowhere may you
meet with more varied and delightful surprises than in the byways and
recesses of this sublime wilderness lovely asters and abronias on the
dusty plains rose-gardens around the mountain wells and resiny woods
where all seemed so desolate adorning the hot foothills as well as the
cool summits fed by cordial and benevolent storms of rain and hail
and snow all of these scant and rare as compared with the immeasurable
exuberance of california but still amply sufficient throughout the
barest deserts for a clear manifestation of god's love

though nevada is situated in what is called the "great basin" no less
than sixty-five groups and chains of mountains rise within the bounds of
the state to a height of about from eight thousand to thirteen thousand
feet above the level of the sea and as far as i have observed every
one of these is planted to some extent with coniferous trees though
it is only upon the highest that we find anything that may fairly be
called a forest the lower ranges and the foothills and slopes of the
higher are roughened with small scrubby junipers and nut pines while
the dominating peaks together with the ridges that swing in grand
curves between them are covered with a closer and more erect growth of
pine spruce and fir resembling the forests of the eastern states both
as to size and general botanical characteristics here is found what
is called the heavy timber but the tallest and most fully developed
sections of the forests growing down in sheltered hollows on moist
moraines would be regarded in california only as groves of saplings
and so relatively they are for by careful calculation we find that
more than a thousand of these trees would be required to furnish as much
timber as may be obtained from a single specimen of our sierra giants

the height of the timberline in eastern nevada near the middle of the
great basin is about eleven thousand feet above sea level consequently
the forests in a dwarfed storm-beaten condition pass over the summits
of nearly every range in the state broken here and there only by
mechanical conditions of the surface rocks only three mountains in
the state have as yet come under my observation whose summits rise
distinctly above the treeline these are wheeler's peak twelve thousand
three hundred feet high mount moriah about twelve thousand feet and
granite mountain about the same height all of which are situated near
the boundary line between nevada and utah territory

in a rambling mountaineering journey of eighteen hundred miles across
the state i have met nine species of coniferous trees four pines two
spruces two junipers and one fir about one third the number found
in california by far the most abundant and interesting of these is the
pinus fremontiana [18] or nut pine in the number of individual trees
and extent of range this curious little conifer surpasses all the others
combined nearly every mountain in the state is planted with it from
near the base to a height of from eight thousand to nine thousand feet
above the sea some are covered from base to summit by this one species
with only a sparse growth of juniper on the lower slopes to break the
continuity of these curious woods which though dark-looking at a
little distance are yet almost shadeless and without any hint of the
dark glens and hollows so characteristic of other pine woods tens
of thousands of acres occur in one continuous belt indeed viewed
comprehensively the entire state seems to be pretty evenly divided into
mountain ranges covered with nut pines and plains covered with sage now
a swath of pines stretching from north to south now a swath of sage
the one black the other gray one severely level the other sweeping on
complacently over ridge and valley and lofty crowning dome

the real character of a forest of this sort would never be guessed by
the inexperienced observer traveling across the sage levels in the
dazzling sunlight you gaze with shaded eyes at the mountains rising
along their edges perhaps twenty miles away but no invitation that is
at all likely to be understood is discernible every mountain however
high it swells into the sky seems utterly barren approaching nearer
a low brushy growth is seen strangely black in aspect as though it had
been burned this is a nut pine forest the bountiful orchard of the
red man when you ascend into its midst you find the ground beneath the
trees and in the openings also nearly naked and mostly rough on the
surface a succession of crumbling ledges of lava limestones slate
and quartzite coarsely strewn with soil weathered from them here and
there occurs a bunch of sage or linosyris or a purple aster or a tuft
of dry bunch-grass

the harshest mountainsides hot and waterless seem best adapted to
the nut pine's development no slope is too steep none too dry every
situation seems to be gratefully chosen if only it be sufficiently
rocky and firm to afford secure anchorage for the tough grasping roots
it is a sturdy thickset little tree usually about fifteen feet high
when full grown and about as broad as high holding its knotty
branches well out in every direction in stiff zigzags but turning them
gracefully upward at the ends in rounded bosses though making so dark
a mass in the distance the foliage is a pale grayish green in stiff
awl-shaped fascicles when examined closely these round needles seem
inclined to be two-leaved but they are mostly held firmly together
as if to guard against evaporation the bark on the older sections is
nearly black so that the boles and branches are clearly traced against
the prevailing gray of the mountains on which they delight to dwell

the value of this species to nevada is not easily overestimated it
furnishes fuel charcoal and timber for the mines and together with
the enduring juniper so generally associated with it supplies the
ranches with abundance of firewood and rough fencing many a square mile
has already been denuded in supplying these demands but so great is
the area covered by it no appreciable loss has as yet been sustained
it is pretty generally known that this tree yields edible nuts but
their importance and excellence as human food is infinitely greater than
is supposed in fruitful seasons like this one the pine nut crop of
nevada is perhaps greater than the entire wheat crop of california
concerning which so much is said and felt throughout the food markets of
the world

the indians alone appreciate this portion of nature's bounty and
celebrate the harvest home with dancing and feasting the cones which
are a bright grass-green in color and about two inches long by one and a
half in diameter are beaten off with poles just before the scales open
gathered in heaps of several bushels and lightly scorched by burning
a thin covering of brushwood over them the resin with which the cones
are bedraggled is thus burned off the nuts slightly roasted and the
scales made to open then they are allowed to dry in the sun after
which the nuts are easily thrashed out and are ready to be stored away
they are about half an inch long by a quarter of an inch in diameter
pointed at the upper end rounded at the base light brown in general
color and handsomely dotted with purple like birds' eggs the shells
are thin and may be crushed between the thumb and finger the kernels
are white and waxy-looking becoming brown by roasting sweet and
delicious to every palate and are eaten by birds squirrels dogs
horses and man when the crop is abundant the indians bring in large
quantities for sale they are eaten around every fireside in the state
and oftentimes fed to horses instead of barley

looking over the whole continent none of nature's bounties seems to
me so great as this in the way of food none so little appreciated
fortunately for the indians and wild animals that gather around nature's
board this crop is not easily harvested in a monopolizing way if
it could be gathered like wheat the whole would be carried away and
dissipated in towns leaving the brave inhabitants of these wilds to
starve

long before the harvest time which is in september and october the
indians examine the trees with keen discernment and inasmuch as the
cones require two years to mature from the first appearance of the
little red rosettes of the fertile flowers the scarcity or abundance
of the crop may be predicted more than a year in advance squirrels and
worms and clarke crows make haste to begin the harvest when the crop
is ripe the indians make ready their long beating-poles baskets bags
rags mats are gotten together the squaws out among the settlers at
service washing and drudging assemble at the family huts the men
leave their ranch work all old and young are mounted on ponies and
set off in great glee to the nut lands forming cavalcades curiously
picturesque flaming scarfs and calico skirts stream loosely over the
knotty ponies usually two squaws astride of each with the small baby
midgets bandaged in baskets slung on their backs or balanced upon the
saddle-bow while the nut baskets and water jars project from either
side and the long beating-poles like old-fashioned lances angle out
in every direction

arrived at some central point already fixed upon where water and grass
is found the squaws with baskets the men with poles ascend the ridges
to the laden trees followed by the children beating begins with loud
noise and chatter the burs fly right and left lodging against stones
and sagebrush the squaws and children gather them with fine natural
gladness smoke columns speedily mark the joyful scene of their labors
as the roasting fires are kindled and at night assembled in circles
garrulous as jays the first grand nut feast begins sufficient
quantities are thus obtained in a few weeks to last all winter

the indians also gather several species of berries and dry them to vary
their stores and a few deer and grouse are killed on the mountains
besides immense numbers of rabbits and hares but the pine-nuts are
their main dependence their staff of life their bread

insects also scarce noticed by man come in for their share of this
fine bounty eggs are deposited and the baby grubs happy fellows find
themselves in a sweet world of plenty feeding their way through the
heart of the cone from one nut chamber to another secure from rain and
wind and heat until their wings are grown and they are ready to launch
out into the free ocean of air and light




xiv nevada's timber belt [19]


the pine woods on the tops of the nevada mountains are already shining
and blooming in winter snow making a most blessedly refreshing
appearance to the weary traveler down on the gray plains during the
fiery days of summer the whole of this vast region seems so perfectly
possessed by the sun that the very memories of pine trees and snow are
in danger of being burned away leaving one but little more than dust
and metal but since these first winter blessings have come the wealth
and beauty of the landscapes have come fairly into view and one is
rendered capable of looking and seeing

the grand nut harvest is over as far as the indians are concerned
though perhaps less than one bushel in a thousand of the whole crop has
been gathered but the squirrels and birds are still busily engaged
and by the time that nature's ends are accomplished every nut will
doubtless have been put to use

all of the nine nevada conifers mentioned in my last letter are also
found in california excepting only the rocky mountain spruce which i
have not observed westward of the snake range so greatly however have
they been made to vary by differences of soil and climate that most of
them appear as distinct species without seeming in any way dwarfed or
repressed in habit they nowhere develop to anything like california
dimensions a height of fifty feet and diameter of twelve or fourteen
inches would probably be found to be above the average size of those
cut for lumber on the margin of the carson and humboldt sink the larger
sage bushes are called "heavy timber" and to the settlers here any tree
seems large enough for saw-logs

mills have been built in the most accessible canyons of the higher
ranges and sufficient lumber of an inferior kind is made to supply most
of the local demand the principal lumber trees of nevada are the white
pine (pinus flexilis) foxtail pine and douglas spruce or "red
pine" as it is called here of these the first named is most generally
distributed being found on all the higher ranges throughout the state
in botanical characters it is nearly allied to the weymouth or white
pine of the eastern states and to the sugar and mountain pines of the
sierra in open situations it branches near the ground and tosses out
long down-curving limbs all around often gaining in this way a very
strikingly picturesque habit it is seldom found lower than nine
thousand feet above the level of the sea but from this height it
pushes upward over the roughest ledges to the extreme limit of tree
growth about eleven thousand feet

on the hot creek white pine and golden gate ranges we find a still
hardier and more picturesque species called the foxtail pine from its
long dense leaf-tassels about a foot or eighteen inches of the ends of
the branches are densely packed with stiff outstanding needles which
radiate all around like an electric fox- or squirrel-tail the needles
are about an inch and a half long slightly curved elastic and
glossily polished so that the sunshine sifting through them makes them
burn with a fine silvery luster while their number and elastic temper
tell delightfully in the singing winds

this tree is pre-eminently picturesque far surpassing not only its
companion species of the mountains in this respect but also the most
noted of the lowland oaks and elms some stand firmly erect feathered
with radiant tail tassels down to the ground forming slender tapering
towers of shining verdure others with two or three specialized branches
pushed out at right angles to the trunk and densely clad with the
tasseled sprays take the form of beautiful ornamental crosses again
in the same woods you find trees that are made up of several boles
united near the ground and spreading in easy curves at the sides in
a plane parallel to the axis of the mountain with the elegant tassels
hung in charming order between them the whole making a perfect harp
ranged across the main wind-lines just where they may be most effective
in the grand storm harmonies and then there is an infinite variety of
arching forms standing free or in groups leaning away from or toward
each other in curious architectural structures innumerable tassels
drooping under the arches and radiating above them the outside glowing
in the light masses of deep shade beneath giving rise to effects
marvelously beautiful while on the roughest ledges of crumbling
limestone are lowly old giants five or six feet in diameter that have
braved the storms of more than a thousand years but whether old or
young sheltered or exposed to the wildest gales this tree is ever
found to be irrepressibly and extravagantly picturesque offering a
richer and more varied series of forms to the artist than any other
species i have yet seen

one of the most interesting mountain excursions i have made in the state
was up through a thick spicy forest of these trees to the top of the
highest summit of the troy range about ninety miles to the south of
hamilton the day was full of perfect indian-summer sunshine calm and
bracing jays and clarke crows made a pleasant stir in the foothill
pines and junipers grasshoppers danced in the hazy light and rattled
on the wing in pure glee reviving suddenly from the torpor of a frosty
october night to exuberant summer joy the squirrels were working
industriously among the falling nuts ripe willows and aspens made
gorgeous masses of color on the russet hillsides and along the edges of
the small streams that threaded the higher ravines and on the smooth
sloping uplands beneath the foxtail pines and firs the ground was
covered with brown grasses enriched with sunflowers columbines and
larkspurs and patches of linosyris mostly frost-nipped and gone to
seed yet making fine bits of yellow and purple in the general brown

at a height of about ninety-five hundred feet we passed through a
magnificent grove of aspens about a hundred acres in extent through
which the mellow sunshine sifted in ravishing splendor showing every
leaf to be as beautiful in color as the wing of a butterfly and making
them tell gloriously against the evergreens these extensive groves
of aspen are a marked feature of the nevada woods some of the lower
mountains are covered with them giving rise to remarkably beautiful
masses of pale translucent green in spring and summer yellow and
orange in autumn while in winter after every leaf has fallen the
white bark of the boles and branches seen in mass seems like a cloud of
mist that has settled close down on the mountain conforming to all
its hollows and ridges like a mantle yet roughened on the surface with
innumerable ascending spires

just above the aspens we entered a fine close growth of foxtail pine
the tallest and most evenly planted i had yet seen it extended along a
waving ridge tending north and south and down both sides with but little
interruption for a distance of about five miles the trees were mostly
straight in the bole and their shade covered the ground in the densest
places leaving only small openings to the sun a few of the tallest
specimens measured over eighty feet with a diameter of eighteen inches
but many of the younger trees growing in tufts were nearly fifty feet
high with a diameter of only five or six inches while their slender
shafts were hidden from top to bottom by a close fringy growth of
tasseled branchlets a few white pines and balsam firs occur here and
there mostly around the edges of sunny openings where they enrich the
air with their rosiny fragrance and bring out the peculiar beauties of
the predominating foxtails by contrast

birds find grateful homes here grouse chickadees and linnets of
which we saw large flocks that had a delightfully enlivening effect but
the woodpeckers are remarkably rare thus far i have noticed only one
species the golden-winged and but few of the streams are large enough
or long enough to attract the blessed ousel so common in the sierra

on wheeler's peak the dominating summit of the snake mountains i found
all the conifers i had seen on the other ranges of the state excepting
the foxtail pine which i have not observed further east than the white
pine range but in its stead the beautiful rocky mountain spruce first
as in the other ranges we find the juniper and nut pine then higher
the white pine and balsam fir then the douglas spruce and this new
rocky mountain spruce which is common eastward from here though this
range is as far as i have observed its western limit it is one of
the largest and most important of nevada conifers attaining a height of
from sixty to eighty feet and a diameter of nearly two feet while now
and then an exceptional specimen may be found in shady dells a hundred
feet high or more

the foliage is bright yellowish and bluish green according to exposure
and age growing all around the branchlets though inclined to turn
upward from the undersides like that of the plushy firs of california
making remarkably handsome fernlike plumes while yet only mere saplings
five or six inches thick at the ground they measure fifty or sixty feet
in height and are beautifully clothed with broad level fronded plumes
down to the base preserving a strict arrowy outline though a few of
the larger branches shoot out in free exuberance relieving the spire
from any unpicturesque stiffness of aspect while the conical summit is
crowded with thousands of rich brown cones to complete its beauty

we made the ascent of the peak just after the first storm had whitened
its summit and brightened the atmosphere the foot-slopes are like those
of the troy range only more evenly clad with grasses after tracing a
long rugged ridge of exceedingly hard quartzite said to be veined here
and there with gold we came to the north dome a noble summit rising
about a thousand feet above the timberline its slopes heavily tree-clad
all around but most perfectly on the north here the rocky mountain
spruce forms the bulk of the forest the cones were ripe most of
them had shed their winged seeds and the shell-like scales were
conspicuously spread making rich masses of brown from the tops of the
fertile trees down halfway to the ground cone touching cone in lavish
clusters a single branch that might be carried in the hand would be
found to bear a hundred or more

some portions of the wood were almost impenetrable but in general we
found no difficulty in mazing comfortably on over fallen logs and
under the spreading boughs while here and there we came to an opening
sufficiently spacious for standpoints where the trees around their
margins might be seen from top to bottom the winter sunshine streamed
through the clustered spires glinting and breaking into a fine dust of
spangles on the spiky leaves and beads of amber gum and bringing out
the reds and grays and yellows of the lichened boles which had been
freshened by the late storm while the tip of every spire looking up
through the shadows was dipped in deepest blue

the ground was strewn with burs and needles and fallen trees and down
in the dells on the north side of the dome where strips of aspen are
imbedded in the spruces every breeze sent the ripe leaves flying some
lodging in the spruce boughs making them bloom again while the fresh
snow beneath looked like a fine painting

around the dome and well up toward the summit of the main peak the
snow-shed was well marked with tracks of the mule deer and the pretty
stitching and embroidery of field mice squirrels and grouse and on
the way back to camp i came across a strange track somewhat like that
of a small bear but more spreading at the toes it proved to be that
of a wolverine in my conversations with hunters both indians and white
men assure me that there are no bears in nevada notwithstanding the
abundance of pine-nuts of which they are so fond and the accessibility
of these basin ranges from their favorite haunts in the sierra nevada
and wahsatch mountains the mule deer antelope wild sheep wolverine
and two species of wolves are all of the larger animals that i have seen
or heard of in the state




xv glacial phenomena in nevada [20]


the monuments of the ice age in the great basin have been greatly
obscured and broken many of the more ancient of them having perished
altogether leaving scarce a mark however faint of their existence a
condition of things due not alone to the long-continued action of
post-glacial agents but also in great part to the perishable character
of the rocks of which they were made the bottoms of the main valleys
once grooved and planished like the glacier pavements of the sierra
lie buried beneath sediments and detritus derived from the adjacent
mountains and now form the arid sage plains characteristic u-shaped
canyons have become v-shaped by the deepening of their bottoms and
straightening of their sides and decaying glacier headlands have been
undermined and thrown down in loose taluses while most of the
moraines and striae and scratches have been blurred or weathered away
nevertheless enough remains of the more recent and the more enduring
phenomena to cast a good light well back upon the conditions of the
ancient ice sheet that covered this interesting region and upon the
system of distinct glaciers that loaded the tops of the mountains and
filled the canyons long after the ice sheet had been broken up

the first glacial traces that i noticed in the basin are on the wassuck
augusta and toyabe ranges consisting of ridges and canyons whose
trends contours and general sculpture are in great part specifically
glacial though deeply blurred by subsequent denudation these
discoveries were made during the summer of 1876-77 and again on the
17th of last august while making the ascent of mount jefferson the
dominating mountain of the toquima range i discovered an exceedingly
interesting group of moraines canyons with v-shaped cross sections
wide neve amphitheatres moutoneed rocks glacier meadows and one
glacier lake all as fresh and telling as if the glaciers to which they
belonged had scarcely vanished

the best preserved and most regular of the moraines are two laterals
about two hundred feet in height and two miles long extending from the
foot of a magnificent canyon valley on the north side of the mountain
and trending first in a northerly direction then curving around to the
west while a well-characterized terminal moraine formed by the
glacier towards the close of its existence unites them near their lower
extremities at a height of eighty-five hundred feet another pair of
older lateral moraines belonging to a glacier of which the one just
mentioned was a tributary extend in a general northwesterly direction
nearly to the level of big smoky valley about fifty-five hundred feet
above sea level

four other canyons extending down the eastern slopes of this grand old
mountain into monito valley are hardly less rich in glacial records
while the effects of the mountain shadows in controlling and directing
the movements of the residual glaciers to which all these phenomena
belonged are everywhere delightfully apparent in the trends of the
canyons and ridges and in the massive sculpture of the neve wombs at
their heads this is a very marked and imposing mountain attracting
the eye from a great distance it presents a smooth and gently curved
outline against the sky as observed from the plains and is whitened
with patches of enduring snow the summit is made up of irregular
volcanic tables the most extensive of which is about two and a half
miles long and like the smaller ones is broken abruptly down on the
edges by the action of the ice its height is approximately eleven
thousand three hundred feet above the sea

a few days after making these interesting discoveries i found other
well-preserved glacial traces on arc dome the culminating summit of
the toyabe range on its northeastern slopes there are two small glacier
lakes and the basins of two others which have recently been filled with
down-washed detritus one small residual glacier lingered until quite
recently beneath the coolest shadows of the dome the moraines and
neve-fountains of which are still as fresh and unwasted as many of those
lying at the same elevation on the sierra ten thousand feet while
older and more wasted specimens may be traced on all the adjacent
mountains the sculpture too of all the ridges and summits of this
section of the range is recognized at once as glacial some of the
larger characters being still easily readable from the plains at a
distance of fifteen or twenty miles

the hot creek mountains lying to the east of the toquima and monito
ranges reach the culminating point on a deeply serrate ridge at a
height of ten thousand feet above the sea this ridge is found to be
made up of a series of imposing towers and pinnacles which have been
eroded from the solid mass of the mountain by a group of small residual
glaciers that lingered in their shadows long after the larger ice
rivers had vanished on its western declivities are found a group of
well-characterized moraines canyons and roches moutonnees all of
which are unmistakably fresh and telling the moraines in particular
could hardly fail to attract the eye of any observer some of the short
laterals of the glaciers that drew their fountain snows from the jagged
recesses of the summit are from one to two hundred feet in height and
scarce at all wasted as yet notwithstanding the countless storms that
have fallen upon them while cool rills flow between them watering
charming gardens of arctic plants saxifrages larkspurs dwarf
birch ribes and parnassia etc beautiful memories of the ice age
representing a once greatly extended flora

in the course of explorations made to the eastward of here between the
38th and 40th parallels i observed glacial phenomena equally fresh
and demonstrative on all the higher mountains of the white pine golden
gate and snake ranges varying from those already described only as
determined by differences of elevation relations to the snow-bearing
winds and the physical characteristics of the rock formations

on the jeff davis group of the snake range the dominating summit of
which is nearly thirteen thousand feet in elevation and the highest
ground in the basin every marked feature is a glacier monument peaks
valleys ridges meadows and lakes and because here the snow-fountains
lay at a greater height while the rock an exceedingly hard quartzite
offered superior resistance to post-glacial agents the ice-characters
are on a larger scale and are more sharply defined than any we have
noticed elsewhere and it is probably here that the last lingering
glacier of the basin was located the summits and connecting ridges are
mere blades and points ground sharp by the glaciers that descended on
both sides to the main valleys from one standpoint i counted nine of
these glacial channels with their moraines sweeping grandly out to the
plains to deep sheer-walled neve-fountains at their heads making a most
vivid picture of the last days of the ice period

i have thus far directed attention only to the most recent and
appreciable of the phenomena but it must be borne in mind that less
recent and less obvious traces of glacial action abound on all the
ranges throughout the entire basin where the fine striae and grooves
have been obliterated and most of the moraines have been washed away
or so modified as to be no longer recognizable and even the lakes and
meadows so characteristic of glacial regions have almost entirely
vanished for there are other monuments far more enduring than these
remaining tens of thousands of years after the more perishable records
are lost such are the canyons ridges and peaks themselves the
glacial peculiarities of whose trends and contours cannot be hid from
the eye of the skilled observer until changes have been wrought upon
them far more destructive than those to which these basin ranges have
yet been subjected

it appears therefore that the last of the basin glaciers have but
recently vanished and that the almost innumerable ranges trending north
and south between the sierra and the wahsatch mountains were loaded with
glaciers that descended to the adjacent valleys during the last glacial
period and that it is to this mighty host of ice streams that all the
more characteristic of the present features of these mountain ranges are
due

but grand as is this vision delineated in these old records this is
not all for there is not wanting evidence of a still grander glaciation
extending over all the valleys now forming the sage plains as well
as the mountains the basins of the main valleys alternating with the
mountain ranges and which contained lakes during at least the closing
portion of the ice period were eroded wholly or in part from a
general elevated tableland by immense glaciers that flowed north
and south to the ocean the mountains as well as the valleys present
abundant evidence of this grand origin

the flanks of all the interior ranges are seen to have been heavily
abraded and ground away by the ice acting in a direction parallel
with their axes this action is most strikingly shown upon projecting
portions where the pressure has been greatest these are shorn off
in smooth planes and bossy outswelling curves like the outstanding
portions of canyon walls moreover the extremities of the ranges
taper out like those of dividing ridges which have been ground away by
dividing and confluent glaciers furthermore the horizontal sections
of separate mountains standing isolated in the great valleys are
lens-shaped like those of mere rocks that rise in the channels of
ordinary canyon glaciers and which have been overflowed or pastflowed
while in many of the smaller valleys roches moutonnees occur in great
abundance

again the mineralogical and physical characters of the two ranges
bounding the sides of many of the valleys indicate that the valleys were
formed simply by the removal of the material between the ranges and
again the rim of the general basin where it is elevated as for
example on the southwestern portion instead of being a ridge sculptured
on the sides like a mountain range is found to be composed of many
short ranges parallel to one another and to the interior ranges and
so modeled as to resemble a row of convex lenses set on edge and half
buried beneath a general surface without manifesting any dependence
upon synclinal or anticlinal axes a series of forms and relations that
could have resulted only from the outflow of vast basin glaciers on
their courses to the ocean

i cannot however present all the evidence here bearing upon these
interesting questions much less discuss it in all its relations i
will therefore close this letter with a few of the more important
generalizations that have grown up out of the facts that i have
observed first at the beginning of the glacial period the region now
known as the great basin was an elevated tableland not furrowed as
at present with mountains and valleys but comparatively bald and
featureless

second this tableland bounded on the east and west by lofty mountain
ranges but comparatively open on the north and south was loaded with
ice which was discharged to the ocean northward and southward and
in its flow brought most if not all the present interior ranges and
valleys into relief by erosion

third as the glacial winter drew near its close the ice vanished from
the lower portions of the basin which then became lakes into which
separate glaciers descended from the mountains then these mountain
glaciers vanished in turn after sculpturing the ranges into their
present condition

fourth the few immense lakes extending over the lowlands in the midst
of which many of the interior ranges stood as islands became shallow
as the ice vanished from the mountains and separated into many distinct
lakes whose waters no longer reached the ocean most of these have
disappeared by the filling of their basins with detritus from the
mountains and now form sage plains and "alkali flats"

the transition from one to the other of these various conditions was
gradual and orderly first a nearly simple tableland then a grand mer
de glace shedding its crawling silver currents to the sea and becoming
gradually more wrinkled as unequal erosion roughened its bed and
brought the highest peaks and ridges above the surface then a land of
lakes an almost continuous sheet of water stretching from the sierra
to the wahsatch adorned with innumerable island mountains then a slow
desiccation and decay to present conditions of sage and sand




xvi nevada's dead towns [21]


nevada is one of the very youngest and wildest of the states
nevertheless it is already strewn with ruins that seem as gray and
silent and time-worn as if the civilization to which they belonged had
perished centuries ago yet strange to say all these ruins are results
of mining efforts made within the last few years wander where you may
throughout the length and breadth of this mountain-barred wilderness
you everywhere come upon these dead mining towns with their tall
chimney stacks standing forlorn amid broken walls and furnaces and
machinery half buried in sand the very names of many of them already
forgotten amid the excitements of later discoveries and now known only
through tradition tradition ten years old

while exploring the mountain ranges of the state during a considerable
portion of three summers i think that i have seen at least five of
these deserted towns and villages for every one in ordinary life some
of them were probably only camps built by bands of prospectors and
inhabited for a few months or years while some specially interesting
canyon was being explored and then carelessly abandoned for more
promising fields but many were real towns regularly laid out and
incorporated containing well-built hotels churches schoolhouses post
offices and jails as well as the mills on which they all depended and
whose well-graded streets were filled with lawyers doctors brokers
hangmen real estate agents etc the whole population numbering
several thousand

a few years ago the population of hamilton is said to have been nearly
eight thousand that of treasure hill six thousand of shermantown
seven thousand of swansea three thousand all of these were
incorporated towns with mayors councils fire departments and daily
newspapers hamilton has now about one hundred inhabitants most of whom
are merely waiting in dreary inaction for something to turn up treasure
hill has about half as many shermantown one family and swansea none
while on the other hand the graveyards are far too full

in one canyon of the toyabe range near austin i found no less than
five dead towns without a single inhabitant the streets and blocks of
"real estate" graded on the hillsides are rapidly falling back into
the wilderness sagebrushes are growing up around the forges of the
blacksmith shops and lizards bask on the crumbling walls

while traveling southward from austin down big smoky valley i noticed a
remarkably tall and imposing column rising like a lone pine out of the
sagebrush on the edge of a dry gulch this proved to be a smokestack of
solid masonry it seemed strangely out of place in the desert as if it
had been transported entire from the heart of some noisy manufacturing
town and left here by mistake i learned afterwards that it belonged
to a set of furnaces that were built by a new york company to smelt ore
that never was found the tools of the workmen are still lying in place
beside the furnaces as if dropped in some sudden indian or earthquake
panic and never afterwards handled these imposing ruins together with
the desolate town lying a quarter of a mile to the northward present
a most vivid picture of wasted effort coyotes now wander unmolested
through the brushy streets and of all the busy throng that so lavishly
spent their time and money here only one man remains a lone bachelor
with one suspender

mining discoveries and progress retrogression and decay seem to have
been crowded more closely against each other here than on any other
portion of the globe some one of the band of adventurous prospectors
who came from the exhausted placers of california would discover some
rich ore how much or little mattered not at first these specimens fell
among excited seekers after wealth like sparks in gunpowder and in a
few days the wilderness was disturbed with the noisy clang of miners and
builders a little town would then spring up and before anything like a
careful survey of any particular lode would be made a company would
be formed and expensive mills built then after all the machinery
was ready for the ore perhaps little or none at all was to be
found meanwhile another discovery was reported and the young town was
abandoned as completely as a camp made for a single night and so on
until some really valuable lode was found such as those of eureka
austin virginia etc which formed the substantial groundwork for a
thousand other excitements

passing through the dead town of schellbourne last month i asked one of
the few lingering inhabitants why the town was built "for the mines"
he replied "and where are the mines?" "on the mountains back here"
"and why were they abandoned?" i asked "are they exhausted?" "oh no"
he replied "they are not exhausted on the contrary they have never
been worked at all for unfortunately just as we were about ready to
open them the cherry creek mines were discovered across the valley in
the egan range and everybody rushed off there taking what they could
with them houses machinery and all but we are hoping that somebody
with money and speculation will come and revive us yet"

the dead mining excitements of nevada were far more intense and
destructive in their action than those of california because the prizes
at stake were greater while more skill was required to gain them the
long trains of gold-seekers making their way to california had ample
time and means to recover from their first attacks of mining fever while
crawling laboriously across the plains and on their arrival on any
portion of the sierra gold belt they at once began to make money no
matter in what gulch or canyon they worked some measure of success
was sure however unskillful they might be and though while making ten
dollars a day they might be agitated by hopes of making twenty or of
striking their picks against hundred- or thousand-dollar nuggets men
of ordinary nerve could still work on with comparative steadiness and
remain rational

but in the case of the nevada miner he too often spent himself in years
of weary search without gaining a dollar traveling hundreds of miles
from mountain to mountain burdened with wasting hopes of discovering
some hidden vein worth millions enduring hardships of the most
destructive kind driving innumerable tunnels into the hillsides while
his assayed specimens again and again proved worthless perhaps one in
a hundred of these brave prospectors would "strike it rich" while
ninety-nine died alone in the mountains or sank out of sight in the
corners of saloons in a haze of whiskey and tobacco smoke

the healthful ministry of wealth is blessed and surely it is a fine
thing that so many are eager to find the gold and silver that lie hid
in the veins of the mountains but in the search the seekers too often
become insane and strike about blindly in the dark like raving madmen
seven hundred and fifty tons of ore from the original eberhardt mine on
treasure hill yielded a million and a half dollars the whole of this
immense sum having been obtained within two hundred and fifty feet of
the surface the greater portion within one hundred and forty feet
other ore masses were scarcely less marvelously rich giving rise to
one of the most violent excitements that ever occurred in the history of
mining all kinds of people shoemakers tailors farmers etc as
well as miners left their own right work and fell in a perfect storm of
energy upon the white pine hills covering the ground like grasshoppers
and seeming determined by the very violence of their efforts to turn
every stone to silver but with few exceptions these mining storms pass
away about as suddenly as they rise leaving only ruins to tell of the
tremendous energy expended as heaps of giant boulders in the valley
tell of the spent power of the mountain floods

in marked contrast with this destructive unrest is the orderly
deliberation into which miners settle in developing a truly valuable
mine at eureka we were kindly led through the treasure chambers of the
richmond and eureka consolidated our guides leisurely leading the way
from level to level calling attention to the precious ore masses
which the workmen were slowly breaking to pieces with their picks like
navvies wearing away the day in a railroad cutting while down at the
smelting works the bars of bullion were handled with less eager haste
than the farmer shows in gathering his sheaves

the wealth nevada has already given to the world is indeed wonderful
but the only grand marvel is the energy expended in its development
the amount of prospecting done in the face of so many dangers and
sacrifices the innumerable tunnels and shafts bored into the mountains
the mills that have been built these would seem to require a race of
giants but in full view of the substantial results achieved the pure
waste manifest in the ruins one meets never fails to produce a saddening
effect

the dim old ruins of europe so eagerly sought after by travelers have
something pleasing about them whatever their historical associations
for they at least lend some beauty to the landscape their picturesque
towers and arches seem to be kindly adopted by nature and planted
with wild flowers and wreathed with ivy while their rugged angles are
soothed and freshened and embossed with green mosses fresh life and
decay mingling in pleasing measures and the whole vanishing softly like
a ripe tranquil day fading into night so also among the older ruins
of the east there is a fitness felt they have served their time and
like the weather-beaten mountains are wasting harmoniously the same is
in some degree true of the dead mining towns of california

but those lying to the eastward of the sierra throughout the ranges of
the great basin waste in the dry wilderness like the bones of cattle
that have died of thirst many of them do not represent any good
accomplishment and have no right to be they are monuments of fraud and
ignorance sins against science the drifts and tunnels in the rocks may
perhaps be regarded as the prayers of the prospector offered for the
wealth he so earnestly craves but like prayers of any kind not in
harmony with nature they are unanswered but after all effort
however misapplied is better than stagnation better toil blindly
beating every stone in turn for grains of gold whether they contain any
or not than lie down in apathetic decay

the fever period is fortunately passing away the prospector is no
longer the raving wandering ghoul of ten years ago rushing in random
lawlessness among the hills hungry and footsore but cool and skillful
well supplied with every necessary and clad in his right mind
capitalists too and the public in general have become wiser and do
not take fire so readily from mining sparks while at the same time a
vast amount of real work is being done and the ratio between growth and
decay is constantly becoming better




xvii puget sound


washington territory recently admitted [22] into the union as a state
lies between latitude 46 degrees and 49 degrees and longitude 117
degrees and 125 degrees forming the northwest shoulder of the united
states the majestic range of the cascade mountains naturally
divides the state into two distinct parts called eastern and western
washington differing greatly from each other in almost every way the
western section being less than half as large as the eastern and with
its copious rains and deep fertile soil being clothed with forests of
evergreens while the eastern section is dry and mostly treeless though
fertile in many parts and producing immense quantities of wheat and
hay few states are more fertile and productive in one way or another
than washington or more strikingly varied in natural features or
resources

within her borders every kind of soil and climate may be found the
densest woods and dryest plains the smoothest levels and roughest
mountains she is rich in square miles (some seventy thousand of them)
in coal timber and iron and in sheltered inland waters that render
these resources advantageously accessible she also is already rich in
busy workers who work hard though not always wisely hacking burning
blasting their way deeper into the wilderness beneath the sky and
beneath the ground the wedges of development are being driven hard and
none of the obstacles or defenses of nature can long withstand the onset
of this immeasurable industry

puget sound so justly famous the world over for the surpassing size and
excellence and abundance of its timber is a long many-fingered arm of
the sea reaching southward from the head of the strait of juan de
fuca into the heart of the grand forests of the western portion of
washington between the cascade range and the mountains of the coast it
is less than a hundred miles in length but so numerous are the branches
into which it divides and so many its bays harbors and islands
that its entire shoreline is said to measure more than eighteen hundred
miles throughout its whole vast extent ships move in safety and find
shelter from every wind that blows the entire mountain-girt sea forming
one grand unrivaled harbor and center for commerce

the forest trees press forward to the water around all the windings of
the shores in most imposing array as if they were courting their fate
coming down from the mountains far and near to offer themselves to the
axe thus making the place a perfect paradise for the lumberman to the
lover of nature the scene is enchanting water and sky mountain and
forest clad in sunshine and clouds are composed in landscapes
sublime in magnitude yet exquisitely fine and fresh and full of
glad rejoicing life the shining waters stretch away into the leafy
wilderness now like the reaches of some majestic river and again
expanding into broad roomy spaces like mountain lakes their farther
edges fading gradually and blending with the pale blue of the sky the
wooded shores with an outer fringe of flowering bushes sweep onward
in beautiful curves around bays and capes and jutting promontories
innumerable while the islands with soft waving outlines lavishly
adorned with spruces and cedars thicken and enrich the beauty of the
waters and the white spirit mountains looking down from the sky keep
watch and ward over all faithful and changeless as the stars

all the way from the strait of juan de fuca up to olympia a hopeful
town situated at the head of one of the farthest-reaching of the fingers
of the sound we are so completely inland and surrounded by mountains
that it is hard to realize that we are sailing on a branch of the
salt sea we are constantly reminded of lake tahoe there is the same
clearness of the water in calm weather without any trace of the ocean
swell the same picturesque winding and sculpture of the shoreline and
flowery leafy luxuriance only here the trees are taller and stand much
closer together and the backgrounds are higher and far more extensive
here too we find greater variety amid the marvelous wealth of islands
and inlets and also in the changing views dependent on the weather
as we double cape after cape and round the uncounted islands new
combinations come to view in endless variety sufficient to fill and
satisfy the lover of wild beauty through a whole life

oftentimes in the stillest weather when all the winds sleep and no sign
of storms is felt or seen silky clouds form and settle over all the
land leaving in sight only a circle of water with indefinite bounds
like views in mid-ocean then the clouds lifting some islet will be
presented standing alone with the tops of its trees dipping out of
sight in pearly gray fringes or lifting higher and perhaps letting in
a ray of sunshine through some rift overhead the whole island will be
set free and brought forward in vivid relief amid the gloom a girdle of
silver light of dazzling brightness on the water about its shores then
darkening again and vanishing back into the general gloom thus island
after island may be seen singly or in groups coming and going from
darkness to light like a scene of enchantment until at length the
entire cloud ceiling is rolled away and the colossal cone of mount
rainier is seen in spotless white looking down over the forests from
a distance of sixty miles but so lofty and so massive and clearly
outlined as to impress itself upon us as being just back of a strip of
woods only a mile or two in breadth

for the tourist sailing to puget sound from san francisco there is but
little that is at all striking in the scenery within reach by the way
until the mouth of the strait of juan de fuca is reached the voyage
is about four days in length and the steamers keep within sight of the
coast but the hills fronting the sea up to oregon are mostly bare
and uninviting the magnificent redwood forests stretching along this
portion of the california coast seeming to keep well back away from
the heavy winds so that very little is seen of them while there are
no deep inlets or lofty mountains visible to break the regular monotony
along the coast of oregon the woods of spruce and fir come down to the
shore kept fresh and vigorous by copious rains and become denser and
taller to the northward until rounding cape flattery we enter the
strait of fuca where sheltered from the ocean gales the forests begin
to hint the grandeur they attain in puget sound here the scenery in
general becomes exceedingly interesting for now we have arrived at the
grand mountain-walled channel that forms the entrance to that marvelous
network of inland waters that extends along the margin of the continent
to the northward for a thousand miles

this magnificent inlet was named for juan de fuca who discovered it in
1592 while seeking a mythical strait supposed to exist somewhere in the
north connecting the atlantic and pacific it is about seventy miles
long ten or twelve miles wide and extends to the eastward in a nearly
straight line between the south end of vancouver island and the olympic
range of mountains on the mainland

cape flattery the western termination of the olympic range is terribly
rugged and jagged and in stormy weather is utterly inaccessible from
the sea then the ponderous rollers of the deep pacific thunder amid
its caverns and cliffs with the foam and uproar of a thousand yosemite
waterfalls the bones of many a noble ship lie there and many a sailor
it would seem unlikely that any living thing should seek rest in such a
place or find it nevertheless frail and delicate flowers bloom there
flowers of both the land and the sea heavy ungainly seals disport in
the swelling waves and find grateful retreats back in the inmost bores
of its storm-lashed caverns while in many a chink and hollow of the
highest crags not visible from beneath a great variety of waterfowl
make homes and rear their young

but not always are the inhabitants safe even in such wave-defended
castles as these for the indians of the neighboring shores venture
forth in the calmest summer weather in their frail canoes to spear
the seals in the narrow gorges amid the grinding gurgling din of the
restless waters at such times also the hunters make out to scale many
of the apparently inaccessible cliffs for the eggs and young of the
gulls and other water birds occasionally losing their lives in these
perilous adventures which give rise to many an exciting story told
around the campfires at night when the storms roar loudest

passing through the strait we have the olympic mountains close at hand
on the right vancouver island on the left and the snowy peak of mount
baker straight ahead in the distance during calm weather or when the
clouds are lifting and rolling off the mountains after a storm all
these views are truly magnificent mount baker is one of that wonderful
series of old volcanoes that once flamed along the summits of the
sierras and cascades from lassen to mount st elias its fires are
sleeping now and it is loaded with glaciers streams of ice having
taken the place of streams of glowing lava vancouver island presents a
charming variety of hill and dale open sunny spaces and sweeps of dark
forest rising in swell beyond swell to the high land in the distance

but the olympic mountains most of all command attention seen tellingly
near and clear in all their glory rising from the water's edge into the
sky to a height of six or eight thousand feet they bound the strait on
the south side throughout its whole extent forming a massive sustained
wall flowery and bushy at the base a zigzag of snowy peaks along
the top which have ragged-edged fields of ice and snow beneath them
enclosed in wide amphitheaters opening to the waters of the strait
through spacious forest-filled valleys enlivened with fine dashing
streams these valleys mark the courses of the olympic glaciers at the
period of their greatest extension when they poured their tribute into
that portion of the great northern ice sheet that overswept the south
end of vancouver island and filled the strait with flowing ice as it is
now filled with ocean water

the steamers of the sound usually stop at esquimalt on their way up
thus affording tourists an opportunity to visit the interesting town of
victoria the capital of british columbia the victoria harbor is too
narrow and difficult of access for the larger class of ships therefore
a landing has to be made at esquimalt the distance however is only
about three miles and the way is delightful winding on through a
charming forest of douglas spruce with here and there groves of oak
and madrone and a rich undergrowth of hazel dogwood willow alder
spiraea rubus huckleberry and wild rose pretty cottages occur
at intervals along the road covered with honeysuckle and many an
upswelling rock freshly glaciated and furred with yellow mosses and
lichen telling interesting stories of the icy past

victoria is a quiet handsome breezy town beautifully located on
finely modulated ground at the mouth of the canal de haro with charming
views in front of islands and mountains and far-reaching waters ever
changing in the shifting lights and shades of the clouds and sunshine
in the background there are a mile or two of field and forest and sunny
oak openings then comes the forest primeval dense and shaggy and
well-nigh impenetrable

notwithstanding the importance claimed for victoria as a commercial
center and the capital of british columbia it has a rather young
loose-jointed appearance the government buildings and some of the
business blocks on the main streets are well built and imposing in bulk
and architecture these are far less interesting and characteristic
however than the mansions set in the midst of spacious pleasure grounds
and the lovely home cottages embowered in honeysuckle and climbing
roses one soon discovers that this is no yankee town the english
faces and the way that english is spoken alone would tell that while in
business quarters there is a staid dignity and moderation that is very
noticeable and a want of american push and hurrah love of land and of
privacy in homes is made manifest in the residences many of which are
built in the middle of fields and orchards or large city blocks and in
the loving care with which these home grounds are planted they are very
beautiful the fineness of the climate with its copious measure of warm
moisture distilling in dew and fog and gentle bathing laving rain
give them a freshness and floweriness that is worth going far to see

victoria is noted for its fine drives and every one who can should
either walk or drive around the outskirts of the town not only for the
fine views out over the water but to see the cascades of bloom pouring
over the gables of the cottages and the fresh wild woods with their
flowery fragrant underbrush wild roses abound almost everywhere one
species blooming freely along the woodland paths is from two to three
inches in diameter and more fragrant than any other wild rose i ever
saw excepting the sweetbriar this rose and three species of spiraea
fairly fill the air with fragrance after a shower and how brightly then
do the red berries of the dogwood shine out from the warm yellow-green
of leaves and mosses

but still more interesting and significant are the glacial phenomena
displayed hereabouts all this exuberant tree bush and herbaceous
vegetation cultivated or wild is growing upon moraine beds outspread
by waters that issued from the ancient glaciers at the time of
their recession and scarcely at all moved or in any way modified by
post-glacial agencies the town streets and the roads are graded in
moraine material among scratched and grooved rock bosses that are as
unweathered and telling as any to be found in the glacier channels of
alaska the harbor also is clearly of glacial origin the rock islets
that rise here and there forming so marked a feature of the harbor are
unchanged roches moutonnees and the shores are grooved scratched and
rounded and in every way as glacial in all their characteristics as
those of a newborn glacial lake

most visitors to victoria go to the stores of the hudson's bay company
presumably on account of the romantic associations or to purchase a
bit of fur or some other wild-indianish trinket as a memento at certain
seasons of the year when the hairy harvests are gathered in immense
bales of skins may be seen in these unsavory warehouses the spoils of
many thousand hunts over mountain and plain by lonely river and shore
the skins of bears wolves beavers otters fishers martens lynxes
panthers wolverine reindeer moose elk wild goats sheep foxes
squirrels and many others of our "poor earth-born companions and fellow
mortals" may here be found

vancouver is the southmost and the largest of the countless islands
forming the great archipelago that stretches a thousand miles to the
northward its shores have been known a long time but little is known
of the lofty mountainous interior on account of the difficulties in
the way of explorations lake bogs and shaggy tangled forests it is
mostly a pure savage wilderness without roads or clearings and silent
so far as man is concerned even the indians keep close to the shore
getting a living by fishing dwelling together in villages and
traveling almost wholly by canoes white settlements are few and far
between good agricultural lands occur here and there on the edge of
the wilderness but they are hard to clear and have received but little
attention thus far gold the grand attraction that lights the way into
all kinds of wildernesses and makes rough places smooth has been found
but only in small quantities too small to make much motion almost all
the industry of the island is employed upon lumber and coal in which
so far as known its chief wealth lies

leaving victoria for port townsend after we are fairly out on the free
open water mount baker is seen rising solitary over a dark breadth of
forest making a glorious show in its pure white raiment it is said
to be about eleven thousand feet high is loaded with glaciers some of
which come well down into the woods and never so far as i have heard
has been climbed though in all probability it is not inaccessible
the task of reaching its base through the dense woods will be likely to
prove of greater difficulty than the climb to the summit

in a direction a little to the left of mount baker and much nearer
may be seen the island of san juan famous in the young history of the
country for the quarrels concerning its rightful ownership between the
hudson's bay company and washington territory quarrels which nearly
brought on war with great britain neither party showed any lack of
either pluck or gunpowder general scott was sent out by president
buchanan to negotiate which resulted in a joint occupancy of the
island small quarrels however continued to arise until the year 1874
when the peppery question was submitted to the emperor of germany for
arbitration then the whole island was given to the united states

san juan is one of a thickset cluster of islands that fills the waters
between vancouver and the mainland a little to the north of victoria
in some of the intricate channels between these islands the tides run
at times like impetuous rushing rivers rendering navigation rather
uncertain and dangerous for the small sailing vessels that ply between
victoria and the settlements on the coast of british columbia and the
larger islands the water is generally deep enough everywhere too deep
in most places for anchorage and the winds shifting hither and thither
or dying away altogether the ships getting no direction from their
helms are carried back and forth or are caught in some eddy where two
currents meet and whirled round and round to the dismay of the sailors
like a chip in a river whirlpool

all the way over to port townsend the olympic mountains well maintain
their massive imposing grandeur and present their elaborately carved
summits in clear relief many of which are out of sight in coming up the
strait on account of our being too near the base of the range turn to
them as often as we may our admiration only grows the warmer the longer
we dwell upon them the highest peaks are mount constance and mount
olympus said to be about eight thousand feet high

in two or three hours after leaving victoria we arrive at the handsome
little town of port townsend situated at the mouth of puget sound on
the west side the residential portion of the town is set on the level
top of the bluff that bounds port townsend bay while another nearly
level space of moderate extent reaching from the base of the bluff to
the shoreline is occupied by the business portion thus making a town
of two separate and distinct stories which are connected by long
ladder-like flights of stairs in the streets of the lower story while
there is no lack of animation there is but little business noise as
compared with the amount of business transacted this in great part is
due to the scarcity of horses and wagons farms and roads back in the
woods are few and far between nearly all the tributary settlements are
on the coast and communication is almost wholly by boats canoes and
schooners hence country stages and farmers' wagons and buggies with
the whir and din that belong to them are wanting

this being the port of entry all vessels have to stop here and they
make a lively show about the wharves and in the bay the winds stir the
flags of every civilized nation while the indians in their long-beaked
canoes glide about from ship to ship satisfying their curiosity or
trading with the crews keen traders these indians are and few indeed
of the sailors or merchants from any country ever get the better of them
in bargains curious groups of people may often be seen in the
streets and stores made up of english french spanish portuguese
scandinavians germans greeks moors japanese and chinese of every
rank and station and style of dress and behavior settlers from many
a nook and bay and island up and down the coast hunters from the
wilderness tourists on their way home by the sound and the columbia
river or to alaska or california

the upper story of port townsend is charmingly located wide bright
waters on one side flowing evergreen woods on the other the streets
are well laid out and well tended and the houses with their luxuriant
gardens about them have an air of taste and refinement seldom found
in towns set on the edge of a wild forest the people seem to have
come here to make true homes attracted by the beauty and fresh breezy
healthfulness of the place as well as by business advantages trusting
to natural growth and advancement instead of restless "booming" methods
they perhaps have caught some of the spirit of calm moderation and
enjoyment from their english neighbors across the water of late
however this sober tranquillity has begun to give way some whiffs from
the whirlwind of real estate speculation up the sound having at length
touched the town and ruffled the surface of its calmness

a few miles up the bay is fort townsend which makes a pretty picture
with the green woods rising back of it and the calm water in front
across the mouth of the sound lies the long narrow whidbey island
named by vancouver for one of his lieutenants it is about thirty miles
in length and is remarkable in this region of crowded forests and
mountains as being comparatively open and low the soil is good and
easily worked and a considerable portion of the island has been under
cultivation for many years fertile fields open parklike groves of
oak and thick masses of evergreens succeed one another in charming
combinations to make this "the garden spot of the territory"

leaving port townsend for seattle and tacoma we enter the sound and
sail down into the heart of the green aspiring forests and find look
where we may beauty ever changing in lavish profusion puget sound
"the mediterranean of america" as it is sometimes called is in many
respects one of the most remarkable bodies of water in the world
vancouver who came here nearly a hundred years ago and made a careful
survey of it named the larger northern portion of it "admiralty inlet"
and one of the long narrow branches "hood's canal'" applying the name
"puget sound" only to the comparatively small southern portion the
latter name however is now applied generally to the entire inlet
and is commonly shortened by the people hereabouts to "the sound"
the natural wealth and commercial advantages of the sound region were
quickly recognized and the cause of the activity prevailing here is not
far to seek vancouver long before civilization touched these shores
spoke of it in terms of unstinted praise he was sent out by the british
government with the principal object in view of "acquiring accurate
knowledge as to the nature and extent of any water communication which
may tend in any considerable degree to facilitate an intercourse for the
purposes of commerce between the northwest coast and the country on
the opposite side of the continent" vague traditions having long been
current concerning a strait supposed to unite the two oceans vancouver
reported that he found the coast from san francisco to oregon and beyond
to present a nearly straight solid barrier to the sea without openings
and we may well guess the joy of the old navigator on the discovery of
these waters after so long and barren a search to the southward

his descriptions of the scenery mounts baker rainier st helen's
etc were as enthusiastic as those of the most eager landscape lover of
the present day when scenery is in fashion he says in one place "to
describe the beauties of this region will on some future occasion be a
very grateful task for the pen of a skillful panegyrist the serenity
of the climate the immeasurable pleasing landscapes and the abundant
fertility that unassisted nature puts forth require only to be enriched
by the industry of man with villages mansions cottages and other
buildings to render it the most lovely country that can be imagined
the labor of the inhabitants would be amply rewarded in the bounties
which nature seems ready to bestow on cultivation" "a picture so
pleasing could not fail to call to our remembrance certain delightful
and beloved situations in old england" so warm indeed were the
praises he sung that his statements were received in england with a
good deal of hesitation but they were amply corroborated by wilkes
and others who followed many years later "nothing" says wilkes "can
exceed the beauty of these waters and their safety not a shoal exists
in the straits of juan de fuca admiralty inlet puget sound or hood's
canal that can in any way interrupt their navigation by a 74-gun
ship i venture nothing in saying there is no country in the world that
possesses waters like these" and again quoting from the united states
coast survey "for depth of water boldness of approaches freedom from
hidden dangers and the immeasurable sea of gigantic timber coming down
to the very shores these waters are unsurpassed unapproachable"

the sound region has a fine fresh clean climate well washed both
winter and summer with copious rains and swept with winds and clouds
that come from the mountains and the sea every hidden nook in the
depths of the woods is searched and refreshed leaving no stagnant air
beaver meadows and lake basin and low and willowy bogs all are kept
wholesome and sweet the year round cloud and sunshine alternate in
bracing cheering succession and health and abundance follow the
storms the outer sea margin is sublimely dashed and drenched with ocean
brine the spicy scud sweeping at times far inland over the bending
woods the giant trees waving and chanting in hearty accord as if surely
enjoying it all

heavy long-continued rains occur in the winter months then every leaf
bathed and brightened rejoices filtering drops and currents through
all the shaggy undergrowth of the woods go with tribute to the small
streams and these again to the larger the rivers swell but there are
no devastating floods for the thick felt of roots and mosses holds
the abounding waters in check stored in a thousand thousand fountains
neither are there any violent hurricanes here at least i never have
heard of any nor have i come upon their tracks most of the streams are
clear and cool always for their waters are filtered through deep beds
of mosses and flow beneath shadows all the way to the sea only the
streams from the glaciers are turbid and muddy on the slopes of the
mountains where they rush from their crystal caves they carry not
only small particles of rock-mud worn off the sides and bottoms of
the channels of the glaciers but grains of sand and pebbles and large
boulders tons in weight rolling them forward on their way rumbling and
bumping to their appointed places at the foot of steep slopes to be
built into rough bars and beds while the smaller material is carried
farther and outspread in flats perhaps for coming wheat fields and
gardens the finest of it going out to sea floating on the tides for
weeks and months ere it finds rest on the bottom

snow seldom falls to any great depth on the lowlands though it comes in
glorious abundance on the mountains and only on the mountains does the
temperature fall much below the freezing point in the warmest summer
weather a temperature of eighty-five degrees or even more occasionally
is reached but not for long at a time as such heat is speedily
followed by a breeze from the sea the most charming days here are days
of perfect calm when all the winds are holding their breath and not a
leaf stirs the surface of the sound shines like a silver mirror over
all its vast extent reflecting its lovely islands and shores and long
sheets of spangles flash and dance in the wake of every swimming
seabird and boat the sun looking down on the tranquil landscape seems
conscious of the presence of every living thing on which he is pouring
his blessings while they in turn with perhaps the exception of man
seem conscious of the sun as a benevolent father and stand hushed and
waiting




xviii the forests of washington


when we force our way into the depths of the forests following any of
the rivers back to their fountains we find that the bulk of the woods
is made up of the douglas spruce (pseudotsuga douglasii) named in honor
of david douglas an enthusiastic botanical explorer of early hudson's
bay times it is not only a very large tree but a very beautiful one
with lively bright-green drooping foliage handsome pendent cones and
a shaft exquisitely straight and regular for so large a tree it is
astonishing how many find nourishment and space to grow on any given
area the magnificent shafts push their spires into the sky close
together with as regular a growth as that of a well-tilled field of
grain and no ground has been better tilled for the growth of trees
than that on which these forests are growing for it has been thoroughly
ploughed and rolled by the mighty glaciers from the mountains and
sifted and mellowed and outspread in beds hundreds of feet in depth by
the broad streams that issued from their fronts at the time of their
recession after they had long covered all the land

the largest tree of this species that i have myself measured was nearly
twelve feet in diameter at a height of five feet from the ground and
as near as i could make out under the circumstances about three
hundred feet in length it stood near the head of the sound not far from
olympia i have seen a few others both near the coast and thirty or
forty miles back in the interior that were from eight to ten feet in
diameter measured above their bulging insteps and many from six to
seven feet i have heard of some that were said to be three hundred and
twenty-five feet in height and fifteen feet in diameter but none that
i measured were so large though it is not at all unlikely that such
colossal giants do exist where conditions of soil and exposure are
surpassingly favorable the average size of all the trees of this
species found up to an elevation on the mountain slopes of say two
thousand feet above sea level taking into account only what may be
called mature trees two hundred and fifty to five hundred years of age
is perhaps at a vague guess not more than a height of one hundred and
seventy-five or two hundred feet and a diameter of three feet though
of course throughout the richest sections the size is much greater

in proportion to its weight when dry the timber from this tree is
perhaps stronger than that of any other conifer in the country it is
tough and durable and admirably adapted in every way for shipbuilding
piles and heavy timbers in general but its hardness and liability to
warp render it much inferior to white or sugar pine for fine work in
the lumber markets of california it is known as "oregon pine" and is
used almost exclusively for spars bridge timbers heavy planking and
the framework of houses

the same species extends northward in abundance through british columbia
and southward through the coast and middle regions of oregon and
california it is also a common tree in the canyons and hollows of
the wahsatch mountains in utah where it is called "red pine" and on
portions of the rocky mountains and some of the short ranges of the
great basin along the coast of california it keeps company with the
redwood wherever it can find a favorable opening on the western slope
of the sierra with the yellow pine and incense cedar it forms a pretty
well-defined belt at a height of from three thousand to six thousand
feet above the sea and extends into the san gabriel and san bernardino
mountains in southern california but though widely distributed it
is only in these cool moist northlands that it reaches its finest
development tall straight elastic and free from limbs to an immense
height growing down to tide water where ships of the largest size may
lie close alongside and load at the least possible cost

growing with the douglas we find the white spruce or "sitka pine" as
it is sometimes called this also is a very beautiful and majestic tree
frequently attaining a height of two hundred feet or more and a diameter
of five or six feet it is very abundant in southeastern alaska forming
the greater part of the best forests there here it is found mostly
around the sides of beaver-dam and other meadows and on the borders of
the streams especially where the ground is low one tree that i saw
felled at the head of the hop-ranch meadows on the upper snoqualmie
river though far from being the largest i have seen measured a hundred
and eighty feet in length and four and a half in diameter and was two
hundred and fifty-seven years of age

in habit and general appearance it resembles the douglas spruce but it
is somewhat less slender and the needles grow close together all
around the branchlets and are so stiff and sharp-pointed on the younger
branches that they cannot well be handled without gloves the timber is
tough close-grained white and looks more like pine than any other of
the spruces it splits freely makes excellent shingles and in general
use in house-building takes the place of pine i have seen logs of this
species a hundred feet long and two feet in diameter at the upper end
it was named in honor of the old scotch botanist archibald menzies who
came to this coast with vancouver in 1792 [23]

the beautiful hemlock spruce with its warm yellow-green foliage is
also common in some portions of these woods it is tall and slender and
exceedingly graceful in habit before old age comes on but the timber is
inferior and is seldom used for any other than the roughest work such
as wharf-building

the western arbor-vitae [24] (thuja gigantea) grows to a size truly
gigantic on low rich ground specimens ten feet in diameter and a
hundred and forty feet high are not at all rare some that i have heard
of are said to be fifteen and even eighteen feet thick clad in rich
glossy plumes with gray lichens covering their smooth tapering boles
perfect trees of this species are truly noble objects and well worthy
the place they hold in these glorious forests it is of this tree that
the indians make their fine canoes

of the other conifers that are so happy as to have place here there
are three firs three or four pines two cypresses a yew and another
spruce the abies pattoniana [25] this last is perhaps the most
beautiful of all the spruces but being comparatively small and growing
only far back on the mountains it receives but little attention from
most people nor is there room in a work like this for anything like a
complete description of it or of the others i have just mentioned of
the three firs one (picea grandis) [26] grows near the coast and is
one of the largest trees in the forest sometimes attaining a height of
two hundred and fifty feet the timber however is inferior in quality
and not much sought after while so much that is better is within reach
one of the others (p amabilis var nobilis) forms magnificent forests
by itself at a height of about three thousand to four thousand feet
above the sea the rich plushy plumelike branches grow in regular
whorls around the trunk and on the topmost whorls standing erect are
the large beautiful cones this is far the most beautiful of all the
firs in the sierra nevada it forms a considerable portion of the main
forest belt on the western slope and it is there that it reaches its
greatest size and greatest beauty the third species (p subalpina)
forms together with abies pattoniana the upper edge of the timberline
on the portion of the cascades opposite the sound a thousand feet below
the extreme limit of tree growth it occurs in beautiful groups amid
parklike openings where flowers grow in extravagant profusion

the pines are nowhere abundant in the state the largest the yellow
pine (pinus ponderosa) occurs here and there on margins of dry gravelly
prairies and only in such situations have i yet seen it in this state
the others (p monticola and p contorta) are mostly restricted to
the upper slopes of the mountains and though the former of these two
attains a good size and makes excellent lumber it is mostly beyond
reach at present and is not abundant one of the cypresses (cupressus
lawsoniana) [27] grows near the coast and is a fine large tree clothed
like the arbor-vitae in a glorious wealth of flat feathery branches
the other is found here and there well up toward the edge of the
timberline this is the fine alaska cedar (c nootkatensis) the lumber
from which is noted for its durability fineness of grain and beautiful
yellow color and for its fragrance which resembles that of sandalwood
the alaska indians make their canoe paddles of it and weave matting and
coarse cloth from the fibrous brown bark

among the different kinds of hardwood trees are the oak maple madrona
birch alder and wild apple while large cottonwoods are common along
the rivers and shores of the numerous lakes

the most striking of these to the traveler is the menzies arbutus or
madrona as it is popularly called in california its curious red and
yellow bark large thick glossy leaves and panicles of waxy-looking
greenish-white urn-shaped flowers render it very conspicuous on the
boles of the younger trees and on all the branches the bark is so
smooth and seamless that it does not appear as bark at all but rather
the naked wood the whole tree with the exception of the larger part
of the trunk looks as though it had been thoroughly peeled it is found
sparsely scattered along the shores of the sound and back in the forests
also on open margins where the soil is not too wet and extends up the
coast on vancouver island beyond nanaimo but in no part of the state
does it reach anything like the size and beauty of proportions that
it attains in california few trees here being more than ten or
twelve inches in diameter and thirty feet high it is however a very
remarkable-looking object standing there like some lost or runaway
native of the tropics naked and painted beside that dark mossy ocean
of northland conifers not even a palm tree would seem more out of place
here

the oaks so far as my observation has reached seem to be most
abundant and to grow largest on the islands of the san juan and whidbey
archipelago one of the three species of maples that i have seen is only
a bush that makes tangles on the banks of the rivers of the other two
one is a small tree crooked and moss-grown holding out its leaves to
catch the light that filters down through the close-set spires of the
great spruces it grows almost everywhere throughout the entire extent
of the forest until the higher slopes of the mountains are reached
and produces a very picturesque and delightful effect relieving the
bareness of the great shafts of the evergreens without being close
enough in its growth to hide them wholly or to cover the bright mossy
carpet that is spread beneath all the dense parts of the woods

the other species is also very picturesque and at the same time very
large the largest tree of its kind that i have ever seen anywhere
not even in the great maple woods of canada have i seen trees either
as large or with so much striking picturesque character it is widely
distributed throughout western washington but is never found scattered
among the conifers in the dense woods it keeps together mostly in
magnificent groves by itself on the damp levels along the banks of
streams or lakes where the ground is subject to overflow in such
situations it attains a height of seventy-five to a hundred feet and a
diameter of four to eight feet the trunk sends out large limbs toward
its neighbors laden with long drooping mosses beneath and rows of ferns
on their upper surfaces thus making a grand series of richly ornamented
interlacing arches with the leaves laid thick overhead rendering the
underwood spaces delightfully cool and open never have i seen a finer
forest ceiling or a more picturesque one while the floor covered with
tall ferns and rubus and thrown into hillocks by the bulging roots
matches it well the largest of these maple groves that i have yet found
is on the right bank of the snoqualmie river about a mile above the
falls the whole country hereabouts is picturesque and interesting in
many ways and well worthy a visit by tourists passing through the sound
region since it is now accessible by rail from seattle

looking now at the forests in a comprehensive way we find in passing
through them again and again from the shores of the sound to their upper
limits that some portions are much older than others the trees much
larger and the ground beneath them strewn with immense trunks in every
stage of decay representing several generations of growth everything
about them giving the impression that these are indeed the "forests
primeval" while in the younger portions where the elevation of the
ground is the same as to the sea level and the species of trees are the
same as well as the quality of the soil apart from the moisture which
it holds the trees seem to be and are mostly of the same age perhaps
from one hundred to two or three hundred years with no gray-bearded
venerable patriarchs forming tall majestic woods without any
grandfathers

when we examine the ground we find that it is as free from those mounds
of brown crumbling wood and mossy ancient fragments as are the growing
trees from very old ones then perchance we come upon a section farther
up the slopes towards the mountains that has no trees more than fifty
years old or even fifteen or twenty years old these last show plainly
enough that they have been devastated by fire as the black melancholy
monuments rising here and there above the young growth bear witness
then with this fiery suggestive testimony on examining those sections
whose trees are a hundred years old or two hundred we find the same
fire records though heavily veiled with mosses and lichens showing
that a century or two ago the forests that stood there had been swept
away in some tremendous fire at a time when rare conditions of drouth
made their burning possible then the bare ground sprinkled with the
winged seed from the edges of the burned district a new forest sprang
up nearly every tree starting at the same time or within a few years
thus producing the uniformity of size we find in such places while on
the other hand in those sections of ancient aspect containing very old
trees both standing and fallen we find no traces of fire nor from the
extreme dampness of the ground can we see any possibility of fire ever
running there

fire then is the great governing agent in forest distribution and to
a great extent also in the conditions of forest growth where fertile
lands are very wet one half the year and very dry the other there can
be no forests at all where the ground is damp with drouth occurring
only at intervals of centuries fine forests may be found other
conditions being favorable but it is only where fires never run that
truly ancient forests of pitchy coniferous trees may exist when the
washington forests are seen from the deck of a ship out in the middle of
the sound or even from the top of some high commanding mountain
the woods seem everywhere perfectly solid and so in fact they are in
general found to be the largest openings are those of the lakes and
prairies the smaller of beaver meadows bogs and the rivers none of
them large enough to make a distinct mark in comprehensive views

of the lakes there are said to be some thirty in king's county alone
the largest lake washington being twenty-six miles long and four miles
wide another which enjoys the duckish name of lake squak is about
ten miles long both are pure and beautiful lying imbedded in the green
wilderness the rivers are numerous and are but little affected by the
weather flowing with deep steady currents the year round they are
short however none of them drawing their sources from beyond the
cascade range some are navigable for small steamers on their lower
courses but the openings they make in the woods are very narrow the
tall trees on their banks leaning over in some places making fine shady
tunnels

the largest of the prairies that i have seen lies to the south of tacoma
on the line of the portland and tacoma railroad the ground is dry and
gravelly a deposit of water-washed cobbles and pebbles derived from
moraines conditions which readily explain the absence of trees here and
on other prairies adjacent to yelm berries grow in lavish abundance
enough for man and beast with thousands of tons to spare the woods are
full of them especially about the borders of the waters and meadows
where the sunshine may enter nowhere in the north does nature set a
more bountiful table there are huckleberries of many species red
blue and black some of them growing close to the ground others on
bushes eight to ten feet high also salal berries growing on a low
weak-stemmed bush a species of gaultheria seldom more than a foot or
two high this has pale pea-green glossy leaves two or three inches long
and half an inch wide and beautiful pink flowers urn-shaped that
make a fine rich show the berries are black when ripe are extremely
abundant and with the huckleberries form an important part of the
food of the indians who beat them into paste dry them and store them
away for winter use to be eaten with their oily fish the salmon-berry
also is very plentiful growing in dense prickly tangles the flowers
are as large as wild roses and of the same color and the berries
measure nearly an inch in diameter besides these there are
gooseberries currants raspberries blackberries and in some favored
spots strawberries the mass of the underbrush of the woods is made
up in great part of these berry-bearing bushes together with
white-flowered spiraea twenty feet high hazel dogwood wild rose
honeysuckle symphoricarpus etc but in the depths of the woods where
little sunshine can reach the ground there is but little underbrush of
any kind only a very light growth of huckleberry and rubus and young
maples in most places the difficulties encountered by the explorer in
penetrating the wilderness are presented mostly by the streams and bogs
with their tangled margins and the fallen timber and thick carpet of
moss covering all the ground

notwithstanding the tremendous energy displayed in lumbering and the
grand scale on which it is being carried on and the number of settlers
pushing into every opening in search of farmlands the woods of
washington are still almost entirely virgin and wild without trace of
human touch savage or civilized indians no doubt have ascended most
of the rivers on their way to the mountains to hunt the wild sheep and
goat to obtain wool for their clothing but with food in abundance on
the coast they had little to tempt them into the wilderness and the
monuments they have left in it are scarcely more conspicuous than those
of squirrels and bears far less so than those of the beavers which in
damming the streams have made clearings and meadows which will continue
to mark the landscape for centuries nor is there much in these woods to
tempt the farmer or cattle raiser a few settlers established homes
on the prairies or open borders of the woods and in the valleys of the
chehalis and cowlitz before the gold days of california most of the
early immigrants from the eastern states however settled in the
fertile and open willamette valley or oregon even now when the search
for land is so keen with the exception of the bottom lands around the
sound and on the lower reaches of the rivers there are comparatively
few spots of cultivation in western washington on every meadow or
opening of any kind some one will be found keeping cattle planting hop
vines or raising hay vegetables and patches of grain all the large
spaces available even back near the summits of the cascade mountains
were occupied long ago the newcomers building their cabins where the
beavers once built theirs keep a few cows and industriously seek to
enlarge their small meadow patches by chopping girdling and burning
the edge of the encircling forest gnawing like beavers and scratching
for a living among the blackened stumps and logs regarding the trees
as their greatest enemies a sort of larger pernicious weed immensely
difficult to get rid of

but all these are as yet mere spots making no visible scar in the
distance and leaving the grand stretches of the forest as wild as they
were before the discovery of the continent for many years the axe has
been busy around the shores of the sound and ships have been falling in
perpetual storm like flakes of snow the best of the timber has been
cut for a distance of eight or ten miles from the water and to a much
greater distance along the streams deep enough to float the logs
railroads too have been built to fetch in the logs from the best
bodies of timber otherwise inaccessible except at great cost none of
the ground however has been completely denuded most of the young
trees have been left together with the hemlocks and other trees
undesirable in kind or in some way defective so that the neighboring
trees appear to have closed over the gaps make by the removal of the
larger and better ones maintaining the general continuity of the forest
and leaving no sign on the sylvan sea at least as seen from a distance

in felling the trees they cut them off usually at a height of six to
twelve feet above the ground so as to avoid cutting through the swollen
base where the diameter is so much greater in order to reach this
height the chopper cuts a notch about two inches wide and three or four
deep and drives a board into it on which he stands while at work in
case the first notch cut as high as he can reach is not high enough
he stands on the board that has been driven into the first notch and
cuts another thus the axeman may often be seen at work standing eight
or ten feet above the ground if the tree is so large that with his
long-handled axe the chopper is unable to reach to the farther side of
it then a second chopper is set to work each cutting halfway across
and when the tree is about to fall warned by the faint crackling of the
strained fibers they jump to the ground and stand back out of danger
from flying limbs while the noble giant that had stood erect in
glorious strength and beauty century after century bows low at last and
with gasp and groan and booming throb falls to earth

then with long saws the trees are cut into logs of the required length
peeled loaded upon wagons capable of carrying a weight of eight or ten
tons hauled by a long string of oxen to the nearest available stream
or railroad and floated or carried to the sound there the logs are
gathered into booms and towed by steamers to the mills where workmen
with steel spikes in their boots leap lightly with easy poise from
one to another and by means of long pike poles push them apart and
selecting such as are at the time required push them to the foot of a
chute and drive dogs into the ends when they are speedily hauled in by
the mill machinery alongside the saw carriage and placed and fixed
in position then with sounds of greedy hissing and growling they are
rushed back and forth like enormous shuttles and in an incredibly short
time they are lumber and are aboard the ships lying at the mill wharves

many of the long slender boles so abundant in these woods are saved
for spars and so excellent is their quality that they are in demand
in almost every shipyard of the world thus these trees felled and
stripped of their leaves and branches are raised again transplanted
and set firmly erect given roots of iron and a new foliage of flapping
canvas and sent to sea on they speed in glad free motion cheerily
waving over the blue heaving water responsive to the same winds that
rocked them when they stood at home in the woods after standing in one
place all their lives they now like sight-seeing tourists go round
the world meeting many a relative from the old home forest some like
themselves wandering free clad in broad canvas foliage others planted
head downward in mud holding wharf platforms aloft to receive the wares
of all nations

the mills of puget sound and those of the redwood region of california
are said to be the largest and most effective lumber-makers in the
world tacoma alone claims to have eleven sawmills and seattle about as
many while at many other points on the sound where the conditions are
particularly favorable there are immense lumbering establishments
as at ports blakely madison discovery gamble ludlow etc with a
capacity all together of over three million feet a day nevertheless
the observer coming up the sound sees not nor hears anything of this
fierce storm of steel that is devouring the forests save perhaps the
shriek of some whistle or the columns of smoke that mark the position of
the mills all else seems as serene and unscathed as the silent watching
mountains




xix people and towns of puget sound


as one strolls in the woods about the logging camps most of the
lumbermen are found to be interesting people to meet kind and obliging
and sincere full of knowledge concerning the bark and sapwood
and heartwood of the trees they cut and how to fell them without
unnecessary breakage on ground where they may be most advantageously
sawed into logs and loaded for removal the work is hard and all of
the older men have a tired somewhat haggard appearance their faces are
doubtful in color neither sickly nor quite healthy-looking and seamed
with deep wrinkles like the bark of the spruces but with no trace of
anxiety their clothing is full of rosin and never wears out a little
of everything in the woods is stuck fast to these loggers and their
trousers grow constantly thicker with age in all their movements and
gestures they are heavy and deliberate like the trees above them and
they walk with a swaying rocking gait altogether free from quick jerky
fussiness for chopping and log rolling have quenched all that they are
also slow of speech as if partly out of breath and when one tries
to draw them out on some subject away from logs all the fresh leafy
outreaching branches of the mind seem to have been withered and killed
with fatigue leaving their lives little more than dry lumber many a
tree have these old axemen felled but round-shouldered and stooping
they too are beginning to lean over many of their companions are
already beneath the moss and among those that we see at work some are
now dead at the top (bald) leafless so to speak and tottering to
their fall

a very different man seen now and then at long intervals but usually
invisible is the free roamer of the wilderness hunter prospector
explorer seeking he knows not what lithe and sinewy he walks erect
making his way with the skill of wild animals all his senses in
action watchful and alert looking keenly at everything in sight his
imagination well nourished in the wealth of the wilderness coming into
contact with free nature in a thousand forms drinking at the fountains
of things responsive to wild influences as trees to the winds well
he knows the wild animals his neighbors what fishes are in the streams
what birds in the forests and where food may be found hungry at times
and weary he has corresponding enjoyment in eating and resting and all
the wilderness is home some of these rare happy rovers die alone among
the leaves others half settle down and change in part into farmers
each making choice of some fertile spot where the landscape attracts
him builds a small cabin where with few wants to supply from garden
or field he hunts and farms in turn going perhaps once a year to the
settlements until night begins to draw near and like forest shadows
thickens into darkness and his day is done in these washington
wilds living alone all sorts of men may perchance be found poets
philosophers and even full-blown transcendentalists though you may go
far to find them

indians are seldom to be met with away from the sound excepting about
the few outlying hop ranches to which they resort in great numbers
during the picking season nor in your walks in the woods will you be
likely to see many of the wild animals however far you may go with the
exception of the douglas squirrel and the mountain goat the squirrel is
everywhere and the goat you can hardly fail to find if you climb any of
the high mountains the deer once very abundant may still be found on
the islands and along the shores of the sound but the large gray wolves
render their existence next to impossible at any considerable distance
back in the woods of the mainland as they can easily run them down
unless they are near enough to the coast to make their escape by
plunging into the water and swimming to the islands off shore the
elk and perhaps also the moose still exist in the most remote and
inaccessible solitudes of the forest but their numbers have been
greatly reduced of late and even the most experienced hunters have
difficulty in finding them of bears there are two species the black
and the large brown the former by far the more common of the two
on the shaggy bottom-lands where berries are plentiful and along the
rivers while salmon are going up to spawn the black bear may be found
fat and at home many are killed every year both for their flesh and
skins the large brown species likes higher and opener ground he is
a dangerous animal a near relative of the famous grizzly and wise
hunters are very fond of letting him alone

the towns of puget sound are of a very lively progressive and aspiring
kind fortunately with abundance of substance about them to warrant
their ambition and make them grow like young sapling sequoias they
are sending out their roots far and near for nourishment counting
confidently on longevity and grandeur of stature seattle and tacoma are
at present far in the lead of all others in the race for supremacy
and these two are keen active rivals to all appearances well matched
tacoma occupies near the head of the sound a site of great natural
beauty it is the terminus of the northern pacific railroad and calls
itself the "city of destiny" seattle is also charmingly located about
twenty miles down the sound from tacoma on elliott bay it is the
terminus of the seattle lake shore and eastern railroad now in
process of construction and calls itself the "queen city of the sound"
and the "metropolis of washington" what the populations of these towns
number i am not able to say with anything like exactness they are
probably about the same size and they each claim to have about twenty
thousand people but their figures are so rapidly changing and so often
mixed up with counts that refer to the future that exact measurements
of either of these places are about as hard to obtain as measurements of
the clouds of a growing storm their edges run back for miles into the
woods among the trees and stumps and brush which hide a good many of the
houses and the stakes which mark the lots so that without being as yet
very large towns they seem to fade away into the distance

but though young and loose-jointed they are fast taking on the forms
and manners of old cities putting on airs as some would say like
boys in haste to be men they are already towns "with all modern
improvements first-class in every particular" as is said of hotels
they have electric motors and lights paved broadways and boulevards
substantial business blocks schools churches factories and
foundries the lusty titanic clang of boiler making may be heard there
and plenty of the languid music of pianos mingling with the babel
noises of commerce carried on in a hundred tongues the main streets are
crowded with bright wide-awake lawyers ministers merchants agents
for everything under the sun ox drivers and loggers in stiff gummy
overalls back-slanting dudes well-tailored and shiny and fashions and
bonnets of every feather and color bloom gayly in the noisy throng and
advertise london and paris vigorous life and strife are to be seen
everywhere the spirit of progress is in the air still it is hard to
realize how much good work is being done here of a kind that makes
for civilization the enthusiastic exulting energy displayed in the
building of new towns railroads and mills in the opening of mines of
coal and iron and the development of natural resources in general to
many especially in the atlantic states washington is hardly known
at all it is regarded as being yet a far wild west a dim nebulous
expanse of woods by those who do not know that railroads and steamers
have brought the country out of the wilderness and abolished the old
distances it is now near to all the world and is in possession of a
share of the best of all that civilization has to offer while on some
of the lines of advancement it is at the front

notwithstanding the sharp rivalry between different sections and
towns the leading men mostly pull together for the general good and
glory building buying borrowing to push the country to its place
keeping arithmetic busy in counting population present and to come
ships towns factories tons of coal and iron feet of lumber miles
of railroad americans scandinavians irish scotch and germans being
joined together in the white heat of work like religious crowds in time
of revival who have forgotten sectarianism it is a fine thing to see
people in hot earnest about anything therefore however extravagant and
high the brag ascending from puget sound in most cases it is likely to
appear pardonable and more

seattle was named after an old indian chief who lived in this part of
the sound he was very proud of the honor and lived long enough to
lead his grandchildren about the streets the greater part of the lower
business portion of the town including a long stretch of wharves and
warehouses built on piles was destroyed by fire a few months ago [28]
with immense loss the people however are in no wise discouraged and
ere long the loss will be gain inasmuch as a better class of buildings
chiefly of brick are being erected in place of the inflammable wooden
ones which with comparatively few exceptions were built of pitchy
spruce

with their own scenery so glorious ever on show one would at first
thought suppose that these happy puget sound people would never go
sightseeing from home like less favored mortals but they do all the
same some go boating on the sound or on the lakes and rivers or with
their families make excursions at small cost on the steamers others
will take the train to the franklin and newcastle or carbon river coal
mines for the sake of the thirty- or forty-mile rides through the woods
and a look into the black depths of the underworld others again take
the steamers for victoria fraser river or vancouver the new ambitious
town at the terminus of the canadian railroad thus getting views of the
outer world in a near foreign country one of the regular summer resorts
of this region where people go for fishing hunting and the healing
of diseases is the green river hot springs in the cascade mountains
sixty-one miles east of tacoma on the line of the northern pacific
railroad green river is a small rocky stream with picturesque banks
and derives its name from the beautiful pale-green hue of its waters

among the most interesting of all the summer rest and pleasure places
is the famous "hop ranch" on the upper snoqualmie river thirty or forty
miles eastward from seattle here the dense forest opens allowing fine
free views of the adjacent mountains from a long stretch of ground
which is half meadow half prairie level and fertile and beautifully
diversified with outstanding groves of spruces and alders and rich
flowery fringes of spiraea and wild roses the river meandering deep and
tranquil through the midst of it on the portions most easily cleared
some three hundred acres of hop vines have been planted and are now in
full bearing yielding it is said at the rate of about a ton of
hops to the acre they are a beautiful crop these vines of the north
pillars of verdure in regular rows seven feet apart and eight or ten
feet in height the long vigorous shoots sweeping round in fine wild
freedom and the light leafy cones hanging in loose handsome clusters

perhaps enough of hops might be raised in washington for the wants of
all the world but it would be impossible to find pickers to handle the
crop most of the picking is done by indians and to this fine clean
profitable work they come in great numbers in their canoes old and
young of many different tribes bringing wives and children and
household goods in some cases from a distance of five or six hundred
miles even from far alaska then they too grow rich and spend their
money on red cloth and trinkets about a thousand indians are required
as pickers at the snoqualmie ranch alone and a lively and merry picture
they make in the field arrayed in bright showy calicoes lowering the
rustling vine pillars with incessant song-singing and fun still more
striking are their queer camps on the edges of the fields or over on the
river bank with the firelight shining on their wild jolly faces but
woe to the ranch should fire-water get there

but the chief attractions here are not found in the hops but in
trout-fishing and bear-hunting and in the two fine falls on the river
formerly the trip from seattle was a hard one over corduroy roads now
it is reached in a few hours by rail along the shores of lake washington
and lake squak through a fine sample section of the forest and past the
brow of the main snoqualmie fall from the hotel at the ranch village
the road to the fall leads down the right bank of the river through the
magnificent maple woods i have mentioned elsewhere and fine views
of the fall may be had on that side both from above and below it is
situated on the main river where it plunges over a sheer precipice
about two hundred and forty feet high in leaving the level meadows of
the ancient lake basin in a general way it resembles the well-known
nevada fall in yosemite having the same twisted appearance at the top
and the free plunge in numberless comet-shaped masses into a deep pool
seventy-five or eighty yards in diameter the pool is of considerable
depth as is shown by the radiating well-beaten foam and mist which is
of a beautiful rose color at times of exquisite fineness of tone and
by the heavy waves that lash the rocks in front of it

though to a californian the height of this fall would not seem great
the volume of water is heavy and all the surroundings are delightful
the maple forest of itself worth a long journey the beauty of the
river-reaches above and below and the views down the valley afar over
the mighty forests with all its lovely trimmings of ferns and flowers
make this one of the most interesting falls i have ever seen the upper
fall is about seventy-five feet high with bouncing rapids at head and
foot set in a romantic dell thatched with dripping mosses and ferns and
embowered in dense evergreens and blooming bushes the distance to it
from the upper end of the meadows being about eight miles the road
leads through majestic woods with ferns ten feet high beneath some of
the thickets and across a gravelly plain deforested by fire many years
ago orange lilies are plentiful and handsome shining mats of the
kinnikinic sprinkled with bright scarlet berries

from a place called "hunt's" at the end of the wagon road a trail
leads through lush dripping woods (never dry) to thuja and mertens
menzies and douglas spruces the ground is covered with the best
moss-work of the moist lands of the north made up mostly of the various
species of hypnum with some liverworts marchantia jungermannia etc
in broad sheets and bosses where never a dust particle floated and
where all the flowers fresh with mist and spray are wetter than water
lilies the pool at the foot of the fall is a place surpassingly lovely
to look at with the enthusiastic rush and song of the falls the
majestic trees overhead leaning over the brink like listeners eager
to catch every word of the white refreshing waters the delicate
maidenhairs and aspleniums with fronds outspread gathering the rainbow
sprays and the myriads of hooded mosses every cup fresh and shining




xx an ascent of mount rainier


ambitious climbers seeking adventures and opportunities to test their
strength and skill occasionally attempt to penetrate the wilderness on
the west side of the sound and push on to the summit of mount olympus
but the grandest excursion of all to be make hereabouts is to mount
rainier to climb to the top of its icy crown the mountain is very high
[29] fourteen thousand four hundred feet and laden with glaciers that
are terribly roughened and interrupted by crevasses and ice cliffs
only good climbers should attempt to gain the summit led by a guide of
proved nerve and endurance a good trail has been cut through the woods
to the base of the mountain on the north but the summit of the mountain
never has been reached from this side though many brave attempts have
been made upon it

last summer i gained the summit from the south side in a day and a half
from the timberline without encountering any desperate obstacles that
could not in some way be passed in good weather i was accompanied by
keith the artist professor ingraham and five ambitious young climbers
from seattle we were led by the veteran mountaineer and guide van
trump of yelm who many years before guided general stevens in his
memorable ascent and later mr bailey of oakland with a cumbersome
abundance of campstools and blankets we set out from seattle traveling
by rail as far as yelm prairie on the tacoma and oregon road here
we made our first camp and arranged with mr longmire a farmer in the
neighborhood for pack and saddle animals the noble king mountain
was in full view from here glorifying the bright sunny day with his
presence rising in godlike majesty over the woods with the magnificent
prairie as a foreground the distance to the mountain from yelm in a
straight line is perhaps fifty miles but by the mule and yellowjacket
trail we had to follow it is a hundred miles for notwithstanding a
portion of this trail runs in the air where the wasps work hardest it
is far from being an air line as commonly understood

by night of the third day we reached the soda springs on the right bank
of the nisqually which goes roaring by gray with mud gravel and
boulders from the caves of the glaciers of rainier now close at hand
the distance from the soda springs to the camp of the clouds is about
ten miles the first part of the way lies up the nisqually canyon
the bottom of which is flat in some places and the walls very high and
precipitous like those of the yosemite valley the upper part of the
canyon is still occupied by one of the nisqually glaciers from which
this branch of the river draws its source issuing from a cave in the
gray rock-strewn snout about a mile below the glacier we had to ford
the river which caused some anxiety for the current is very rapid and
carried forward large boulders as well as lighter material while its
savage roar is bewildering

at this point we left the canyon climbing out of it by a steep zigzag
up the old lateral moraine of the glacier which was deposited when the
present glacier flowed past at this height and is about eight hundred
feet high it is now covered with a superb growth of picea amabilis
[30] so also is the corresponding portion of the right lateral from
the top of the moraine still ascending we passed for a mile or two
through a forest of mixed growth mainly silver fir patton spruce
and mountain pine and then came to the charming park region at an
elevation of about five thousand feet above sea level here the vast
continuous woods at length begin to give way under the dominion of
climate though still at this height retaining their beauty and giving
no sign of stress of storm sweeping upward in belts of varying width
composed mainly of one species of fir sharp and spiry in form leaving
smooth spacious parks with here and there separate groups of trees
standing out in the midst of the openings like islands in a lake every
one of these parks great and small is a garden filled knee-deep with
fresh lovely flowers of every hue the most luxuriant and the most
extravagantly beautiful of all the alpine gardens i ever beheld in all
my mountain-top wanderings

we arrived at the cloud camp at noon but no clouds were in sight save
a few gauzy ornamental wreaths adrift in the sunshine out of the forest
at last there stood the mountain wholly unveiled awful in bulk and
majesty filling all the view like a separate new-born world yet
withal so fine and so beautiful it might well fire the dullest observer
to desperate enthusiasm long we gazed in silent admiration buried in
tall daisies and anemones by the side of a snowbank higher we could
not go with the animals and find food for them and wood for our own
campfires for just beyond this lies the region of ice with only here
and there an open spot on the ridges in the midst of the ice with dwarf
alpine plants such as saxifrages and drabas which reach far up between
the glaciers and low mats of the beautiful bryanthus while back of us
were the gardens and abundance of everything that heart could wish here
we lay all the afternoon considering the lilies and the lines of the
mountains with reference to a way to the summit

at noon next day we left camp and began our long climb we were in light
marching order save one who pluckily determined to carry his camera
to the summit at night after a long easy climb over wide and smooth
fields of ice we reached a narrow ridge at an elevation of about ten
thousand feet above the sea on the divide between the glaciers of the
nisqually and the cowlitz here we lay as best we could waiting for
another day without fire of course as we were now many miles beyond
the timberline and without much to cover us after eating a little
hardtack each of us leveled a spot to lie on among lava-blocks and
cinders the night was cold and the wind coming down upon us in stormy
surges drove gritty ashes and fragments of pumice about our ears while
chilling to the bone very short and shallow was our sleep that night
but day dawned at last early rising was easy and there was nothing
about breakfast to cause any delay about four o'clock we were off
and climbing began in earnest we followed up the ridge on which we had
spent the night now along its crest now on either side or on the
ice leaning against it until we came to where it becomes massive and
precipitous then we were compelled to crawl along a seam or narrow
shelf on its face which we traced to its termination in the base of
the great ice cap from this point all the climbing was over ice which
was here desperately steep but fortunately was at the same time carved
into innumerable spikes and pillars which afforded good footholds and
we crawled cautiously on warm with ambition and exercise

at length after gaining the upper extreme of our guiding ridge we
found a good place to rest and prepare ourselves to scale the dangerous
upper curves of the dome the surface almost everywhere was bare hard
snowless ice extremely slippery and though smooth in general it was
interrupted by a network of yawning crevasses outspread like lines of
defense against any attempt to win the summit here every one of the
party took off his shoes and drove stout steel caulks about half an
inch long into them having brought tools along for the purpose and
not having made use of them until now so that the points might not get
dulled on the rocks ere the smooth dangerous ice was reached besides
being well shod each carried an alpenstock and for special difficulties
we had a hundred feet of rope and an axe

thus prepared we stepped forth afresh slowly groping our way through
tangled lines of crevasses crossing on snow bridges here and there
after cautiously testing them jumping at narrow places or crawling
around the ends of the largest bracing well at every point with our
alpenstocks and setting our spiked shoes squarely down on the dangerous
slopes it was nerve-trying work most of it but we made good speed
nevertheless and by noon all stood together on the utmost summit save
one who his strength failing for a time came up later

we remained on the summit nearly two hours looking about us at the vast
maplike views comprehending hundreds of miles of the cascade range
with their black interminable forests and white volcanic cones in
glorious array reaching far into oregon the sound region also and
the great plains of eastern washington hazy and vague in the distance
clouds began to gather soon of all the land only the summits of the
mountains st helen's adams and hood were left in sight forming
islands in the sky we found two well-formed and well-preserved craters
on the summit lying close together like two plates on a table with
their rims touching the highest point of the mountain is located
between the craters where their edges come in contact sulphurous fumes
and steam issue from several vents giving out a sickening smell that
can be detected at a considerable distance the unwasted condition of
these craters and indeed to a great extent of the entire mountain
would tend to show that rainier is still a comparatively young mountain
with the exception of the projecting lips of the craters and the top of
a subordinate summit a short distance to the northward the mountains is
solidly capped with ice all around and it is this ice cap which forms
the grand central fountain whence all the twenty glaciers of rainier
flow radiating in every direction

the descent was accomplished without disaster though several of the
party had narrow escapes one slipped and fell and as he shot past me
seemed to be going to certain death so steep was the ice slope no one
could move to help him but fortunately keeping his presence of mind
he threw himself on his face and digging his alpenstock into the ice
gradually retarded his motion until he came to rest another broke
through a slim bridge over a crevasse but his momentum at the time
carried him against the lower edge and only his alpenstock was lost in
the abyss thus crippled by the loss of his staff we had to lower
him the rest of the way down the dome by means of the rope we carried
falling rocks from the upper precipitous part of the ridge were also a
source of danger as they came whizzing past in successive volleys but
none told on us and when we at length gained the gentle slopes of the
lower ice fields we ran and slid at our ease making fast glad time
all care and danger past and arrived at our beloved cloud camp before
sundown

we were rather weak from want of nourishment and some suffered from
sunburn notwithstanding the partial protection of glasses and veils
otherwise all were unscathed and well the view we enjoyed from the
summit could hardly be surpassed in sublimity and grandeur but one
feels far from home so high in the sky so much so that one is
inclined to guess that apart from the acquisition of knowledge and the
exhilaration of climbing more pleasure is to be found at the foot of
the mountains than on their tops doubly happy however is the man to
whom lofty mountain tops are within reach for the lights that shine
there illumine all that lies below




xxi the physical and climatic characteristics of oregon


oregon is a large rich compact section of the west side of the
continent containing nearly a hundred thousand square miles of deep
wet evergreen woods fertile valleys icy mountains and high rolling
wind-swept plains watered by the majestic columbia river and its
countless branches it is bounded on the north by washington on the
east by idaho on the south by california and nevada and on the west by
the pacific ocean it is a grand hearty wholesome foodful wilderness
and like washington once a part of the oregon territory abounds
in bold far-reaching contrasts as to scenery climate soil and
productions side by side there is drouth on a grand scale and
overflowing moisture flinty sharply cut lava beds gloomy and
forbidding and smooth flowery lawns cool bogs exquisitely plushy and
soft overshadowed by jagged crags barren as icebergs forests seemingly
boundless and plains with no tree in sight presenting a wide range of
conditions but as a whole favorable to industry natural wealth of
an available kind abounds nearly everywhere inviting the farmer the
stock-raiser the lumberman the fisherman the manufacturer and the
miner as well as the free walker in search of knowledge and wildness
the scenery is mostly of a comfortable assuring kind grand and
inspiring without too much of that dreadful overpowering sublimity and
exuberance which tend to discourage effort and cast people into inaction
and superstition

ever since oregon was first heard of in the romantic adventurous
hunting trapping wild west days it seems to have been regarded as the
most attractive and promising of all the pacific countries for farmers
while yet the whole region as well as the way to it was wild ere
a single road or bridge was built undaunted by the trackless
thousand-mile distances and scalping cattle-stealing indians long
trains of covered wagons began to crawl wearily westward crossing how
many plains rivers ridges and mountains fighting the painted savages
and weariness and famine setting out from the frontier of the old west
in the spring as soon as the grass would support their cattle they
pushed on up the platte making haste slowly however that they might
not be caught in the storms of winter ere they reached the promised
land they crossed the rocky mountains to fort hall thence followed
down the snake river for three or four hundred miles their cattle
limping and failing on the rough lava plains swimming the streams too
deep to be forded making boats out of wagon-boxes for the women and
children and goods or where trees could be had lashing together logs
for rafts thence crossing the blue mountains and the plains of the
columbia they followed the river to the dalles here winter would
be upon them and before a wagon road was built across the cascade
mountains the toil-worn emigrants would be compelled to leave their
cattle and wagons until the following summer and in the mean time
with the assistance of the hudson's bay company make their way to the
willamette valley on the river with rafts and boats

how strange and remote these trying times have already become they
are now dim as if a thousand years had passed over them steamships
and locomotives with magical influence have well-nigh abolished the old
distances and dangers and brought forward the new west into near and
familiar companionship with the rest of the world

purely wild for unnumbered centuries a paradise of oily salmon-fed
indians oregon is now roughly settled in part and surveyed its rivers
and mountain ranges lakes valleys and plains have been traced and
mapped in a general way civilization is beginning to take root towns
are springing up and flourishing vigorously like a crop adapted to the
soil and the whole kindly wilderness lies invitingly near with all its
wealth open and ripe for use

in sailing along the oregon coast one sees but few more signs of human
occupation than did juan de fuca three centuries ago the shore bluffs
rise abruptly from the waves forming a wall apparently unbroken though
many short rivers from the coast range of mountains and two from the
interior have made narrow openings on their way to the sea at the
mouths of these rivers good harbors have been discovered for coasting
vessels which are of great importance to the lumbermen dairymen and
farmers of the coast region but little or nothing of these appear in
general views only a simple gray wall nearly straight green along the
top and the forest stretching back into the mountains as far as the eye
can reach

going ashore we find few long reaches of sand where one may saunter
or meadows save the brown and purple meadows of the sea overgrown
with slippery kelp swashed and swirled in the restless breakers the
abruptness of the shore allows the massive waves that have come from far
over the broad pacific to get close to the bluffs ere they break and
the thundering shock shakes the rocks to their foundations no calm
comes to these shores even in the finest weather when the ships off
shore are becalmed and their sails hang loose against the mast there
is always a wreath of foam at the base of these bluffs the breakers are
ever in bloom and crystal brine is ever in the air

a scramble along the oregon sea bluffs proves as richly exciting to
lovers of wild beauty as heart could wish here are three hundred miles
of pictures of rock and water in black and white or gray and white
with more or less of green and yellow purple and blue the rocks
glistening in sunshine and foam are never wholly dry many of them
marvels of wave-sculpture and most imposing in bulk and bearing
standing boldly forward monuments of a thousand storms types of
permanence holding the homes and places of refuge of multitudes of
seafaring animals in their keeping yet ever wasting away how grand
the songs of the waves about them every wave a fine hearty storm
in itself taking its rise on the breezy plains of the sea perhaps
thousands of miles away traveling with majestic slow-heaving
deliberation reaching the end of its journey striking its blow
bursting into a mass of white and pink bloom then falling spent and
withered to give place to the next in the endless procession thus
keeping up the glorious show and glorious song through all times and
seasons forever

terribly impressive as is this cliff and wave scenery when the skies are
bright and kindly sunshine makes rainbows in the spray it is doubly
so in dark stormy nights when crouching in some hollow on the top of
some jutting headland we may gaze and listen undisturbed in the heart
of it perhaps now and then we may dimly see the tops of the highest
breakers looking ghostly in the gloom but when the water happens to be
phosphorescent as it oftentimes is then both the sea and the rocks are
visible and the wild exulting up-dashing spray burns every particle
of it and is combined into one glowing mass of white fire while back
in the woods and along the bluffs and crags of the shore the storm wind
roars and the rain-floods gathering strength and coming from far and
near rush wildly down every gulch to the sea as if eager to join the
waves in their grand savage harmony deep calling unto deep in the
heart of the great dark night making a sight and a song unspeakably
sublime and glorious

in the pleasant weather of summer after the rainy season is past and
only occasional refreshing showers fall washing the sky and bringing
out the fragrance of the flowers and the evergreens then one may enjoy
a fine free walk all the way across the state from the sea to the
eastern boundary on the snake river many a beautiful stream we should
cross in such a walk singing through forest and meadow and deep rocky
gorge and many a broad prairie and plain mountain and valley wild
garden and desert presenting landscape beauty on a grand scale and in
a thousand forms and new lessons without number delightful to learn
oregon has three mountain ranges which run nearly parallel with the
coast the most influential of which in every way is the cascade
range it is about six thousand to seven thousand feet in average
height and divides the state into two main sections called eastern and
western oregon corresponding with the main divisions of washington
while these are again divided but less perfectly by the blue mountains
and the coast range the eastern section is about two hundred and thirty
miles wide and is made up in great part of the treeless plains of the
columbia which are green and flowery in spring but gray dusty hot
and forbidding in summer considerable areas however on these plains
as well as some of the valleys countersunk below the general surface
along the banks of the streams have proved fertile and produce large
crops of wheat barley hay and other products

in general views the western section seems to be covered with one vast
evenly planted forest with the exception of the few snow-clad peaks of
the cascade range these peaks being the only points in the landscape
that rise above the timberline nevertheless embosomed in this forest
and lying in the great trough between the cascades and coast mountains
there are some of the best bread-bearing valleys to be found in the
world the largest of these are the willamette umpqua and rogue river
valleys inasmuch as a considerable portion of these main valleys was
treeless or nearly so as well as surpassingly fertile they were the
first to attract settlers and the willamette being at once the largest
and nearest to tide water was settled first of all and now contains
the greater portion of the population and wealth of the state

the climate of this section like the corresponding portion of
washington is rather damp and sloppy throughout the winter months
but the summers are bright ripening the wheat and allowing it to be
garnered in good condition taken as a whole the weather is bland and
kindly and like the forest trees the crops and cattle grow plump and
sound in it so also do the people children ripen well and grow up with
limbs of good size and fiber and unless overworked in the woods live
to a good old age hale and hearty

but like every other happy valley in the world the sunshine of this
one is not without its shadows malarial fevers are not unknown in some
places and untimely frosts and rains may at long intervals in
some measure disappoint the hopes of the husbandman many a tale
good-natured or otherwise is told concerning the overflowing abundance
of the oregon rains once an english traveler as the story goes went
to a store to make some purchases and on leaving found that rain was
falling therefore not liking to get wet he stepped back to wait
till the shower was over seeing no signs of clearing he soon became
impatient and inquired of the storekeeper how long he thought the shower
would be likely to last going to the door and looking wisely into the
gray sky and noting the direction of the wind the latter replied that
he thought the shower would probably last about six months an opinion
that of course disgusted the fault-finding briton with the "blawsted
country" though in fact it is but little if at all wetter or cloudier
than his own

no climate seems the best for everybody many there be who waste their
lives in a vain search for weather with which no fault may be found
keeping themselves and their families in constant motion like floating
seaweeds that never strike root yielding compliance to every current
of news concerning countries yet untried believing that everywhere
anywhere the sky is fairer and the grass grows greener than where they
happen to be before the oregon and california railroad was built the
overland journey between these states across the siskiyou mountains
in the old-fashioned emigrant wagon was a long and tedious one
nevertheless every season dissatisfied climate-seekers too wet and too
dry might be seen plodding along through the dust in the old "49style"
making their way one half of them from california to oregon the other
half from oregon to california the beautiful sisson meadows at the base
of mount shasta were a favorite halfway resting place where the weary
cattle were turned out for a few days to gather strength for better
climates and it was curious to hear those perpetual pioneers comparing
notes and seeking information around the campfires

"where are you from?" some oregonian would ask

"the joaquin"

"it's dry there ain't it?"

"well i should say so no rain at all in summer and none to speak of in
winter and i'm dried out i just told my wife i was on the move again
and i'm going to keep moving till i come to a country where it rains
once in a while like it does in every reg'lar white man's country and
that i guess will be oregon if the news be true"

"yes neighbor you's heading in the right direction for rain" the
oregonian would say "keep right on to yamhill and you'll soon be damp
enough it rains there more than twelve months in the year at least no
saying but it will i've just come from there plumb drownded out and
i told my wife to jump into the wagon and we should start out and see if
we couldn't find a dry day somewhere last fall the hay was out and
the wood was out and the cabin leaked and i made up my mind to try
california the first chance"

"well if you be a horned toad or coyote" the seeker of moisture would
reply "then maybe you can stand it just keep right on by the alabama
settlement to tulare and you can have my place on big dry creek and
welcome you'll be drowned there mighty seldom the wagon spokes and
tires will rattle and tell you when you come to it"

"all right partner we'll swap square you can have mine in yamhill
and the rain thrown in last august a painter sharp came along one day
wanting to know the way to willamette falls and i told him young ma
 going to oregon city after them the whole dog-gone noah's flood of a
country will be a fall and melt and float away some day'" and more to
the same effect

but no one need leave oregon in search of fair weather the wheat and
cattle region of eastern oregon and washington on the upper columbia
plains is dry enough and dusty enough more than half the year the truth
is most of these wanderers enjoy the freedom of gypsy life and seek not
homes but camps having crossed the plains and reached the ocean they
can find no farther west within reach of wagons and are therefore
compelled now to go north and south between mexico and alaska always
glad to find an excuse for moving stopping a few months or weeks here
and there the time being measured by the size of the camp-meadow
conditions of the grass game and other indications even their
so-called settlements of a year or two when they take up land and build
cabins are only another kind of camp in no common sense homes never a
tree is planted nor do they plant themselves but like good soldiers in
time of war are ever ready to march their journey of life is indeed a
journey with very matter-of-fact thorns in the way though not wholly
wanting in compensation

one of the most influential of the motives that brought the early
settlers to these shores apart from that natural instinct to scatter
and multiply which urges even sober salmon to climb the rocky mountains
was their desire to find a country at once fertile and winterless where
their flocks and herds could find pasture all the year thus doing away
with the long and tiresome period of haying and feeding necessary in the
eastern and old western states and territories cheap land and good land
there was in abundance in kansas nebraska minnesota and iowa but
there the labor of providing for animals of the farm was very great and
much of that labor was crowded together into a few summer months
while to keep cool in summers and warm in the icy winters was well-nigh
impossible to poor farmers

along the coast and throughout the greater part of western oregon in
general snow seldom falls on the lowlands to a greater depth than a
few inches and never lies long grass is green all winter the average
temperature for the year in the willamette valley is about 52 degrees
the highest and lowest being about 100 degrees and 20 degrees though
occasionally a much lower temperature is reached

the average rainfall is about fifty or fifty-five inches in the
willamette valley and along the coast seventy-five inches or even more
at some points figures that bring many a dreary night and day to mind
however fine the effect on the great evergreen woods and the fields of
the farmers the rainy season begins in september or october and lasts
until april or may then the whole country is solemnly soaked and
poulticed with the gray streaming clouds and fogs night and day with
marvelous constancy towards the beginning and end of the season a good
many bright days occur to break the pouring gloom but whole months of
rain continuous or nearly so are not at all rare astronomers beneath
these oregon skies would have a dull time of it of all the year only
about one fourth of the days are clear while three fourths have more or
less of fogs clouds or rain

the fogs occur mostly in the fall and spring they are grand
far-reaching affairs of two kinds the black and the white some of the
latter being very beautiful and the infinite delicacy and tenderness
of their touch as they linger to caress the tall evergreens is most
exquisite on farms and highways and in the streets of towns where
work has to be done there is nothing picturesque or attractive in any
obvious way about the gray serious-faced rainstorms mud abounds the
rain seems dismal and heedless and gets in everybody's way every
face is turned from it and it has but few friends who recognize its
boundless beneficence but back in the untrodden woods where no axe has
been lifted where a deep rich carpet of brown and golden mosses covers
all the ground like a garment pressing warmly about the feet of the
trees and rising in thick folds softly and kindly over every fallen
trunk leaving no spot naked or uncared-for there the rain is welcomed
and every drop that falls finds a place and use as sweet and pure as
itself an excursion into the woods when the rain harvest is at its
height is a noble pleasure and may be safely enjoyed at small expense
though very few care to seek it shelter is easily found beneath the
great trees in some hollow out of the wind and one need carry but
little provision none at all of a kind that a wetting would spoil the
colors of the woods are then at their best and the mighty hosts of the
forest every needle tingling in the blast wave and sing in glorious
harmony

   "'t were worth ten years of peaceful life
     one glance at this array"

the snow that falls in the lowland woods is usually soft and makes a
fine show coming through the trees in large feathery tufts loading
the branches of the firs and spruces and cedars and weighing them down
against the trunks until they look slender and sharp as arrows while
a strange muffled silence prevails giving a peculiar solemnity to
everything but these lowland snowstorms and their effects quickly
vanish every crystal melts in a day or two the bent branches rise
again and the rain resumes its sway

while these gracious rains are searching the roots of the lowlands
corresponding snows are busy along the heights of the cascade mountains
month after month day and night the heavens shed their icy bloom in
stormy measureless abundance filling the grand upper fountains of
the rivers to last through the summer awful then is the silence that
presses down over the mountain forests all the smaller streams vanish
from sight hushed and obliterated young groves of spruce and pine are
bowed down as by a gentle hand and put to rest not again to see the
light or move leaf or limb until the grand awakening of the springtime
while the larger animals and most of the birds seek food and shelter in
the foothills on the borders of the valleys and plains

the lofty volcanic peaks are yet more heavily snow-laden to their upper
zones no summer comes they are white always from the steep slopes of
the summit the new-fallen snow while yet dry and loose descends in
magnificent avalanches to feed the glaciers making meanwhile the most
glorious manifestations of power happy is the man who may get near
them to see and hear in some sheltered camp nest on the edge of the
timberline one may lie snug and warm but after the long shuffle on
snowshoes we may have to wait more than a month ere the heavens open
and the grand show is unveiled in the mean time bread may be scarce
unless with careful forecast a sufficient supply has been provided
and securely placed during the summer nevertheless to be thus deeply
snowbound high in the sky is not without generous compensation for all
the cost and when we at length go down the long white slopes to the
levels of civilization the pains vanish like snow in sunshine while
the noble and exalting pleasures we have gained remain with us to enrich
our lives forever

the fate of the high-flying mountain snow-flowers is a fascinating
study though little may we see of their works and ways while their
storms go on the glinting swirling swarms fairly thicken the blast
and all the air as well as the rocks and trees is as one smothering
mass of bloom through the midst of which at close intervals come the
low intense thunder-tones of the avalanches as they speed on their way
to fill the vast fountain hollows here they seem at last to have found
rest but this rest is only apparent gradually the loose crystals by
the pressure of their own weight are welded together into clear ice
and as glaciers march steadily silently on with invisible motion in
broad deep currents grinding their way with irresistible energy to the
warmer lowlands where they vanish in glad rejoicing streams

in the sober weather of oregon lightning makes but little show those
magnificent thunderstorms that so frequently adorn and glorify the sky
of the mississippi valley are wanting here dull thunder and lightning
may occasionally be seen and heard but the imposing grandeur of great
storms marching over the landscape with streaming banners and a network
of fire is almost wholly unknown

crossing the cascade range we pass from a green to a gray country from
a wilderness of trees to a wilderness of open plains level or rolling
or rising here and there into hills and short mountain spurs though
well supplied with rivers in most of its main sections it is generally
dry the annual rainfall is only from about five to fifteen inches and
the thin winter garment of snow seldom lasts more than a month or two
though the temperature in many places falls from five to twenty-five
degrees below zero for a short time that the snow is light over eastern
oregon and the average temperature not intolerably severe is shown
by the fact that large droves of sheep cattle and horses live there
through the winter without other food or shelter than they find for
themselves on the open plains or down in the sunken valleys and gorges
along the streams

when we read of the mountain ranges of oregon and washington with
detailed descriptions of their old volcanoes towering snow-laden and
glacier-laden above the clouds one may be led to imagine that the
country is far icier and whiter and more mountainous than it is only
in winter are the coast and cascade mountains covered with snow then
as seen from the main interior valleys they appear as comparatively
low bossy walls stretching along the horizon and making a magnificent
display of their white wealth the coast range in oregon does not
perhaps average more than three thousand feet in height its snow does
not last long most of its soil is fertile all the way to the summits
and the greater part of the range may at some time be brought under
cultivation the immense deposits on the great central uplift of the
cascade range are mostly melted off before the middle of summer by the
comparatively warm winds and rains from the coast leaving only a few
white spots on the highest ridges where the depth from drifting
has been greatest or where the rate of waste has been diminished by
specially favorable conditions as to exposure only the great volcanic
cones are truly snow-clad all the year and these are not numerous and
make but a small portion of the general landscape

as we approach oregon from the coast in summer no hint of snowy
mountains can be seen and it is only after we have sailed into the
country by the columbia or climbed some one of the commanding
summits that the great white peaks send us greeting and make telling
advertisements of themselves and of the country over which they rule
so also in coming to oregon from the east the country by no means
impresses one as being surpassingly mountainous the abode of peaks and
glaciers descending the spurs of the rocky mountains into the basin of
the columbia we see hot hundred-mile plains roughened here the there
by hills and ridges that look hazy and blue in the distance until we
have pushed well to the westward then one white point after another
comes into sight to refresh the eye and the imagination but they are
yet a long way off and have much to say only to those who know them or
others of their kind how grand they are though insignificant-looking
on the edge of the vast landscape what noble woods they nourish and
emerald meadows and gardens what springs and streams and waterfalls
sing about them and to what a multitude of happy creatures they give
homes and food

the principal mountains of the range are mounts pitt scott and
thielson diamond peak the three sisters mounts jefferson hood st
helen's adams rainier aix and baker of these the seven first
named belong to oregon the others to washington they rise singly at
irregular distances from one another along the main axis of the range
or near it with an elevation of from about eight thousand to fourteen
thousand four hundred feet above the level of the sea from few points
in the valleys may more than three or four of them be seen and of the
more distant ones of these only the tops appear therefore speaking
generally each of the lowland landscapes of the state contains only one
grand snowy mountain

the heights back of portland command one of the best general views of
the forests and also of the most famous of the great mountains both of
oregon and washington mount hood is in full view with the summits of
mounts jefferson st helen's adams and rainier in the distance the
city of portland is at our feet covering a large area along both banks
of the willamette and with its fine streets schools churches mills
shipping parks and gardens makes a telling picture of busy aspiring
civilization in the midst of the green wilderness in which it is
planted the river is displayed to fine advantage in the foreground of
our main view sweeping in beautiful curves around rich leafy islands
its banks fringed with willows

a few miles beyond the willamette flows the renowned columbia and the
confluence of these two great rivers is at a point only about ten miles
below the city beyond the columbia extends the immense breadth of the
forest one dim black monotonous field with only the sky which one is
glad to see is not forested and the tops of the majestic old volcanoes
to give diversity to the view that sharp white broad-based pyramid on
the south side of the columbia a few degrees to the south of east
from where you stand is the famous mount hood the distance to it in a
straight line is about fifty miles its upper slopes form the only bare
ground bare as to forests in the landscape in that direction it is
the pride of oregonians and when it is visible is always pointed out to
strangers as the glory of the country the mountain of mountains it
is one of the grand series of extinct volcanoes extending from lassen's
butte [31] to mount baker a distance of about six hundred miles which
once flamed like gigantic watch-fires along the coast some of them have
been active in recent times but no considerable addition to the bulk
of mount hood has been made for several centuries as is shown by the
amount of glacial denudation it has suffered its summit has been ground
to a point which gives it a rather thin pinched appearance it has a
wide-flowing base however and is fairly well proportioned though it
is eleven thousand feet high it is too far off to make much show under
ordinary conditions in so extensive a landscape through a great part of
the summer it is invisible on account of smoke poured into the sky from
burning woods logging camps mills etc and in winter for weeks at
a time or even months it is in the clouds only in spring and early
summer and in what there may chance to be of bright weather in winter is
it or any of its companions at all clear or telling from the cascades
on the columbia it may be seen at a distance of twenty miles or
thereabouts or from other points up and down the river and with the
magnificent foreground it is very impressive it gives the supreme
touch of grandeur to all the main columbia views rising at every turn
solitary majestic awe-inspiring the ruling spirit of the landscape
but like mountains everywhere it varies greatly in impressiveness
and apparent height at different times and seasons not alone from
differences as to the dimness or transparency of the air clear or
arrayed in clouds it changes both in size and general expression now
it looms up to an immense height and seems to draw near in tremendous
grandeur and beauty holding the eyes of every beholder in devout and
awful interest next year or next day or even in the same day you
return to the same point of view perhaps to find that the glory has
departed as if the mountain had died and the poor dull shrunken mass
of rocks and ice had lost all power to charm

never shall i forget my first glorious view of mount hood one calm
evening in july though i had seen it many times before this i was
then sauntering with a friend across the new willamette bridge between
portland and east portland for the sake of the river views which are
here very fine in the tranquil summer weather the scene on the water
was a lively one boats of every description were gliding glinting
drifting about at work or play and we leaned over the rail from time
to time contemplating the gay throng several lines of ferry boats were
making regular trips at intervals of a few minutes and river steamers
were coming and going from the wharves laden with all sorts of
merchandise raising long diverging swells that make all the light
pleasure craft bow and nod in hearty salutation as they passed the
crowd was being constantly increased by new arrivals from both shores
sailboats rowboats racing shells rafts were loaded with gayly
dressed people and here and there some adventurous man or boy might be
seen as a merry sailor on a single plank or spar apparently as deep in
enjoyment as were any on the water it seemed as if all the town
were coming to the river renouncing the cares and toils of the day
determined to take the evening breeze into their pulses and be cool and
tranquil ere going to bed

absorbed in the happy scene given up to dreamy random observation
of what lay immediately before me i was not conscious of anything
occurring on the outer rim of the landscape forest mountain and sky
were forgotten when my companion suddenly directed my attention to the
eastward shouting "oh look look" in so loud and excited a tone
of voice that passers-by saunterers like ourselves were startled and
looked over the bridge as if expecting to see some boat upset looking
across the forest over which the mellow light of the sunset was
streaming i soon discovered the source of my friend's excitement there
stood mount hood in all the glory of the alpenglow looming immensely
high beaming with intelligence and so impressive that one was overawed
as if suddenly brought before some superior being newly arrived from the
sky

the atmosphere was somewhat hazy but the mountain seemed neither
near nor far its glaciers flashed in the divine light the rugged
storm-worn ridges between them and the snowfields of the summit these
perhaps might have been traced as far as they were in sight and the
blending zones of color about the base but so profound was the general
impression partial analysis did not come into play the whole mountain
appeared as one glorious manifestation of divine power enthusiastic and
benevolent glowing like a countenance with ineffable repose and beauty
before which we could only gaze in devout and lowly admiration

the far-famed oregon forests cover all the western section of the state
the mountains as well as the lowlands with the exception of a few
gravelly spots and open spaces in the central portions of the great
cultivated valleys beginning on the coast where their outer ranks are
drenched and buffeted by wind-driven scud from the sea they press on in
close majestic ranks over the coast mountains across the broad central
valleys and over the cascade range broken and halted only by the few
great peaks that rise like islands above the sea of evergreens

in descending the eastern slopes of the cascades the rich abounding
triumphant exuberance of the trees is quickly subdued they become
smaller grow wide apart leaving dry spaces without moss covering
or underbrush and before the foot of the range is reached fail
altogether stayed by the drouth of the interior almost as suddenly as
on the western margin they are stayed by the sea here and there at wide
intervals on the eastern plains patches of a small pine (pinus contorta)
are found and a scattering growth of juniper used by the settlers
mostly for fence posts and firewood along the stream bottoms there is
usually more or less of cottonwood and willow which though yielding
inferior timber is yet highly prized in this bare region on the blue
mountains there is pine spruce fir and larch in abundance for every
use but beyond this range there is nothing that may be called a forest
in the columbia river basin until we reach the spurs of the rocky
mountains and these rocky mountain forests are made up of trees which
compared with the giants of the pacific slope are mere saplings




xxii the forests of oregon and their inhabitants


like the forests of washington already described those of oregon are
in great part made up of the douglas spruce [32] or oregon pine (abies
douglasii) a large number of mills are at work upon this species
especially along the columbia but these as yet have made but little
impression upon its dense masses the mills here being small as compared
with those of the puget sound region the white cedar or port orford
cedar (cupressus lawsoniana or chamaecyparis lawsoniana) is one of
the most beautiful of the evergreens and produces excellent lumber
considerable quantities of which are shipped to the san francisco
market it is found mostly about coos bay along the coquille river and
on the northern slopes of the siskiyou mountains and extends down the
coast into california the silver firs the spruces and the colossal
arbor-vitae or white cedar [33](thuja gigantea) described in
the chapter on washington are also found here in great beauty and
perfection the largest of these (picea grandis loud abies grandis
lindl) being confined mostly to the coast region where it attains a
height of three hundred feet and a diameter of ten or twelve feet five
or six species of pines are found in the state the most important of
which both as to lumber and as to the part they play in the general
wealth and beauty of the forests are the yellow and sugar pines (pinus
ponderosa and p lambertiana) the yellow pine is most abundant on
the eastern slopes of the cascades forming there the main bulk of the
forest in many places it is also common along the borders of the open
spaces in willamette valley in the southern portion of the state the
sugar pine which is the king of all the pines and the glory of the
sierra forests occurs in considerable abundance in the basins of the
umpqua and rogue rivers and it was in the umpqua hills that this noble
tree was first discovered by the enthusiastic botanical explorer david
douglas in the year 1826

this is the douglas for whom the noble douglas spruce is named and many
a fair blooming plant also which will serve to keep his memory fresh
and sweet as long as beautiful trees and flowers are loved the indians
of the lower columbia river watched him with lively curiosity as he
wandered about in the woods day after day gazing intently on the ground
or at the great trees collecting specimens of everything he saw but
unlike all the eager fur-gathering strangers they had hitherto seen
caring nothing about trade and when at length they came to know him
better and saw that from year to year the growing things of the woods
and prairies meadows and plains were his only object of pursuit they
called him the "man of grass" a title of which he was proud

he was a scotchman and first came to this coast in the spring of 1825
under the auspices of the london horticultural society landing at the
mouth of the columbia after a long dismal voyage of eight months
and fourteen days during this first season he chose fort vancouver
belonging to the hudson's bay company as his headquarters and from
there made excursions into the glorious wilderness in every direction
discovering many new species among the trees as well as among the rich
underbrush and smaller herbaceous vegetation it was while making a
trip to mount hood this year that he discovered the two largest and most
beautiful firs in the world (picea amabilis and p nobilis now called
abies) and from the seeds which he then collected and sent home tall
trees are now growing in scotland

in one of his trips that summer in the lower willamette valley he
saw in an indian's tobacco pouch some of the seeds and scales of a new
species of pine which he learned were gathered from a large tree that
grew far to the southward most of the following season was spent on
the upper waters of the columbia and it was not until september that
he returned to fort vancouver about the time of the setting-in of the
winter rains nevertheless bearing in mind the great pine he had heard
of and the seeds of which he had seen he made haste to set out on an
excursion to the headwaters of the willamette in search of it and how
he fared on this excursion and what dangers and hardships he endured is
best told in his own journal part of which i quote as follows 

   october 26th 1826  weather dull  cold and cloudy  when my
   friends in england are made acquainted with my travels i fear
   they will think that i have told them nothing but my miseries
   i quitted my camp early in the morning to survey the neighboring
   country leaving my guide to take charge of the horses until my
   return in the evening  about an hour's walk from the camp i met
   an indian who on perceiving me instantly strung his bow placed
   on his left arm a sleeve of raccoon skin and stood on the
   defensive  being quite sure that conduct was prompted by fear and
   not by hostile intentions the poor fellow having probably never
   seen such a being as myself before i laid my gun at my feet on the
   ground and waved my hand for him to come to me which he did slowly
   and with great caution  i then made him place his bow and quiver
   of arrows beside my gun and striking a light gave him a smoke out
   of my own pipe and a present of a few beads  with my pencil i made
   a rough sketch of the cone and pine tree which i wanted to obtain
   and drew his attention to it when he instantly pointed with his
   hand to the hills fifteen or twenty miles distant towards the
   south and when i expressed my intention of going thither
   cheerfully set about accompanying me  at midday i reached my long-
   wished-for pines and lost no time in examining them and endeavoring
   to collect specimens and seeds  new and strange things seldom fail
   to make strong impressions and are therefore frequently overrated
   so that lest i should never see my friends in england to inform
   them verbally of this most beautiful and immensely grand tree i
   shall here state the dimensions of the largest i could find among
   several that had been blown down by the wind  at three feet from
   the ground its circumference is fifty-seven feet nine inches at
   one hundred and thirty-four feet seventeen feet five inches the
   extreme length two hundred and forty-five feet  as it was
   impossible either to climb the tree or hew it down i endeavored to
   knock off the cones by firing at them with ball when the report of
   my gun brought eight indians all of them painted with red earth
   armed with bows arrows bone-tipped spears and flint knives
   they appeared anything but friendly  i explained to them what i
   wanted and they seemed satisfied and sat down to smoke but
   presently i saw one of them string his bow and another sharpen his
   flint knife with a pair of wooden pincers and suspend it on the
   wrist of his right hand  further testimony of their intentions was
   unnecessary  to save myself by flight was impossible so without
   hesitation i stepped back about five paces cocked my gun drew one
   of the pistols out of my belt and holding it in my left hand the
   gun in my right showed myself determined to fight for my life  as
   much as possible i endeavored to preserve my coolness and thus we
   stood looking at one another without making any movement or
   uttering a word for perhaps ten minutes when one at last who
   seemed to be the leader gave a sign that they wished for some
   tobacco this i signified they should have if they fetched a
   quantity of cones  they went off immediately in search of them
   and no sooner were they all out of sight than i picked up my three
   cones and some twigs of the trees and made the quickest possible
   retreat hurrying back to my camp which i reached before dusk
   the indian who last undertook to be my guide to the trees i sent
   off before gaining my encampment lest he should betray me how
   irksome is the darkness of night to one under such circumstances
   i cannot speak a word to my guide nor have i a book to divert my
   thoughts which are continually occupied with the dread lest the
   hostile indians should trace me hither and make an attack  i now
   write lying on the grass with my gun cocked beside me and penning
   these lines by the light of my columbian candle namely an ignited
   piece of rosin-wood

douglas named this magnificent species pinus lambertiana in honor of
his friend dr lambert of london this is the noblest pine thus far
discovered in the forests of the world surpassing all others not only
in size but in beauty and majesty oregon may well be proud that its
discovery was made within her borders and that though it is far more
abundant in california she has the largest known specimens in the
sierra the finest sugar pine forests lie at an elevation of about five
thousand feet in oregon they occupy much lower ground some of the
trees being found but little above tide-water

no lover of trees will ever forget his first meeting with the sugar
pine in most coniferous trees there is a sameness of form and
expression which at length becomes wearisome to most people who travel
far in the woods but the sugar pines are as free from conventional
forms as any of the oaks no two are so much alike as to hide their
individuality from any observer every tree is appreciated as a study
in itself and proclaims in no uncertain terms the surpassing grandeur of
the species the branches mostly near the summit are sometimes
nearly forty feet long feathered richly all around with short leafy
branchlets and tasseled with cones a foot and a half long and when
these superb arms are outspread radiating in every direction an
immense crownlike mass is formed which poised on the noble shaft and
filled with sunshine is one of the grandest forest objects conceivable
but though so wild and unconventional when full-grown the sugar pine
is a remarkably regular tree in youth a strict follower of coniferous
fashions slim erect tapering symmetrical every branch in place
at the age of fifty or sixty years this shy fashionable form begins to
give way special branches are thrust out away from the general outlines
of the trees and bent down with cones henceforth it becomes more and
more original and independent in style pushes boldly aloft into the
winds and sunshine growing ever more stately and beautiful a joy and
inspiration to every beholder

unfortunately the sugar pine makes excellent lumber it is too good
to live and is already passing rapidly away before the woodman's
axe surely out of all of the abounding forest wealth of oregon a few
specimens might be spared to the world not as dead lumber but as
living trees a park of moderate extent might be set apart and protected
for public use forever containing at least a few hundreds of each of
these noble pines spruces and firs happy will be the men who having
the power and the love and benevolent forecast to do this will do it
they will not be forgotten the trees and their lovers will sing their
praises and generations yet unborn will rise up and call them blessed

dotting the prairies and fringing the edges of the great evergreen
forests we find a considerable number of hardwood trees such as the
oak maple ash alder laurel madrone flowering dogwood wild cherry
and wild apple the white oak (quercus garryana) is the most important
of the oregon oaks as a timber tree but not nearly so beautiful as
kellogg's oak (q kelloggii) the former is found mostly along the
columbia river particularly about the dalles and a considerable
quantity of useful lumber is made from it and sold sometimes for
eastern white oak to wagon makers kellogg's oak is a magnificent tree
and does much for the picturesque beauty of the umpqua and rogue river
valleys where it abounds it is also found in all the yosemite valleys
of the sierra and its acorns form an important part of the food of
the digger indians in the siskiyou mountains there is a live oak (q
chrysolepis) wide-spreading and very picturesque in form but not very
common it extends southward along the western flank of the sierra and
is there more abundant and much larger than in oregon oftentimes five
to eight feet in diameter

the maples are the same as those in washington already described but
i have not seen any maple groves here equal in extent or in the size of
the trees to those on the snoqualmie river

the oregon ash is now rare along the stream banks of western oregon and
it grows to a good size and furnishes lumber that is for some purposes
equal to the white ash of the western states

nuttall's flowering dogwood makes a brave display with its wealth of
show involucres in the spring along cool streams specimens of the
flowers may be found measuring eight inches in diameter

the wild cherry (prunus emarginata var mollis) is a small handsome
tree seldom more than a foot in diameter at the base it makes valuable
lumber and its black astringent fruit furnishes a rich resource as
food for the birds a smaller form is common in the sierra the fruit of
which is eagerly eaten by the indians and hunters in time of need

the wild apple (pyrus rivularis) is a fine hearty handsome little tree
that grows well in rich cool soil along streams and on the edges
of beaver meadows from california through oregon and washington to
southeastern alaska in oregon it forms dense tangled thickets some
of them almost impenetrable the largest trunks are nearly a foot in
diameter when in bloom it makes a fine show with its abundant clusters
of flowers which are white and fragrant the fruit is very small and
savagely acid it is wholesome however and is eaten by birds bears
indians and many other adventurers great and small

passing from beneath the shadows of the woods where the trees grow close
and high we step into charming wild gardens full of lilies orchids
heathworts roses etc with colors so gay and forming such sumptuous
masses of bloom they make the gardens of civilization however lovingly
cared for seem pathetic and silly around the great fire-mountains
above the forests and beneath the snow there is a flowery zone
of marvelous beauty planted with anemones erythroniums daisies
bryanthus kalmia vaccinium cassiope saxifrages etc forming one
continuous garden fifty or sixty miles in circumference and so deep
and luxuriant and closely woven it seems as if nature glad to find
an opening were economizing space and trying to see how may of her
bright-eyed darlings she can get together in one mountain wreath

along the slopes of the cascades where the woods are less dense
especially about the headwaters of the willamette there are miles of
rhododendron making glorious outbursts of purple bloom and down on the
prairies in rich damp hollows the blue-flowered camassia grows in such
profusion that at a little distance its dense masses appear as beautiful
blue lakes imbedded in the green flowery plains while all about the
streams and the lakes and the beaver meadows and the margins of the deep
woods there is a magnificent tangle of gaultheria and huckleberry bushes
with their myriads of pink bells reinforced with hazel cornel rubus
of many species wild plum cherry and crab apple besides thousands
of charming bloomers to be found in all sorts of places throughout the
wilderness whose mere names are refreshing such as linnaea menziesia
pyrola chimaphila brodiaea smilacina fritillaria calochortus
trillium clintonia veratrum cypripedium goodyera spiranthes
habenaria and the rare and lovely "hider of the north" calypso
borealis to find which is alone a sufficient object for a journey into
the wilderness and besides these there is a charming underworld of
ferns and mosses flourishing gloriously beneath all the woods

everybody loves wild woods and flowers more or less seeds of all these
oregon evergreens and of many of the flowering shrubs and plants have
been sent to almost every country under the sun and they are now
growing in carefully tended parks and gardens and now that the ways of
approach are open one would expect to find these woods and gardens full
of admiring visitors reveling in their beauty like bees in a clover
field yet few care to visit them a portion of the bark of one of the
california trees the mere dead skin excited the wondering attention
of thousands when it was set up in the crystal palace in london as
did also a few peeled spars the shafts of mere saplings from oregon or
washington could one of these great silver firs or sugar pines three
hundred feet high have been transplanted entire to that exhibition how
enthusiastic would have been the praises accorded to it

nevertheless the countless hosts waving at home beneath their own
sky beside their own noble rivers and mountains and standing on a
flower-enameled carpet of mosses thousands of square miles in extent
attract but little attention most travelers content themselves with
what they may chance to see from car windows hotel verandas or the
deck of a steamer on the lower columbia clinging to the battered
highways like drowning sailors to a life raft when an excursion into
the woods is proposed all sorts of exaggerated or imaginary dangers are
conjured up filling the kindly soothing wilderness with colds fevers
indians bears snakes bugs impassable rivers and jungles of brush
to which is always added quick and sure starvation

as to starvation the woods are full of food and a supply of bread
may easily be carried for habit's sake and replenished now and then
at outlying farms and camps the indians are seldom found in the woods
being confined mainly to the banks of the rivers where the greater part
of their food is obtained moreover the most of them have been either
buried since the settlement of the country or civilized into comparative
innocence industry or harmless laziness there are bears in the
woods but not in such numbers nor of such unspeakable ferocity as
town-dwellers imagine nor do bears spend their lives in going about the
country like the devil seeking whom they may devour oregon bears like
most others have no liking for man either as meat or as society and
while some may be curious at times to see what manner of creature he is
most of them have learned to shun people as deadly enemies they have
been poisoned trapped and shot at until they have become shy and
it is no longer easy to make their acquaintance indeed since the
settlement of the country notwithstanding far the greater portion is
yet wild it is difficult to find any of the larger animals that once
were numerous and comparatively familiar such as the bear wolf
panther lynx deer elk and antelope

as early as 1843 while the settlers numbered only a few thousands and
before any sort of government had been organized they came together
and held what they called "a wolf meeting" at which a committee
was appointed to devise means for the destruction of wild animals
destructive to tame ones which committee in due time begged to report
as follows 

   it being admitted by all that bears wolves panthers etc are
   destructive to the useful animals owned by the settlers of this
   colony your committee would submit the following resolutions as
   the sense of this meeting by which the community may be governed
   in carrying on a defensive and destructive war on all such
   animals 

   resolved 1st that we deem it expedient for the community to take
   immediate measures for the destruction of all wolves panthers and
   bears and such other animals as are known to be destructive to
   cattle horses sheep and hogs

   2d that a bounty of fifty cents be paid for the destruction of a
   small wolf $300 for a large wolf $150 for a lynx $200 for a
   bear and $500 for a panther

this center of destruction was in the willamette valley but for
many years prior to the beginning of the operations of the "wolf
organization" the hudson's bay company had established forts and trading
stations over all the country wherever fur-gathering indians could be
found and vast numbers of these animals were killed their destruction
has since gone on at an accelerated rate from year to year as the
settlements have been extended so that in some cases it is difficult to
obtain specimens enough for the use of naturalists but even before any
of these settlements were made and before the coming of the hudson's
bay company there was very little danger to be met in passing through
this wilderness as far as animals were concerned and but little of
any kind as compared with the dangers encountered in crowded houses and
streets

when lewis and clark made their famous trip across the continent in
1804-05 when all the rocky mountain region was wild as well as the
pacific slope they did not lose a single man by wild animals nor
though frequently attacked especially by the grizzlies of the rocky
mountains were any of them wounded seriously captain clark was bitten
on the hand by a wolf as he lay asleep that was one bite among more
than a hundred men while traveling through eight to nine thousand miles
of savage wilderness they could hardly have been so fortunate had they
stayed at home they wintered on the edge of the clatsop plains on the
south side of the columbia river near its mouth in the woods on that
side they found game abundant especially elk and with the aid of
the friendly indians who furnished salmon and "wapatoo" (the tubers of
sagittaria variabilis) they were in no danger of starving

but on the return trip in the spring they reached the base of the rocky
mountains when the range was yet too heavily snow-laden to be crossed
with horses therefore they had to wait some weeks this was at the head
of one of the northern branches of the snake river and their scanty
stock of provisions being nearly exhausted the whole party was
compelled to live mostly on bears and dogs deer antelope and elk
usually abundant were now scarce because the region had been closely
hunted over by the indians before their arrival

lewis and clark had killed a number of bears and saved the skins of the
more interesting specimens and the variations they found in size color
of the hair etc made great difficulty in classification wishing to
get the opinion of the chopumish indians near one of whose villages
they were encamped concerning the various species the explorers
unpacked their bundles and spread out for examination all the skins they
had taken the indian hunters immediately classed the white the deep
and the pale grizzly red the grizzly dark-brown in short all those
with the extremities of the hair of a white or frosty color without
regard to the color of the ground or foil under the name of hoh-host
the indians assured them that these were all of the same species as the
white bear that they associated together had longer nails than the
others and never climbed trees on the other hand the black skins
those that were black with white hairs intermixed or with a white
breast the uniform bay the brown and the light reddish-brown were
classed under the name yack-ah and were said to resemble each other in
being smaller and having shorter nails in climbing trees and being so
little vicious that they could be pursued with safety

lewis and clark came to the conclusion that all those with white-tipped
hair found by them in the basin of the columbia belonged to the same
species as the grizzlies of the upper missouri and that the black and
reddish-brown etc of the rocky mountains belong to a second species
equally distinct from the grizzly and the black bear of the pacific
coast and the east which never vary in color

as much as possible should be made by the ordinary traveler of these
descriptions for he will be likely to see very little of any species
for himself not that bears no longer exist here but because being
shy they keep out of the way in order to see them and learn their
habits one must go softly and alone lingering long in the fringing
woods on the banks of the salmon streams and in the small openings in
the midst of thickets where berries are most abundant

as for rattlesnakes the other grand dread of town dwellers when they
leave beaten roads there are two or perhaps three species of them in
oregon but they are nowhere to be found in great numbers in western
oregon they are hardly known at all in all my walks in the oregon
forest i have never met a single specimen though a few have been seen
at long intervals

when the country was first settled by the whites fifty years ago the
elk roamed through the woods and over the plains to the east of
the cascades in immense numbers now they are rarely seen except by
experienced hunters who know their haunts in the deepest and most
inaccessible solitudes to which they have been driven so majestic
an animal forms a tempting mark for the sportsman's rifle countless
thousands have been killed for mere amusement and they already seem to
be nearing extinction as rapidly as the buffalo the antelope also is
vanishing from the columbia plains before the farmers and cattlemen
whether the moose still lingers in oregon or washington i am unable to
say

on the highest mountains of the cascade range the wild goat roams in
comparative security few of his enemies caring to go so far in pursuit
and to hunt on ground so high and dangerous he is a brave sturdy
shaggy mountaineer of an animal enjoying the freedom and security of
crumbling ridges and overhanging cliffs above the glaciers oftentimes
beyond the reach of the most daring hunter they seem to be as much
at home on the ice and snowfields as on the crags making their way in
flocks from ridge to ridge on the great volcanic mountains by crossing
the glaciers that lie between them traveling in single file guided
by an old experienced leader like a party of climbers on the alps on
these ice-journeys they pick their way through networks of crevasses
and over bridges of snow with admirable skill and the mountaineer may
seldom do better in such places than to follow their trail if he can
in the rich alpine gardens and meadows they find abundance of food
venturing sometimes well down in the prairie openings on the edge of
the timberline but holding themselves ever alert and watchful ready to
flee to their highland castles at the faintest alarm when their summer
pastures are buried beneath the winter snows they make haste to the
lower ridges seeking the wind-beaten crags and slopes where the snow
cannot lie at any great depth feeding at times on the leaves and twigs
of bushes when grass is beyond reach

the wild sheep is another admirable alpine rover but comparatively
rare in the oregon mountains choosing rather the drier ridges to the
southward on the cascades and to the eastward among the spurs of the
rocky mountain chain

deer give beautiful animation to the forests harmonizing finely in
their color and movements with the gray and brown shafts of the trees
and the swaying of the branches as they stand in groups at rest or
move gracefully and noiselessly over the mossy ground about the edges of
beaver meadows and flowery glades daintily culling the leaves and tips
of the mints and aromatic bushes on which they feed there are three
species the black-tailed white-tailed and mule deer the last being
restricted in its range to the open woods and plains to the eastward of
the cascades they are nowhere very numerous now killing for food for
hides or for mere wanton sport having well-nigh exterminated them in
the more accessible regions while elsewhere they are too often at the
mercy of the wolves

gliding about in their shady forest homes keeping well out of sight
there is a multitude of sleek fur-clad animals living and enjoying their
clean beautiful lives how beautiful and interesting they are is about
as difficult for busy mortals to find out as if their homes were beyond
sight in the sky hence the stories of every wild hunter and trapper
are eagerly listened to as being possibly true or partly so however
thickly clothed in successive folds of exaggeration and fancy
unsatisfying as these accounts must be a tourist's frightened rush and
scramble through the woods yields far less than the hunter's wildest
stories while in writing we can do but little more than to give a
few names as they come to mind beaver squirrel coon fox marten
fisher otter ermine wildcat only this instead of full descriptions
of the bright-eyed furry throng their snug home nests their fears
and fights and loves how they get their food rear their young escape
their enemies and keep themselves warm and well and exquisitely clean
through all the pitiless weather

for many years before the settlement of the country the fur of the
beaver brought a high price and therefore it was pursued with weariless
ardor not even in the quest for gold has a more ruthless desperate
energy been developed it was in those early beaver-days that the
striking class of adventurers called "free trappers" made their
appearance bold enterprising men eager to make money and inclined
at the same time to relish the license of a savage life would set forth
with a few traps and a gun and a hunting knife content at first to
venture only a short distance up the beaver streams nearest to the
settlements and where the indians were not likely to molest them there
they would set their traps while the buffalo antelope deer etc
furnished a royal supply of food in a few months their pack animals
would be laden with thousands of dollars' worth of fur

next season they would venture farther and again farther meanwhile
growing rapidly wilder getting acquainted with the indian tribes and
usually marrying among them thenceforward no danger could stay them
in their exciting pursuit wherever there were beaver they would go
however far or wild the wilder the better provided their scalps could
be saved oftentimes they were compelled to set their traps and
visit them by night and lie hid during the day when operating in the
neighborhood of hostile indians not then venturing to make a fire or
shoot game they lived on the raw flesh of the beaver perhaps seasoned
with wild cresses or berries then returning to the trading stations
they would spend their hard earnings in a few weeks of dissipation and
"good time" and go again to the bears and beavers until at length a
bullet or arrow would end all one after another would be missed by
some friend or trader at the autumn rendezvous reported killed by the
indians and forgotten some men of this class have from superior
skill or fortune escaped every danger lived to a good old age and
earned fame and by their knowledge of the topography of the vast
west then unexplored have been able to render important service to the
country but most of them laid their bones in the wilderness after a
few short keen seasons so great were the perils that beset them the
average length of the life of a "free trapper" has been estimated at
less than five years from the columbia waters beaver and beaver men
have almost wholly passed away and the men once so striking a part of
the view have left scarcely the faintest sign of their existence on the
other hand a thousand meadows on the mountains tell the story of the
beavers to remain fresh and green for many a century monuments of
their happy industrious lives

but there is a little airy elfin animal in these woods and in all
the evergreen woods of the pacific coast that is more influential and
interesting than even the beaver this is the douglas squirrel (sciurus
douglasi) go where you will throughout all these noble forests you
everywhere find this little squirrel the master-existence though only
a few inches long so intense is his fiery vigor and restlessness he
stirs every grove with wild life and makes himself more important than
the great bears that shuffle through the berry tangles beneath him
every tree feels the sting of his sharp feet nature has made him
master-forester and committed the greater part of the coniferous crops
to his management probably over half of all the ripe cones of the
spruces firs and pines are cut off and handled by this busy harvester
most of them are stored away for food through the winter and spring but
a part are pushed into shallow pits and covered loosely where some
of the seeds are no doubt left to germinate and grow up all the tree
squirrels are more or less birdlike in voice and movements but the
douglas is pre-eminently so possessing every squirrelish attribute
fully developed and concentrated he is the squirrel of squirrels
flashing from branch to branch of his favorite evergreens crisp and
glossy and sound as a sunbeam he stirs the leaves like a rustling
breeze darting across openings in arrowy lines launching in curves
glinting deftly from side to side in sudden zigzags and swirling in
giddy loops and spirals around the trunks now on his haunches now on
his head yet ever graceful and performing all his feats of strength and
skill without apparent effort one never tires of this bright spark of
life the brave little voice crying in the wilderness his varied piney
gossip is as savory to the air as balsam to the palate some of his
notes are almost flutelike in softness while others prick and tingle
like thistles he is the mockingbird of squirrels barking like a dog
screaming like a hawk whistling like a blackbird or linnet while in
bluff audacious noisiness he is a jay a small thing but filling and
animating all the woods

nor is there any lack of wings notwithstanding few are to be seen on
short noisy rambles the ousel sweetens the shady glens and canyons
where waterfalls abound and every grove or forest however silent
it may seem when we chance to pay it a hasty visit has its
singers thrushes linnets warblers while hummingbirds glint and
hover about the fringing masses of bloom around stream and meadow
openings but few of these will show themselves or sing their songs to
those who are ever in haste and getting lost going in gangs formidable
in color and accoutrements laughing hallooing breaking limbs off
the trees as they pass awkwardly struggling through briery thickets
entangled like blue-bottles in spider webs and stopping from time to
time to fire off their guns and pistols for the sake of the echoes
thus frightening all the life about them for miles it is this class of
hunters and travelers who report that there are "no birds in the woods
or game animals of any kind larger than mosquitoes"

besides the singing birds mentioned above the handsome oregon grouse
may be found in the thick woods also the dusky grouse and franklin's
grouse and in some places the beautiful mountain partridge or quail
the white-tailed ptarmigan lives on the lofty snow peaks above the
timber and the prairie chicken and sage cock on the broad columbia
plains from the cascade range back to the foothills of the rocky
mountains the bald eagle is very common along the columbia river or
wherever fish especially salmon are plentiful while swans herons
cranes pelicans geese ducks of many species and water birds in
general abound in the lake region on the main streams and along the
coast stirring the waters and sky into fine lively pictures greatly
to the delight of wandering lovers of wildness




xxiii the rivers of oregon


turning from the woods and their inhabitants to the rivers we find
that while the former are rarely seen by travelers beyond the immediate
borders of the settlements the great river of oregon draws crowds
of enthusiastic admirers to sound its praises every summer since the
completion of the first overland railroad tourists have been coming to
it in ever increasing numbers showing that in general estimation the
columbia is one of the chief attractions of the pacific coast and well
it deserves the admiration so heartily bestowed upon it the beauty
and majesty of its waters and the variety and grandeur of the scenery
through which it flows lead many to regard it as the most interesting
of all the great rivers of the continent notwithstanding the claims of
the other members of the family to which it belongs and which nobody can
measure the fraser mckenzie saskatchewan the missouri yellowstone
platte and the colorado with their glacier and geyser fountains their
famous canyons lakes forests and vast flowery prairies and plains
these great rivers and the columbia are intimately related all draw
their upper waters from the same high fountains on the broad rugged
uplift of the rocky mountains their branches interlacing like the
branches of trees they sing their first songs together on the heights
then collecting their tributaries they set out on their grand journey
to the atlantic pacific or arctic ocean

the columbia viewed as one from the sea to the mountains is like a
rugged broad-topped picturesque old oak about six hundred miles long
and nearly a thousand miles wide measured across the spread of its upper
branches the main limbs gnarled and swollen with lakes and lakelike
expansions while innumerable smaller lakes shine like fruit among the
smaller branches the main trunk extends back through the coast and
cascade mountains in a general easterly direction for three hundred
miles when it divides abruptly into two grand branches which bend off
to the northeastward and southeastward

the south branch the longer of the two called the snake or lewis
river extends into the rocky mountains as far as the yellowstone
national park where its head tributaries interlace with those of the
colorado missouri and yellowstone the north branch still called the
columbia extends through washington far into british territory its
highest tributaries reaching back through long parallel spurs of the
rockies between and beyond the headwaters of the fraser athabasca and
saskatchewan each of these main branches dividing again and again
spreads a network of channels over the vast complicated mass of the
great range throughout a section nearly a thousand miles in length
searching every fountain however small or great and gathering a
glorious harvest of crystal water to be rolled through forest and plain
in one majestic flood to the sea reinforced on the way by tributaries
that drain the blue mountains and more than two hundred miles of
the cascade and coast ranges though less than half as long as the
mississippi it is said to carry as much water the amount of its
discharge at different seasons however has never been exactly
measured but in time of flood its current is sufficiently massive and
powerful to penetrate the sea to a distance of fifty or sixty miles from
shore its waters being easily recognized by the difference in color
and by the drift of leaves berries pine cones branches and trunks of
trees that they carry

that so large a river as the columbia making a telling current so far
from shore should remain undiscovered while one exploring expedition
after another sailed past seems remarkable even after due allowance is
made for the cloudy weather that prevails hereabouts and the broad fence
of breakers drawn across the bar during the last few centuries when
the maps of the world were in great part blank the search for new
worlds was fashionable business and when such large game was no longer
to be found islands lying unclaimed in the great oceans inhabited
by useful and profitable people to be converted or enslaved became
attractive objects also new ways to india seas straits el dorados
fountains of youth and rivers that flowed over golden sands

those early explorers and adventurers were mostly brave enterprising
and after their fashion pious men in their clumsy sailing vessels
they dared to go where no chart or lighthouse showed the way where the
set of the currents the location of sunken outlying rocks and shoals
were all unknown facing fate and weather undaunted however dark the
signs heaving the lead and thrashing the men to their duty and trusting
to providence when a new shore was found on which they could land
they said their prayers with superb audacity fought the natives if they
cared to fight erected crosses and took possession in the names of
their sovereigns establishing claims such as they were to everything
in sight and beyond to be quarreled for and battled for and
passed from hand to hand in treaties and settlements made during the
intermissions of war

the branch of the river that bears the name of columbia all the way to
its head takes its rise in two lakes about ten miles in length that lie
between the selkirk and main ranges of the rocky mountains in british
columbia about eighty miles beyond the boundary line they are called
the upper and lower columbia lakes issuing from these the young river
holds a nearly straight course for a hundred and seventy miles in a
northwesterly direction to a plain called "boat encampment" receiving
many beautiful affluents by the way from the selkirk and main ranges
among which are the beaver-foot blackberry spill-e-mee-chene and gold
rivers at boat encampment it receives two large tributaries the canoe
river from the northwest a stream about a hundred and twenty miles
long and the whirlpool river from the north about a hundred and forty
miles in length

the whirlpool river takes its rise near the summit of the main axis of
the range on the fifty-fourth parallel and is the northmost of all
the columbia waters about thirty miles above its confluence with the
columbia it flows through a lake called the punch-bowl and thence it
passes between mounts hooker and brown said to be fifteen thousand
and sixteen thousand feet high making magnificent scenery though the
height of the mountains thereabouts has been considerably overestimated
from boat encampment the river now a large clear stream said to be
nearly a third of a mile in width doubles back on its original course
and flows southward as far as its confluence with the spokane in
washington a distance of nearly three hundred miles in a direct line
most of the way through a wild rocky picturesque mass of mountains
charmingly forested with pine and spruce though the trees seem
strangely small like second growth saplings to one familiar with the
western forests of washington oregon and california

about forty-five miles below boat encampment are the upper dalles or
dalles de mort and thirty miles farther the lower dalles where the
river makes a magnificent uproar and interrupts navigation about thirty
miles below the lower dalles the river expands into upper arrow lake a
beautiful sheet of water forty miles long and five miles wide straight
as an arrow and with the beautiful forests of the selkirk range rising
from its east shore and those of the gold range from the west at the
foot of the lake are the narrows a few miles in length and after these
rapids are passed the river enters lower arrow lake which is like the
upper arrow but is even longer and not so straight

a short distance below the lower arrow the columbia receives the
kootenay river the largest affluent thus far on its course and said to
be navigable for small steamers for a hundred and fifty miles it is
an exceedingly crooked stream heading beyond the upper columbia lakes
and in its mazy course flowing to all points of the compass it seems
lost and baffled in the tangle of mountain spurs and ridges it drains
measured around its loops and bends it is probably more than five
hundred miles in length it is also rich in lakes the largest kootenay
lake being upwards of seventy miles in length with an average width of
five miles a short distance below the confluence of the kootenay near
the boundary line between washington and british columbia another large
stream comes in from the east clarke's fork or the flathead river its
upper sources are near those of the missouri and south saskatchewan
and in its course it flows through two large and beautiful lakes the
flathead and the pend d'oreille all the lakes we have noticed thus far
would make charming places of summer resort but pend d'oreille
besides being surpassingly beautiful has the advantage of being
easily accessible since it is on the main line of the northern pacific
railroad in the territory of idaho in the purity of its waters it
reminds one of tahoe while its many picturesque islands crowned with
evergreens and its winding shores forming an endless variety of bays
and promontories lavishly crowded with spiry spruce and cedar recall
some of the best of the island scenery of alaska

about thirty-five miles below the mouth of clark's fork the columbia is
joined by the ne-whoi-al-pit-ku river from the northwest here too are
the great chaudiere or kettle falls on the main river with a total
descent of about fifty feet fifty miles farther down the spokane
river a clear dashing stream comes in from the east it is about one
hundred and twenty miles long and takes its rise in the beautiful lake
coeur d'alene in idaho which receives the drainage of nearly a hundred
miles of the western slopes of the bitter root mountains through the
st joseph and coeur d'alene rivers the lake is about twenty miles
long set in the midst of charming scenery and like pend d'oreille is
easy of access and is already attracting attention as a summer place for
enjoyment rest and health

the famous spokane falls are in washington about thirty miles below the
lake where the river is outspread and divided and makes a grand descent
from a level basaltic plateau giving rise to one of the most beautiful
as well as one of the greatest and most available of water-powers in
the state the city of the same name is built on the plateau along both
sides of the series of cascades and falls which rushing and sounding
through the midst give singular beauty and animation the young city is
also rushing and booming it is founded on a rock leveled and prepared
for it and its streets require no grading or paving as a power to
whirl the machinery of a great city and at the same time to train the
people to a love of the sublime and beautiful as displayed in
living water the spokane falls are unrivaled at least as far as my
observation has reached nowhere else have i seen such lessons given
by a river in the streets of a city such a glad exulting abounding
outgush crisp and clear from the mountains dividing falling
displaying its wealth calling aloud in the midst of the busy throng
and making glorious offerings for every use of utility or adornment

from the mouth of the spokane the columbia now out of the woods flows
to the westward with a broad stately current for a hundred and twenty
miles to receive the okinagan a large generous tributary a hundred and
sixty miles long coming from the north and drawing some of its waters
from the cascade range more than half its course is through a chain of
lakes the largest of which at the head of the river is over sixty miles
in length from its confluence with the okinagan the river pursues a
southerly course for a hundred and fifty miles most of the way through
a dreary treeless parched plain to meet the great south fork the
lewis or snake river is nearly a thousand miles long and drains nearly
the whole of idaho a territory rich in scenery gold mines flowery
grassy valleys and deserts while some of the highest tributaries reach
into wyoming utah and nevada throughout a great part of its course it
is countersunk in a black lava plain and shut in by mural precipices a
thousand feet high gloomy forbidding and unapproachable although the
gloominess of its canyon is relieved in some manner by its many falls
and springs some of the springs being large enough to appear as the
outlets of subterranean rivers they gush out from the faces of the
sheer black walls and descend foaming with brave roar and beauty to
swell the flood below

from where the river skirts the base of the blue mountains its
surroundings are less forbidding much of the country is fertile but
its canyon is everywhere deep and almost inaccessible steamers make
their way up as far as lewiston a hundred and fifty miles and receive
cargoes of wheat at different points through chutes that extend down
from the tops of the bluffs but though the hudson's bay company
navigated the north fork to its sources they depended altogether on
pack animals for the transportation of supplies and furs between the
columbia and fort hall on the head of the south fork which shows how
desperately unmanageable a river it must be

a few miles above the mouth of the snake the yakima which drains a
considerable portion of the cascade range enters from the northwest
it is about a hundred and fifty miles long but carries comparatively
little water a great part of what it sets out with from the base of
the mountains being consumed in irrigated fields and meadows in passing
through the settlements along its course and by evaporation on the
parched desert plains the grand flood of the columbia now from half a
mile to a mile wide sweeps on to the westward holding a nearly direct
course until it reaches the mouth of the willamette where it turns to
the northward and flows fifty miles along the main valley between the
coast and cascade ranges ere it again resumes its westward course to
the sea in all its course from the mouth of the yakima to the sea a
distance of three hundred miles the only considerable affluent from the
northward is the cowlitz which heads in the glaciers of mount rainier

from the south and east it receives the walla-walla and umatilla rather
short and dreary-looking streams though the plains they pass through
have proved fertile and their upper tributaries in the blue mountains
shaded with tall pines firs spruces and the beautiful oregon larch
(larix brevifolia) lead into a delightful region the john day river
also heads in the blue mountains and flows into the columbia sixty
miles below the mouth of the umatilla its valley is in great part
fertile and is noted for the interesting fossils discovered in it by
professor condon in sections cut by the river through the overlying lava
beds

the deschutes river comes in from the south about twenty miles below the
john day it is a large boisterous stream draining the eastern slope
of the cascade range for nearly two hundred miles and from the great
number of falls on the main trunk as well as on its many mountain
tributaries well deserves its name it enters the columbia with a grand
roar of falls and rapids and at times seems almost to rival the
main stream in the volume of water it carries near the mouth of the
deschutes are the falls of the columbia where the river passes a rough
bar of lava the descent is not great but the immense volume of water
makes a grand display during the flood season the falls are obliterated
and skillful boatmen pass over them in safety while the dalles some
six or eight miles below may be passed during low water but are
utterly impassable in flood time at the dalles the vast river is jammed
together into a long narrow slot of unknown depth cut sheer down in the
basalt

this slot or trough is about a mile and a half long and about sixty
yards wide at the narrowest place at ordinary times the river seems to
be set on edge and runs swiftly but without much noisy surging with a
descent of about twenty feet to the mile but when the snow is melting
on the mountains the river rises here sixty feet or even more during
extraordinary freshets and spreads out over a great breadth of massive
rocks through which have been cut several other gorges running parallel
with the one usually occupied all these inferior gorges now come into
use and the huge roaring torrent still rising and spreading at
length overwhelms the high jagged rock walls between them making
a tremendous display of chafing surging shattered currents
counter-currents and hollow whirls that no words can be made to
describe a few miles below the dalles the storm-tossed river gets
itself together again looks like water becomes silent and with
stately tranquil deliberation goes on its way out of the gray region
of sage and sand into the oregon woods thirty-five or forty miles below
the dalles are the cascades of the columbia where the river in passing
through the mountains makes another magnificent display of foaming
surging rapids which form the first obstruction to navigation from the
ocean a hundred and twenty miles distant this obstruction is to be
overcome by locks which are now being made

between the dalles and the cascades the river is like a lake a mile or
two wide lying in a valley or canyon about three thousand feet deep
the walls of the canyon lean well back in most places and leave here
and there small strips or bays of level ground along the water's
edge but towards the cascades and for some distance below them the
immediate banks are guarded by walls of columnar basalt which are worn
in many places into a great variety of bold and picturesque forms such
as the castle rock the rooster rock the pillars of hercules cape
horn etc while back of these rise the sublime mountain walls
forest-crowned and fringed more or less from top to base with pine
spruce and shaggy underbrush especially in the narrow gorges and
ravines where innumerable small streams come dancing and drifting down
misty and white to join the mighty river many of these falls on both
sides of the canyon of the columbia are far larger and more interesting
in every way than would be guessed from the slight glimpses one gets
of them while sailing past on the river or from the car windows the
multnomah falls are particularly interesting and occupy fern-lined
gorges of marvelous beauty in the basalt they are said to be about
eight hundred feet in height and at times of high water when the
mountain snows are melting are well worthy of a place beside the famous
falls of yosemite valley

according to an indian tradition the river of the cascades once flowed
through the basalt beneath a natural bridge that was broken down
during a mountain war when the old volcanoes hood and st helen's on
opposite sides of the river hurled rocks at each other thus forming
a dam that the river has been dammed here to some extent and within
a comparatively short period seems probable to say the least since
great numbers of submerged trees standing erect may be found along both
shores while as we have seen the whole river for thirty miles above
the cascades looks like a lake or mill-pond on the other hand it is
held by some that the submerged groves were carried into their places by
immense landslides

much of interest in the connection must necessarily be omitted for want
of space about forty miles below the cascades the river receives the
willamette the last of its great tributaries it is navigable for ocean
vessels as far as portland ten miles above its mouth and for river
steamers a hundred miles farther the falls of the willamette are
fifteen miles above portland where the river coming out of dense
woods breaks its way across a bar of black basalt and falls forty
feet in a passion of snowy foam showing to fine advantage against its
background of evergreens

of the fertility and beauty of the willamette all the world has heard
it lies between the cascade and coast ranges and is bounded on the
south by the calapooya mountains a cross-spur that separates it from
the valley of the umpqua

it was here the first settlements for agriculture were made and a
provisional government organized while the settlers isolated in the
far wilderness numbered only a few thousand and were laboring under the
opposition of the british government and the hudson's bay company eager
desire in the acquisition of territory on the part of these pioneer
state-builders was more truly boundless than the wilderness they were
in and their unconscionable patriotism was equaled only by their
belligerence for here while negotiations were pending for the location
of the northern boundary originated the celebrated "fifty-four forty or
fight" about as reasonable a war-cry as the "north pole or fight"
yet sad was the day that brought the news of the signing of the treaty
fixing their boundary along the forty-ninth parallel thus leaving the
little land-hungry settlement only a mere quarter-million of miles

as the willamette is one of the most foodful of valleys so is the
columbia one of the most foodful of rivers during the fisher's harvest
time salmon from the sea come in countless millions urging their way
against falls rapids and shallows up into the very heart of the rocky
mountains supplying everybody by the way with most bountiful masses of
delicious food weighing from twenty to eighty pounds each plump
and smooth like loaves of bread ready for the oven the supply seems
inexhaustible as well it might large quantities were used by the
indians as fuel and by the hudson's bay people as manure for their
gardens at the forts used wasted canned and sent in shiploads to all
the world a grand harvest was reaped every year while nobody sowed of
late however the salmon crop has begun to fail and millions of young
fry are now sown like wheat in the river every year from hatching
establishments belonging to the government

all of the oregon waters that win their way to the sea are a tributary
to the columbia save the short streams of the immediate coast and
the umpqua and rogue rivers in southern oregon these both head in the
cascade mountains and find their way to the sea through gaps in the
coast range and both drain large and fertile and beautiful valleys
rogue river valley is peculiarly attractive with a fine climate and
kindly productive soil the scenery is delightful about the main
central open portion of the basin dotted with picturesque groves of
oak there are many smaller valleys charmingly environed the whole
surrounded in the distance by the siskiyou coast umpqua and cascade
mountains besides the cereals nearly every sort of fruit flourishes
here and large areas are being devoted to peach apricot nectarine
and vine culture to me it seems above all others the garden valley of
oregon and the most delightful place for a home on the eastern rim of
the valley in the cascade mountains about sixty miles from medford in
a direct line is the remarkable crater lake usually regarded as the
one grand wonder of the region it lies in a deep sheer-walled basin
about seven thousand feet above the level of the sea supposed to be the
crater of an extinct volcano

oregon as it is today is a very young country though most of it seems
old contemplating the columbia sweeping from forest to forest across
plain and desert one is led to say of it as did byron of the ocean 

  "such as creation's dawn beheld thou rollest now"

how ancient appear the crumbling basaltic monuments along its banks and
the gray plains to the east of the cascades nevertheless the river
as well as its basin in anything like their present condition are
comparatively but of yesterday looming no further back in the
geological records than the tertiary period the oregon of that time
looks altogether strange in the few suggestive glimpses we may get of
it forests in which palm trees wave their royal crowns and strange
animals roaming beneath them or about the reedy margins of lakes the
oreodon the lophiodon and several extinct species of the horse the
camel and other animals

then came the fire period with its darkening showers of ashes and
cinders and its vast floods of molten lava making quite another oregon
from the fair and fertile land of the preceding era and again while
yet the volcanic fires show signs of action in the smoke and flame of
the higher mountains the whole region passes under the dominion of ice
and from the frost and darkness and death of the glacial period oregon
has but recently emerged to the kindly warmth and life of today




xxiv the grand canyon of the colorado


happy nowadays is the tourist with earth's wonders new and old spread
invitingly open before him and a host of able workers as his slaves
making everything easy padding plush about him grading roads for him
boring tunnels moving hills out of his way eager like the devil to
show him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory and foolishness
spiritualizing travel for him with lightning and steam abolishing space
and time and almost everything else little children and tender
pulpy people as well as storm-seasoned explorers may now go almost
everywhere in smooth comfort cross oceans and deserts scarce accessible
to fishes and birds and dragged by steel horses go up high mountains
riding gloriously beneath starry showers of sparks ascending like
elijah in a whirlwind and chariot of fire

first of the wonders of the great west to be brought within reach of the
tourist were the yosemite and the big trees on the completion of
the first transcontinental railway next came the yellowstone and
icy alaska by the northern roads and last the grand canyon of the
colorado which naturally the hardest to reach has now become by a
branch of the santa fe the most accessible of all

of course with this wonderful extension of steel ways through our
wildness there is loss as well as gain nearly all railroads are
bordered by belts of desolation the finest wilderness perishes as if
stricken with pestilence bird and beast people if not the dryads are
frightened from the groves too often the groves also vanish leaving
nothing but ashes fortunately nature has a few big places beyond man's
power to spoil the ocean the two icy ends of the globe and the grand
canyon

when i first heard of the santa fe trains running to the edge of
the grand canyon of arizona i was troubled with thoughts of the
disenchantment likely to follow but last winter when i saw those
trains crawling along through the pines of the coconino forest and close
up to the brink of the chasm at bright angel i was glad to discover
that in the presence of such stupendous scenery they are nothing the
locomotives and trains are mere beetles and caterpillars and the noise
they make is as little disturbing as the hooting of an owl in the lonely
woods

in a dry hot monotonous forested plateau seemingly boundless you
come suddenly and without warning upon the abrupt edge of a gigantic
sunken landscape of the wildest most multitudinous features and those
features sharp and angular are made out of flat beds of limestone and
sandstone forming a spiry jagged gloriously colored mountain range
countersunk in a level gray plain it is a hard job to sketch it even in
scrawniest outline and try as i may not in the least sparing myself
i cannot tell the hundredth part of the wonders of its features the
side canyons gorges alcoves cloisters and amphitheaters of vast
sweep and depth carved in its magnificent walls the throng of great
architectural rocks it contains resembling castles cathedrals temples
and palaces towered and spired and painted some of them nearly a mile
high yet beneath one's feet all this however is less difficult than
to give any idea of the impression of wild primeval beauty and power
one receives in merely gazing from its brink the view down the gulf of
color and over the rim of its wonderful wall more than any other view
i know leads us to think of our earth as a star with stars swimming in
light every radiant spire pointing the way to the heavens

but it is impossible to conceive what the canyon is or what impression
it makes from descriptions or pictures however good naturally it is
untellable even to those who have seen something perhaps a little like
it on a small scale in this same plateau region one's most extravagant
expectations are indefinitely surpassed though one expects much from
what is said of it as "the biggest chasm on earth" "so big is it
that all other big things yosemite the yellowstone the pyramids
chicago all would be lost if tumbled into it" naturally enough
illustrations as to size are sought for among other canyons like or
unlike it with the common result of worse confounding confusion the
prudent keep silence it was once said that the "grand canyon could put
a dozen yosemites in its vest pocket"

the justly famous grand canyon of the yellowstone is like the colorado
gorgeously colored and abruptly countersunk in a plateau and both
are mainly the work of water but the colorado's canyon is more than
a thousand times larger and as a score or two of new buildings of
ordinary size would not appreciably change the general view of a great
city so hundreds of yellowstones might be eroded in the sides of the
colorado canyon without noticeably augmenting its size or the richness
of its sculpture

but it is not true that the great yosemite rocks would be thus lost or
hidden nothing of their kind in the world so far as i know rivals
el capitan and tissiack much less dwarfs or in any way belittles them
none of the sandstone or limestone precipices of the canyon that i have
seen or heard of approaches in smooth flawless strength and grandeur
the granite face of el capitan or the tenaya side of cloud's rest these
colossal cliffs types of permanence are about three thousand and six
thousand feet high those of the canyon that are sheer are about half as
high and are types of fleeting change while glorious-domed tissiack
noblest of mountain buildings far from being overshadowed or lost in
this rosy spiry canyon company would draw every eye and in serene
majesty "aboon them a'" she would take her place castle temple
palace or tower nevertheless a noted writer comparing the grand
canyon in a general way with the glacial yosemite says "and the
yosemite ah the lovely yosemite dumped down into the wilderness of
gorges and mountains it would take a guide who knew of its existence
a long time to find it" this is striking and shows up well above the
levels of commonplace description but it is confusing and has the
fatal fault of not being true as well try to describe an eagle by
putting a lark in it "and the lark ah the lovely lark dumped down
the red royal gorge of the eagle it would be hard to find" each in
its own place is better singing at heaven's gate and sailing the sky
with the clouds

every feature of nature's big face is beautiful height and hollow
wrinkle furrow and line and this is the main master-furrow of its
kind on our continent incomparably greater and more impressive than any
other yet discovered or likely to be discovered now that all the great
rivers have been traced to their heads

the colorado river rises in the heart of the continent on the dividing
ranges and ridges between the two oceans drains thousands of snowy
mountains through narrow or spacious valleys and thence through
canyons of every color sheer-walled and deep all of which seem to be
represented in this one grand canyon of canyons

it is very hard to give anything like an adequate conception of its
size much more of its color its vast wall-sculpture the wealth
of ornate architectural buildings that fill it or most of all the
tremendous impression it makes according to major powell it is about
two hundred and seventeen miles long from five to fifteen miles wide
from rim to rim and from about five thousand to six thousand feet deep
so tremendous a chasm would be one of the world's greatest wonders even
if like ordinary canyons cut in sedimentary rocks it were empty and
its walls were simple but instead of being plain the walls are so
deeply and elaborately carved into all sorts of recesses alcoves
cirques amphitheaters and side canyons that were you to trace
the rim closely around on both sides your journey would be nearly a
thousand miles long into all these recesses the level continuous beds
of rock in ledges and benches with their various colors run like broad
ribbons marvelously beautiful and effective even at a distance of
ten or twelve miles and the vast space these glorious walls enclose
instead of being empty is crowded with gigantic architectural rock
forms gorgeously colored and adorned with towers and spires like works
of art

looking down from this level plateau we are more impressed with a
feeling of being on the top of everything than when looking from the
summit of a mountain from side to side of the vast gulf temples
palaces towers and spires come soaring up in thick array half a mile
or nearly a mile above their sunken hidden bases some to a level with
our standpoint but none higher and in the inspiring morning light all
are so fresh and rosy-looking that they seem new-born as if like the
quick-growing crimson snowplants of the california woods they had just
sprung up hatched by the warm brooding motherly weather

in trying to describe the great pines and sequoias of the sierra i have
often thought that if one of these trees could be set by itself in some
city park its grandeur might there be impressively realized while in
its home forests where all magnitudes are great the weary satiated
traveler sees none of them truly it is so with these majestic rock
structures

though mere residual masses of the plateau they are dowered with the
grandeur and repose of mountains together with the finely chiseled
carving and modeling of man's temples and palaces and often to a
considerable extent with their symmetry some closely observed look
like ruins but even these stand plumb and true and show architectural
forms loaded with lines strictly regular and decorative and all are
arrayed in colors that storms and time seem only to brighten they
are not placed in regular rows in line with the river but "a' through
ither" as the scotch say in lavish exuberant crowds as if nature
in wildest extravagance held her bravest structures as common as
gravel-piles yonder stands a spiry cathedral nearly five thousand feet
in height nobly symmetrical with sheer buttressed walls and arched
doors and windows as richly finished and decorated with sculptures as
the great rock temples of india or egypt beside it rises a huge castle
with arched gateway turrets watch-towers ramparts etc and to
right and left palaces obelisks and pyramids fairly fill the gulf
all colossal and all lavishly painted and carved here and there a
flat-topped structure may be seen or one imperfectly domed but the
prevailing style is ornate gothic with many hints of egyptian and
indian

throughout this vast extent of wild architecture nature's own capital
city there seem to be no ordinary dwellings all look like grand and
important public structures except perhaps some of the lower pyramids
broad-based and sharp-pointed covered with down-flowing talus like
loosely set tents with hollow sagging sides the roofs often have
disintegrated rocks heaped and draggled over them but in the main the
masonry is firm and laid in regular courses as if done by square and
rule

nevertheless they are ever changing their tops are now a dome now a
flat table or a spire as harder or softer strata are reached in their
slow degradation while the sides with all their fine moldings are
being steadily undermined and eaten away but no essential change in
style or color is thus effected from century to century they stand
the same what seems confusion among the rough earthquake-shaken crags
nearest one comes to order as soon as the main plan of the various
structures appears every building however complicated and laden with
ornamental lines is at one with itself and every one of its neighbors
for the same characteristic controlling belts of color and solid strata
extend with wonderful constancy for very great distances and pass
through and give style to thousands of separate structures however
their smaller characters may vary

of all the various kinds of ornamental work displayed carving tracery
on cliff faces moldings arches pinnacles none is more admirably
effective or charms more than the webs of rain-channeled taluses
marvelously extensive without the slightest appearance of waste or
excess they cover roofs and dome tops and the base of every cliff
belt each spire and pyramid and massy towering temple and in beautiful
continuous lines go sweeping along the great walls in and out around
all the intricate system of side canyons amphitheaters cirques and
scallops into which they are sculptured from one point hundreds of
miles of the fairy embroidery may be traced it is all so fine and
orderly that it would seem that not only had the clouds and streams been
kept harmoniously busy in the making of it but that every raindrop sent
like a bullet to a mark had been the subject of a separate thought
so sure is the outcome of beauty through the stormy centuries surely
nowhere else are there illustrations so striking of the natural beauty
of desolation and death so many of nature's own mountain buildings
wasting in glory of high desert air going to dust see how steadfast in
beauty they all are in their going look again and again how the rough
dusty boulders and sand of disintegration from the upper ledges wreathe
in beauty for ashes as in the flowers of a prairie after fires but
here the very dust and ashes are beautiful

gazing across the mighty chasm we at last discover that it is not its
great depth nor length nor yet these wonderful buildings that most
impresses us it is its immense width sharply defined by precipitous
walls plunging suddenly down from a flat plain declaring in terms
instantly apprehended that the vast gulf is a gash in the once unbroken
plateau made by slow orderly erosion and removal of huge beds of
rocks other valleys of erosion are as great in all their dimensions
some are greater but none of these produces an effect on the
imagination at once so quick and profound coming without study given
at a glance therefore by far the greatest and most influential feature
of this view from bright angel or any other of the canyon views is
the opposite wall of the one beneath our feet we see only fragmentary
sections in cirques and amphitheaters and on the sides of the
out-jutting promontories between them while the other though far
distant is beheld in all its glory of color and noble proportions the
one supreme beauty and wonder to which the eye is ever turning for
while charming with its beauty it tells the story of the stupendous
erosion of the canyon the foundation of the unspeakable impression made
on everybody it seems a gigantic statement for even nature to make
all in one mighty stone word apprehended at once like a burst of light
celestial color its natural vesture coming in glory to mind and heart
as to a home prepared for it from the very beginning wildness so
godful cosmic primeval bestows a new sense of earth's beauty and
size not even from high mountains does the world seem so wide so like
a star in glory of light on its way through the heavens

i have observed scenery-hunters of all sorts getting first views
of yosemites glaciers white mountain ranges etc mixed with the
enthusiasm which such scenery naturally excites there is often weak
gushing and many splutter aloud like little waterfalls here for a few
moments at least there is silence and all are in dead earnest as
if awed and hushed by an earthquake perhaps until the cook cries
"breakfast" or the stable-boy "horses are ready" then the poor
unfortunates slaves of regular habits turn quickly away gasping and
muttering as if wondering where they had been and what had enchanted
them

roads have been made from bright angel hotel through the coconino forest
to the ends of outstanding promontories commanding extensive views up
and down the canyon the nearest of them three or four miles east
and west are o'neill's point and rowe's point the latter besides
commanding the eternally interesting canyon gives wide-sweeping views
southeast and west over the dark forest roof to the san francisco and
mount trumbull volcanoes the bluest of mountains over the blackest of
level woods

instead of thus riding in dust with the crowd more will be gained by
going quietly afoot along the rim at different times of day and night
free to observe the vegetation the fossils in the rocks the seams
beneath overhanging ledges once inhabited by indians and to watch the
stupendous scenery in the changing lights and shadows clouds showers
and storms one need not go hunting the so-called "points of interest"
the verge anywhere everywhere is a point of interest beyond one's
wildest dreams

as yet few of the promontories or throng of mountain buildings in the
canyon are named nor among such exuberance of forms are names thought
of by the bewildered hurried tourist he would be as likely to think
of names for waves in a storm the eastern and western cloisters hindu
amphitheater cape royal powell's plateau grand view point point
sublime bissell and moran points the temple of set vishnu's temple
shiva's temple twin temples tower of babel hance's column these
fairly good names given by dutton holmes moran and others are
scattered over a large stretch of the canyon wilderness

all the canyon rock-beds are lavishly painted except a few neutral bars
and the granite notch at the bottom occupied by the river which makes
but little sign it is a vast wilderness of rocks in a sea of light
colored and glowing like oak and maple woods in autumn when the
sun-gold is richest i have just said that it is impossible to learn
what the canyon is like from descriptions and pictures powell's and
dutton's descriptions present magnificent views not only of the canyon
but of all the grand region round about it and holmes's drawings
accompanying dutton's report are wonderfully good surely faithful and
loving skill can go no farther in putting the multitudinous decorated
forms on paper but the colors the living rejoicing colors chanting
morning and evening in chorus to heaven whose brush or pencil however
lovingly inspired can give us these? and if paint is of no effect what
hope lies in pen-work? only this some may be incited by it to go and
see for themselves

no other range of mountainous rock-work of anything like the same extent
have i seen that is so strangely boldly lavishly colored the famous
yellowstone canyon below the falls comes to mind but wonderful as it
is and well deserved as is its fame compared with this it is only a
bright rainbow ribbon at the roots of the pines each of the series of
level continuous beds of carboniferous rocks of the canyon has as we
have seen its own characteristic color the summit limestone beds
are pale yellow next below these are the beautiful rose-colored
cross-bedded sandstones next there are a thousand feet of brilliant red
sandstones and below these the red wall limestones over two thousand
feet thick rich massy red the greatest and most influential of the
series and forming the main color-fountain between these are many
neutral-tinted beds the prevailing colors are wonderfully deep and
clear changing and blending with varying intensity from hour to hour
day to day season to season throbbing wavering glowing responding
to every passing cloud or storm a world of color in itself now burning
in separate rainbow bars streaked and blotched with shade now glowing
in one smooth all-pervading ethereal radiance like the alpenglow
uniting the rocky world with the heavens

the dawn as in all the pure dry desert country is ineffably beautiful
and when the first level sunbeams sting the domes and spires with what
a burst of power the big wild days begin the dead and the living
rocks and hearts alike awake and sing the new-old song of creation
all the massy headlands and salient angles of the walls and the
multitudinous temples and palaces seem to catch the light at once and
cast thick black shadows athwart hollow and gorge bringing out details
as well as the main massive features of the architecture while all the
rocks as if wild with life throb and quiver and glow in the glorious
sunburst rejoicing every rock temple then becomes a temple of music
every spire and pinnacle an angel of light and song shouting color
hallelujahs

as the day draws to a close shadows wondrous black and thick like
those of the morning fill up the wall hollows while the glowing rocks
their rough angles burned off seem soft and hot to the heart as they
stand submerged in purple haze which now fills the canyon like a sea
still deeper richer more divine grow the great walls and temples
until in the supreme flaming glory of sunset the whole canyon is
transfigured as if all the life and light of centuries of sunshine
stored up and condensed in the rocks was now being poured forth as from
one glorious fountain flooding both earth and sky

strange to say in the full white effulgence of the midday hours the
bright colors grow dim and terrestrial in common gray haze and the
rocks after the manner of mountains seem to crouch and drowse and
shrink to less than half their real stature and have nothing to say to
one as if not at home but it is fine to see how quickly they come
to life and grow radiant and communicative as soon as a band of white
clouds come floating by as if shouting for joy they seem to spring
up to meet them in hearty salutation eager to touch them and beg their
blessings it is just in the midst of these dull midday hours that the
canyon clouds are born

a good storm cloud full of lightning and rain on its way to its work on
a sunny desert day is a glorious object across the canyon opposite the
hotel is a little tributary of the colorado called bright angel creek
a fountain-cloud still better deserves the name "angel of the desert
wells" clad in bright plumage carrying cool shade and living water to
countless animals and plants ready to perish noble in form and gesture
seeming able for anything pouring life-giving wonder-working floods
from its alabaster fountains as if some sky-lake had broken to every
gulch and gorge on its favorite ground is given a passionate torrent
roaring replying to the rejoicing lightning stones tons in weight
hurrying away as if frightened showing something of the way grand
canyon work is done most of the fertile summer clouds of the canyon
are of this sort massive swelling cumuli growing rapidly displaying
delicious tones of purple and gray in the hollows of their sun-beaten
houses showering favored areas of the heated landscape and vanishing
in an hour or two some busy and thoughtful-looking glide with
beautiful motion along the middle of the canyon in flocks turning aside
here and there lingering as if studying the needs of particular
spots exploring side canyons peering into hollows like birds seeding
nest-places or hovering aloft on outspread wings they scan all the red
wilderness dispensing their blessings of cool shadows and rain where
the need is the greatest refreshing the rocks their offspring as well
as the vegetation continuing their sculpture deepening gorges and
sharpening peaks sometimes blending all together they weave a ceiling
from rim to rim perhaps opening a window here and there for sunshine
to stream through suddenly lighting some palace or temple and making it
flare in the rain as if on fire

sometimes as one sits gazing from a high jutting promontory the sky
all clear showing not the slightest wisp or penciling a bright band of
cumuli will appear suddenly coming up the canyon in single file as if
tracing a well-known trail passing in review each in turn darting its
lances and dropping its shower making a row of little vertical rivers
in the air above the big brown one others seem to grow from mere
points and fly high above the canyon yet following its course for a
long time noiseless as if hunting then suddenly darting lightning at
unseen marks and hurrying on or they loiter here and there as if idle
like laborers out of work waiting to be hired

half a dozen or more showers may oftentimes be seen falling at once
while far the greater part of the sky is in sunshine and not a raindrop
comes nigh one these thundershowers from as many separate clouds
looking like wisps of long hair may vary greatly in effects the
pale faint streaks are showers that fail to reach the ground being
evaporated on the way down through the dry thirsty air like streams
in deserts many on the other hand which in the distance seem
insignificant are really heavy rain however local these are the gray
wisps well zigzagged with lightning the darker ones are torrent rain
which on broad steep slopes of favorable conformation give rise to
so-called "cloudbursts" and wonderful is the commotion they cause the
gorges and gulches below them usually dry break out in loud uproar
with a sudden downrush of muddy boulder-laden floods down they all go
in one simultaneous gush roaring like lions rudely awakened each of
the tawny brood actually kicking up a dust at the first onset

during the winter months snow falls over all the high plateau usually
to a considerable depth whitening the rim and the roofs of the canyon
buildings but last winter when i arrived at bright angel in the middle
of january there was no snow in sight and the ground was dry greatly
to my disappointment for i had made the trip mainly to see the
canyon in its winter garb soothingly i was informed that this was an
exceptional season and that the good snow might arrive at any time
after waiting a few days i gladly hailed a broad-browed cloud coming
grandly on from the west in big promising blackness very unlike the
white sailors of the summer skies under the lee of a rim-ledge with
another snow-lover i watched its movements as it took possession of the
canyon and all the adjacent region in sight trailing its gray fringes
over the spiry tops of the great temples and towers it gradually
settled lower embracing them all with ineffable kindness and gentleness
of touch and fondled the little cedars and pines as they quivered
eagerly in the wind like young birds begging their mothers to feed them
the first flakes and crystals began to fly about noon sweeping straight
up the middle of the canyon and swirling in magnificent eddies along
the sides gradually the hearty swarms closed their ranks and all the
canyon was lost in gray bloom except a short section of the wall and a
few trees beside us which looked glad with snow in their needles and
about their feet as they leaned out over the gulf suddenly the storm
opened with magical effect to the north over the canyon of bright angel
creek inclosing a sunlit mass of the canyon architecture spanned
by great white concentric arches of cloud like the bows of a silvery
aurora above these and a little back of them was a series of upboiling
purple clouds and high above all in the background a range of noble
cumuli towered aloft like snow-laden mountains their pure pearl bosses
flooded with sunshine the whole noble picture calmly glowing was
framed in thick gray gloom which soon closed over it and the storm
went on opening and closing until night covered all

two days later when we were on a jutting point about eighteen miles
east of bright angel and one thousand feet higher we enjoyed another
storm of equal glory as to cloud effects though only a few inches of
snow fell before the storm began we had a magnificent view of this
grander upper part of the canyon and also of the coconino forest and the
painted desert the march of the clouds with their storm banners flying
over this sublime landscape was unspeakably glorious and so also was
the breaking up of the storm next morning the mingling of silver-capped
rock sunshine and cloud

most tourists make out to be in a hurry even here therefore their days
or hours would be best spent on the promontories nearest the hotel yet
a surprising number go down the bright angel trail to the brink of the
inner gloomy granite gorge overlooking the river deep canyons attract
like high mountains the deeper they are the more surely are we drawn
into them on foot of course there is no danger whatever and with
ordinary precautions but little on animals in comfortable tourist
faith unthinking unfearing down go men women and children on
whatever is offered horse mule or burro as if saying with jean paul
"fear nothing but fear" not without reason for these canyon trails
down the stairways of the gods are less dangerous than they seem less
dangerous than home stairs the guides are cautious and so are the
experienced much-enduring beasts the scrawniest rosinantes and
wizened-rat mules cling hard to the rocks endwise or sidewise like
lizards or ants from terrace to terrace climate to climate down one
creeps in sun and shade through gorge and gully and grassy ravine and
after a long scramble on foot at last beneath the mighty cliffs one
comes to the grand roaring river

to the mountaineer the depth of the canyon from five thousand to
six thousand feet will not seem so very wonderful for he has often
explored others that are about as deep but the most experienced will be
awestruck by the vast extent of huge rock monuments of pointed masonry
built up in regular courses towering above beneath and round about
him by the bright angel trail the last fifteen hundred feet of the
descent to the river has to be made afoot down the gorge of indian
garden creek most of the visitors do not like this part and are
content to stop at the end of the horse trail and look down on the
dull-brown flood from the edge of the indian garden plateau by the new
hance trail excepting a few daringly steep spots you can ride all
the way to the river where there is a good spacious camp-ground in a
mesquite grove this trail built by brave hance begins on the highest
part of the rim eight thousand feet above the sea a thousand feet
higher than the head of bright angel trail and the descent is a little
over six thousand feet through a wonderful variety of climate and life
often late in the fall when frosty winds are blowing and snow is flying
at one end of the trail tender plants are blooming in balmy summer
weather at the other the trip down and up can be made afoot easily in
a day in this way one is free to observe the scenery and vegetation
instead of merely clinging to his animal and watching its steps but
all who have time should go prepared to camp awhile on the riverbank
to rest and learn something about the plants and animals and the mighty
flood roaring past in cool shady amphitheaters at the head of the
trail there are groves of white silver fir and douglas spruce with
ferns and saxifrages that recall snowy mountains below these yellow
pine nut pine juniper hop-hornbeam ash maple holly-leaved
berberis cowania spiraea dwarf oak and other small shrubs and
trees in dry gulches and on taluses and sun-beaten crags are sparsely
scattered yuccas cactuses agave etc where springs gush from the
rocks there are willow thickets grassy flats and bright flowery
gardens and in the hottest recesses the delicate abronia mesquite
woody compositae and arborescent cactuses

the most striking and characteristic part of this widely varied
vegetation are the cactaceae strange leafless old-fashioned plants
with beautiful flowers and fruit in every way able and admirable while
grimly defending themselves with innumerable barbed spears they offer
both food and drink to man and beast their juicy globes and disks and
fluted cylindrical columns are almost the only desert wells that never
go dry and they always seem to rejoice the more and grow plumper and
juicier the hotter the sunshine and sand some are spherical like
rolled-up porcupines crouching in rock-hollows beneath a mist of gray
lances unmoved by the wildest winds others standing as erect as
bushes and trees or tall branchless pillars crowned with magnificent
flowers their prickly armor sparkling look boldly abroad over the
glaring desert making the strangest forests ever seen or dreamed of
cereus giganteus the grim chief of the desert tribe is often thirty or
forty feet high in southern arizona several species of tree yuccas in
the same desert laden in early spring with superb white lilies form
forests hardly less wonderful though here they grow singly or in small
lonely groves the low almost stemless yucca baccata with beautiful
lily flowers and sweet banana-like fruit prized by the indians
is common along the canyon rim growing on lean rocky soil beneath
mountain mahogany nut pines and junipers beside dense flowery mats of
spiraea caespitosa and the beautiful pinnate-leaved spiraea millefolia
the nut pine (pinus edulis) scattered along the upper slopes and roofs
of the canyon buildings is the principal tree of the strange dwarf
coconino forest it is a picturesque stub of a pine about twenty-five
feet high usually with dead lichened limbs thrust through its rounded
head and grows on crags and fissured rock tables braving heat and
frost snow and drought and continuing patiently faithfully fruitful
for centuries indians and insects and almost every desert bird and
beast come to it to be fed

to civilized people from corn and cattle and wheat-field countries the
canyon at first sight seems as uninhabitable as a glacier crevasse
utterly silent and barren nevertheless it is the home of the multitude
of our fellow-mortals men as well as animals and plants centuries ago
it was inhabited by tribes of indians who long before columbus saw
america built thousands of stone houses in its crags and large ones
some of them several stories high with hundreds of rooms on the mesas
of the adjacent regions their cliff-dwellings almost numberless are
still to be seen in the canyon scattered along both sides from top to
bottom and throughout its entire length built of stone and mortar
in seams and fissures like swallows' nests or on isolated ridges and
peaks the ruins of larger buildings are found on open spots by the
river but most of them aloft on the brink of the wildest giddiest
precipices sites evidently chosen for safety from enemies and
seemingly accessible only to the birds of the air many caves were also
used as dwelling-places as were mere seams on cliff-fronts formed by
unequal weathering and with or without outer or side walls and some of
them were covered with colored pictures of animals the most interesting
of these cliff-dwellings had pathetic little ribbon-like strips of
garden on narrow terraces where irrigating water could be carried to
them most romantic of sky-gardens but eloquent of hard times

in recesses along the river and on the first plateau flats above its
gorge were fields and gardens of considerable size where irrigating
ditches may still be traced some of these ancient gardens are still
cultivated by indians descendants of cliff-dwellers who raise corn
squashes melons potatoes etc to reinforce the produce of the many
wild food-furnishing plants nuts beans berries yucca and cactus
fruits grass and sunflower seeds etc and the flesh of animals deer
rabbits lizards etc the canyon indians i have met here seem to
be living much as did their ancestors though not now driven into
rock-dens they are able erect men with commanding eyes which nothing
that they wish to see can escape they are never in a hurry have a
strikingly measured deliberate bearish manner of moving the limbs and
turning the head are capable of enduring weather thirst hunger
and over-abundance and are blessed with stomachs which triumph over
everything the wilderness may offer evidently their lives are not
bitter

the largest of the canyon animals one is likely to see is the wild
sheep or rocky mountain bighorn a most admirable beast with limbs
that never fail at home on the most nerve-trying precipices acquainted
with all the springs and passes and broken-down jumpable places in
the sheer ribbon cliffs bounding from crag to crag in easy grace and
confidence of strength his great horns held high above his shoulders
wild red blood beating and hissing through every fiber of him like the
wind through a quivering mountain pine

deer also are occasionally met in the canyon making their way to the
river when the wells of the plateau are dry along the short spring
streams beavers are still busy as is shown by the cottonwood and willow
timber they have cut and peeled found in all the river drift-heaps
in the most barren cliffs and gulches there dwell a multitude of lesser
animals well-dressed clear-eyed happy little beasts wood rats
kangaroo rats gophers wood mice skunks rabbits bobcats and many
others gathering food or dozing in their sun-warmed dens lizards
too of every kind and color are here enjoying life on the hot cliffs
and making the brightest of them brighter

nor is there any lack of feathered people the golden eagle may be seen
and the osprey hawks jays hummingbirds the mourning dove and cheery
familiar singers the black-headed grosbeak robin bluebird townsend's
thrush and many warblers sailing the sky and enlivening the rocks and
bushes through all the canyon wilderness

here at hance's river camp or a few miles above it brave powell and
his brave men passed their first night in the canyon on the adventurous
voyage of discovery thirty-three [34] years ago they faced a thousand
dangers open or hidden now in their boats gladly sliding down swift
smooth reaches now rolled over and over in back-combing surges of
rough roaring cataracts sucked under in eddies swimming like beavers
tossed and beaten like castaway drift stout-hearted undaunted doing
their work through it all after a month of this they floated smoothly
out of the dark gloomy roaring abyss into light and safety two hundred
miles below as the flood rushes past us heavy-laden with desert
mud we naturally think of its sources its countless silvery branches
outspread on thousands of snowy mountains along the crest of the
continent and the life of them the beauty of them their history
and romance its topmost springs are far north and east in wyoming and
colorado on the snowy wind river front park and sawatch ranges
dividing the two ocean waters and the elk wahsatch uinta and
innumerable spurs streaked with streams made famous by early explorers
and hunters it is a river of rivers the du chesne san rafael yampa
dolores gunnison cochetopa uncompahgre eagle and roaring rivers
the green and the grand and scores of others with branches innumerable
as mad and glad a band as ever sang on mountains descending in glory
of foam and spray from snow-banks and glaciers through their rocky
moraine-dammed beaver-dammed channels then all emerging from dark
balsam and pine woods and coming together they meander through wide
sunny park valleys and at length enter the great plateau and flow in
deep canyons the beginning of the system culminating in this grand
canyon of canyons

our warm canyon camp is also a good place to give a thought to the
glaciers which still exist at the heads of the highest tributaries some
of them are of considerable size especially those on the wind river
and sawatch ranges in wyoming and colorado they are remnants of a vast
system of glaciers which recently covered the upper part of the colorado
basin sculptured its peaks ridges and valleys to their present forms
and extended far out over the plateau region how far i cannot now say
it appears therefore that however old the main trunk of the colorado
may be all its widespread upper branches and the landscapes they flow
through are new-born scarce at all changed as yet in any important
feature since they first came to light at the close of the glacial
period

the so-called grand colorado plateau of which the grand canyon is
only one of the well-proportioned features extends with a breadth of
hundreds of miles from the flanks of the wahsatch and park mountains to
the south of the san francisco peaks immediately to the north of the
deepest part of the canyon it rises in a series of subordinate plateaus
diversified with green meadows marshes bogs ponds forests and grovy
park valleys a favorite indian hunting ground inhabited by elk deer
beaver etc but far the greater part of the plateau is good sound
desert rocky sandy or fluffy with loose ashes and dust dissected in
some places into a labyrinth of stream-channel chasms like cracks in a
dry clay-bed or the narrow slit crevasses of glaciers blackened with
lava flows dotted with volcanoes and beautiful buttes and lined with
long continuous escarpments a vast bed of sediments of an ancient
sea-bottom still nearly as level as when first laid down after being
heaved into the sky a mile or two high

walking quietly about in the alleys and byways of the grand canyon city
we learn something of the way it was made and all must admire effects
so great from means apparently so simple rain striking light hammer
blows or heavier in streams with many rest sundays soft air and light
gentle sappers and miners toiling forever the big river sawing the
plateau asunder carrying away the eroded and ground waste and
exposing the edges of the strata to the weather rain torrents sawing
cross-streets and alleys exposing the strata in the same way in
hundreds of sections the softer less resisting beds weathering and
receding faster thus undermining the harder beds which fall not
only in small weathered particles but in heavy sheer-cleaving masses
assisted down from time to time by kindly earthquakes rain torrents
rushing the fallen material to the river keeping the wall rocks
constantly exposed thus the canyon grows wider and deeper so also do
the side canyons and amphitheaters while secondary gorges and cirques
gradually isolate masses of the promontories forming new buildings
all of which are being weathered and pulled and shaken down while being
built showing destruction and creation as one we see the proudest
temples and palaces in stateliest attitudes wearing their sheets of
detritus as royal robes shedding off showers of red and yellow stones
like trees in autumn shedding their leaves going to dust like beautiful
days to night proclaiming as with the tongues of angels the natural
beauty of death

every building is seen to be a remnant of once continuous beds of
sediments sand and slime on the floor of an ancient sea and filled
with the remains of animals and every particle of the sandstones
and limestones of these wonderful structures to be derived from other
landscapes weathered and rolled and ground in the storms and streams
of other ages and when we examine the escarpments hills buttes and
other monumental masses of the plateau on either side of the canyon we
discover that an amount of material has been carried off in the general
denudation of the region compared with which even that carried away in
the making of the grand canyon is as nothing thus each wonder in sight
becomes a window through which other wonders come to view in no other
part of this continent are the wonders of geology the records of the
world's auld lang syne more widely opened or displayed in higher
piles the whole canyon is a mine of fossils in which five thousand
feet of horizontal strata are exposed in regular succession over more
than a thousand square miles of wall-space and on the adjacent plateau
region there is another series of beds twice as thick forming a grand
geological library a collection of stone books covering thousands of
miles of shelving tier on tier conveniently arranged for the student
and with what wonderful scriptures are their pages filled myriad forms
of successive floras and faunas lavishly illustrated with colored
drawings carrying us back into the midst of the life of a past
infinitely remote and as we go on and on studying this old old life
in the light of the life beating warmly about us we enrich and lengthen
our own﻿chapter i
foreword


it began in the swimming pool at glen ellen  between swims it was our
wont to come out and lie in the sand and let our skins breathe the warm
air and soak in the sunshine  roscoe was a yachtsman  i had followed
the sea a bit  it was inevitable that we should talk about boats  we
talked about small boats and the seaworthiness of small boats  we
instanced captain slocum and his three years voyage around the world in
the spray

we asserted that we were not afraid to go around the world in a small
boat say forty feet long  we asserted furthermore that we would like to
do it  we asserted finally that there was nothing in this world wed
like better than a chance to do it

“let us do it” we said    in fun

then i asked charmian privily if shed really care to do it and she said
that it was too good to be true

the next time we breathed our skins in the sand by the swimming pool i
said to roscoe “let us do it”

i was in earnest and so was he for he said

“when shall we start?”

i had a house to build on the ranch also an orchard a vineyard and
several hedges to plant and a number of other things to do  we thought
we would start in four or five years  then the lure of the adventure
began to grip us  why not start at once?  wed never be younger any of
us  let the orchard vineyard and hedges be growing up while we were
away  when we came back they would be ready for us and we could live
in the barn while we built the house

so the trip was decided upon and the building of the snark began  we
named her the snark because we could not think of any other name—this
information is given for the benefit of those who otherwise might think
there is something occult in the name

our friends cannot understand why we make this voyage  they shudder and
moan and raise their hands  no amount of explanation can make them
comprehend that we are moving along the line of least resistance that it
is easier for us to go down to the sea in a small ship than to remain on
dry land just as it is easier for them to remain on dry land than to go
down to the sea in the small ship  this state of mind comes of an undue
prominence of the ego  they cannot get away from themselves  they
cannot come out of themselves long enough to see that their line of least
resistance is not necessarily everybody elses line of least resistance
they make of their own bundle of desires likes and dislikes a yardstick
wherewith to measure the desires likes and dislikes of all creatures
this is unfair  i tell them so  but they cannot get away from their own
miserable egos long enough to hear me  they think i am crazy  in
return i am sympathetic  it is a state of mind familiar to me  we are
all prone to think there is something wrong with the mental processes of
the man who disagrees with us

the ultimate word is i like  it lies beneath philosophy and is twined
about the heart of life  when philosophy has maundered ponderously for a
month telling the individual what he must do the individual says in an
instant “i like” and does something else and philosophy goes
glimmering  it is i like that makes the drunkard drink and the martyr
wear a hair shirt that makes one man a reveller and another man an
anchorite that makes one man pursue fame another gold another love
and another god  philosophy is very often a mans way of explaining his
own i like

but to return to the snark and why i for one want to journey in her
around the world  the things i like constitute my set of values  the
thing i like most of all is personal achievement—not achievement for the
worlds applause but achievement for my own delight  it is the old “i
did it  i did it  with my own hands i did it”  but personal
achievement with me must be concrete  id rather win a water-fight in
the swimming pool or remain astride a horse that is trying to get out
from under me than write the great american novel  each man to his
liking  some other fellow would prefer writing the great american novel
to winning the water-fight or mastering the horse

possibly the proudest achievement of my life my moment of highest
living occurred when i was seventeen  i was in a three-masted schooner
off the coast of japan  we were in a typhoon  all hands had been on
deck most of the night  i was called from my bunk at seven in the
morning to take the wheel  not a stitch of canvas was set  we were
running before it under bare poles yet the schooner fairly tore along
the seas were all of an eighth of a mile apart and the wind snatched the
whitecaps from their summits filling  the air so thick with driving
spray that it was impossible to see more than two waves at a time  the
schooner was almost unmanageable rolling her rail under to starboard and
to port veering and yawing anywhere between south-east and south-west
and threatening when the huge seas lifted under her quarter to broach
to  had she broached to she would ultimately have been reported lost
with all hands and no tidings

i took the wheel  the sailing-master watched me for a space  he was
afraid of my youth feared that i lacked the strength and the nerve  but
when he saw me successfully wrestle the schooner through several bouts
he went below to breakfast  fore and aft all hands were below at
breakfast  had she broached to not one of them would ever have reached
the deck  for forty minutes i stood there alone at the wheel in my
grasp the wildly careering schooner and the lives of twenty-two men
once we were pooped  i saw it coming and half-drowned with tons of
water crushing me i checked the schooners rush to broach to  at the
end of the hour sweating and played out i was relieved  but i had done
it  with my own hands i had done my trick at the wheel and guided a
hundred tons of wood and iron through a few million tons of wind and
waves

my delight was in that i had done it—not in the fact that twenty-two men
knew i had done it  within the year over half of them were dead and
gone yet my pride in the thing performed was not diminished by half  i
am willing to confess however that i do like a small audience  but it
must be a very small audience composed of those who love me and whom i
love  when i then accomplish personal achievement i have a feeling that
i am justifying their love for me  but this is quite apart from the
delight of the achievement itself  this delight is peculiarly my own and
does not depend upon witnesses  when i have done some such thing i am
exalted  i glow all over  i am aware of a pride in myself that is mine
and mine alone  it is organic  every fibre of me is thrilling with it
it is very natural  it is a mere matter of satisfaction at adjustment to
environment  it is success

life that lives is life successful and success is the breath of its
nostrils  the achievement of a difficult feat is successful adjustment
to a sternly exacting environment  the more difficult the feat the
greater the satisfaction at its accomplishment  thus it is with the man
who leaps forward from the springboard out over the swimming pool and
with a backward half-revolution of the body enters the water head first
once he leaves the springboard his environment becomes immediately
savage and savage the penalty it will exact should he fail and strike
the water flat  of course the man does not have to run the risk of the
penalty  he could remain on the bank in a sweet and placid environment
of summer air sunshine and stability  only he is not made that way
in that swift mid-air moment he lives as he could never live on the bank

as for myself id rather be that man than the fellows who sit on the
bank and watch him  that is why i am building the snark  i am so
made  i like that is all  the trip around the world means big moments
of living  bear with me a moment and look at it  here am i a little
animal called a man—a bit of vitalized matter one hundred and sixty-five
pounds of meat and blood nerve sinew bones and brain—all of it soft
and tender susceptible to hurt fallible and frail  i strike a light
back-handed blow on the nose of an obstreperous horse and a bone in my
hand is broken  i put my head under the water for five minutes and i am
drowned  i fall twenty feet through the air and i am smashed  i am a
creature of temperature  a few degrees one way and my fingers and ears
and toes blacken and drop off  a few degrees the other way and my skin
blisters and shrivels away from the raw quivering flesh  a few
additional degrees either way and the life and the light in me go out
a drop of poison injected into my body from a snake and i cease to
move—for ever i cease to move  a splinter of lead from a rifle enters my
head and i am wrapped around in the eternal blackness

fallible and frail a bit of pulsating jelly-like life—it is all i am
about me are the great natural forces—colossal menaces titans of
destruction unsentimental monsters that have less concern for me than i
have for the grain of sand i crush under my foot  they have no concern
at all for me  they do not know me  they are unconscious unmerciful
and unmoral  they are the cyclones and tornadoes lightning flashes and
cloud-bursts tide-rips and tidal waves undertows and waterspouts great
whirls and sucks and eddies earthquakes and volcanoes surfs that
thunder on rock-ribbed coasts and seas that leap aboard the largest
crafts that float crushing humans to pulp or licking them off into the
sea and to death—and these insensate monsters do not know that tiny
sensitive creature all nerves and weaknesses whom men call jack london
and who himself thinks he is all right and quite a superior being

in the maze and chaos of the conflict of these vast and draughty titans
it is for me to thread my precarious way  the bit of life that is i will
exult over them  the bit of life that is i in so far as it succeeds in
baffling them or in bitting them to its service will imagine that it is
godlike  it is good to ride the tempest and feel godlike  i dare to
assert that for a finite speck of pulsating jelly to feel godlike is a
far more glorious feeling than for a god to feel godlike

here is the sea the wind and the wave  here are the seas the winds
and the waves of all the world  here is ferocious environment  and here
is difficult adjustment the achievement of which is delight to the small
quivering vanity that is i  i like  i am so made  it is my own
particular form of vanity that is all

there is also another side to the voyage of the snark  being alive i
want to see and all the world is a bigger thing to see than one small
town or valley  we have done little outlining of the voyage  only one
thing is definite and that is that our first port of call will be
honolulu  beyond a few general ideas we have no thought of our next
port after hawaii  we shall make up our minds as we get nearer in a
general way we know that we shall wander through the south seas take in
samoa new zealand tasmania australia new guinea borneo and sumatra
and go on up through the philippines to japan  then will come korea
china india the red sea and the mediterranean  after that the voyage
becomes too vague to describe though we know a number of things we shall
surely do and we expect to spend from one to several months in every
country in europe

the snark is to be sailed  there will be a gasolene engine on board
but it will be used only in case of emergency such as in bad water among
reefs and shoals where a sudden calm in a swift current leaves a
sailing-boat helpless  the rig of the snark is to be what is called
the “ketch”  the ketch rig is a compromise between the yawl and the
schooner  of late years the yawl rig has proved the best for cruising
the ketch retains the cruising virtues of the yawl and in addition
manages to embrace a few of the sailing virtues of the schooner  the
foregoing must be taken with a pinch of salt  it is all theory in my
head  ive never sailed a ketch nor even seen one  the theory commends
itself to me  wait till i get out on the ocean then ill be able to
tell more about the cruising and sailing qualities of the ketch

as originally planned the snark was to be forty feet long on the
water-line  but we discovered there was no space for a bath-room and
for that reason we have increased her length to forty-five feet  her
greatest beam is fifteen feet  she has no house and no hold  there is
six feet of headroom and the deck is unbroken save for two companionways
and a hatch forard  the fact that there is no house to break the
strength of the deck will make us feel safer in case great seas thunder
their tons of water down on board  a large and roomy cockpit sunk
beneath the deck with high rail and self-bailing will make our
rough-weather days and nights more comfortable

there will be no crew  or rather charmian roscoe and i are the crew
we are going to do the thing with our own hands  with our own hands
were going to circumnavigate the globe  sail her or sink her with our
own hands well do it  of course there will be a cook and a cabin-boy
why should we stew over a stove wash dishes and set the table?  we
could stay on land if we wanted to do those things  besides weve got
to stand watch and work the ship  and also ive got to work at my trade
of writing in order to feed us and to get new sails and tackle and keep
the snark in efficient working order  and then theres the ranch ive
got to keep the vineyard orchard and hedges growing

when we increased the length of the snark in order to get space for a
bath-room we found that all the space was not required by the bath-room
because of this we increased the size of the engine  seventy
horse-power our engine is and since we expect it to drive us along at a
nine-knot clip we do not know the name of a river with a current swift
enough to defy us

we expect to do a lot of inland work  the smallness of the snark makes
this possible  when we enter the land out go the masts and on goes the
engine  there are the canals of china and the yang-tse river  we shall
spend months on them if we can get permission from the government  that
will be the one obstacle to our inland voyaging—governmental permission
but if we can get that permission there is scarcely a limit to the
inland voyaging we can do

when we come to the nile why we can go up the nile  we can go up the
danube to vienna up the thames to london and we can go up the seine to
paris and moor opposite the latin quarter with a bow-line out to notre
dame and a stern-line fast to the morgue  we can leave the mediterranean
and go up the rhône to lyons there enter the saône cross from the saône
to the maine through the canal de bourgogne and from the marne enter the
seine and go out the seine at havre  when we cross the atlantic to the
united states we can go up the hudson pass through the erie canal
cross the great lakes leave lake michigan at chicago gain the
mississippi by way of the illinois river and the connecting canal and go
down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico  and then there are the great
rivers of south america  well know something about geography when we
get back to california

people that build houses are often sore perplexed but if they enjoy the
strain of it ill advise them to build a boat like the snark  just
consider for a moment the strain of detail  take the engine  what is
the best kind of engine—the two cycle? three cycle? four cycle?  my lips
are mutilated with all kinds of strange jargon my mind is mutilated with
still stranger ideas and is foot-sore and weary from travelling in new
and rocky realms of thought—ignition methods shall it be make-and-break
or jump-spark?  shall dry cells or storage batteries be used?  a storage
battery commends itself but it requires a dynamo  how powerful a
dynamo?  and when we have installed a dynamo and a storage battery it is
simply ridiculous not to light the boat with electricity  then comes the
discussion of how many lights and how many candle-power  it is a
splendid idea  but electric lights will demand a more powerful storage
battery which in turn demands a more powerful dynamo

and now that weve gone in for it why not have a searchlight?  it would
be tremendously useful  but the searchlight needs so much electricity
that when it runs it will put all the other lights out of commission
again we travel the weary road in the quest after more power for storage
battery and dynamo  and then when it is finally solved some one asks
“what if the engine breaks down?”  and we collapse  there are the
sidelights the binnacle light and the anchor light  our very lives
depend upon them  so we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps
as well

but we are not done with that engine yet  the engine is powerful  we
are two small men and a small woman  it will break our hearts and our
backs to hoist anchor by hand  let the engine do it  and then comes the
problem of how to convey power forard from the engine to the winch  and
by the time all this is settled we redistribute the allotments of space
to the engine-room galley bath-room state-rooms and cabin and begin
all over again  and when we have shifted the engine i send off a
telegram of gibberish to its makers at new york something like this
toggle-joint abandoned change thrust-bearing accordingly distance from
forward side of flywheel to face of stern post sixteen feet six inches

just potter around in quest of the best steering gear or try to decide
whether you will set up your rigging with old-fashioned lanyards or with
turnbuckles if you want strain of detail  shall the binnacle be located
in front of the wheel in the centre of the beam or shall it be located
to one side in front of the wheel?—theres room right there for a library
of sea-dog controversy  then theres the problem of gasolene fifteen
hundred gallons of it—what are the safest ways to tank it and pipe it?
and which is the best fire-extinguisher for a gasolene fire?  then there
is the pretty problem of the life-boat and the stowage of the same  and
when that is finished come the cook and cabin-boy to confront one with
nightmare possibilities  it is a small boat and well be packed close
together  the servant-girl problem of landsmen pales to insignificance
we did select one cabin-boy and by that much were our troubles eased
and then the cabin-boy fell in love and resigned

and in the meanwhile how is a fellow to find time to study
navigation—when he is divided between these problems and the earning of
the money wherewith to settle the problems?  neither roscoe nor i know
anything about navigation and the summer is gone and we are about to
start and the problems are thicker than ever and the treasury is
stuffed with emptiness  well anyway it takes years to learn
seamanship and both of us are seamen  if we dont find the time well
lay in the books and instruments and teach ourselves navigation on the
ocean between san francisco and hawaii

there is one unfortunate and perplexing phase of the voyage of the
snark  roscoe who is to be my co-navigator is a follower of one
cyrus r teed  now cyrus r teed has a different cosmology from the one
generally accepted and roscoe shares his views  wherefore roscoe
believes that the surface of the earth is concave and that we live on the
inside of a hollow sphere  thus though we shall sail on the one boat
the snark roscoe will journey around the world on the inside while i
shall journey around on the outside  but of this more anon  we
threaten to be of the one mind before the voyage is completed  i am
confident that i shall convert him into making the journey on the
outside while he is equally confident that before we arrive back in san
francisco i shall be on the inside of the earth  how he is going to get
me through the crust i dont know but roscoe is ay a masterful man

                                * * * * *

ps—that engine  while weve got it and the dynamo and the storage
battery why not have an ice-machine?  ice in the tropics  it is more
necessary than bread  here goes for the ice-machine  now i am plunged
into chemistry and my lips hurt and my mind hurts and how am i ever to
find the time to study navigation?




chapter ii
the inconceivable and monstrous


“spare no money” i said to roscoe  “let everything on the snark be of
the best  and never mind decoration  plain pine boards is good enough
finishing for me  but put the money into the construction  let the
snark be as staunch and strong as any boat afloat  never mind what it
costs to make her staunch and strong you see that she is made staunch
and strong and ill go on writing and earning the money to pay for it”

and i did    as well as i could for the snark ate up money faster
than i could earn it  in fact every little while i had to borrow money
with which to supplement my earnings  now i borrowed one thousand
dollars now i borrowed two thousand dollars and now i borrowed five
thousand dollars  and all the time i went on working every day and
sinking the earnings in the venture  i worked sundays as well and i
took no holidays  but it was worth it  every time i thought of the
snark i knew she was worth it

for know gentle reader the staunchness of the snark  she is
forty-five feet long on the waterline  her garboard strake is three
inches thick her planking two and one-half inches thick her
deck-planking two inches thick and in all her planking there are no
butts  i know for i ordered that planking especially from puget sound
then the snark has four water-tight compartments which is to say that
her length is broken by three water-tight bulkheads  thus no matter how
large a leak the snark may spring only one compartment can fill with
water  the other three compartments will keep her afloat anyway and
besides will enable us to mend the leak  there is another virtue in
these bulkheads  the last compartment of all in the very stern
contains six tanks that carry over one thousand gallons of gasolene  now
gasolene is a very dangerous article to carry in bulk on a small craft
far out on the wide ocean  but when the six tanks that do not leak are
themselves contained in a compartment hermetically sealed off from the
rest of the boat the danger will be seen to be very small indeed

the snark is a sail-boat  she was built primarily to sail  but
incidentally as an auxiliary a seventy-horse-power engine was
installed  this is a good strong engine  i ought to know  i paid for
it to come out all the way from new york city  then on deck above the
engine is a windlass  it is a magnificent affair  it weighs several
hundred pounds and takes up no end of deck-room  you see it is
ridiculous to hoist up anchor by hand-power when there is a
seventy-horse-power engine on board  so we installed the windlass
transmitting power to it from the engine by means of a gear and castings
specially made in a san francisco foundry

the snark was made for comfort and no expense was spared in this
regard  there is the bath-room for instance small and compact it is
true but containing all the conveniences of any bath-room upon land
the bath-room is a beautiful dream of schemes and devices pumps and
levers and sea-valves  why in the course of its building i used to
lie awake nights thinking about that bath-room  and next to the
bath-room come the life-boat and the launch  they are carried on deck
and they take up what little space might have been left us for exercise
but then they beat life insurance and the prudent man even if he has
built as staunch and strong a craft as the snark will see to it that
he has a good life-boat as well  and ours is a good one  it is a dandy
it was stipulated to cost one hundred and fifty dollars and when i came
to pay the bill it turned out to be three hundred and ninety-five
dollars  that shows how good a life-boat it is

i could go on at great length relating the various virtues and
excellences of the snark but i refrain  i have bragged enough as it
is and i have bragged to a purpose as will be seen before my tale is
ended  and please remember its title “the inconceivable and monstrous”
it was planned that the snark should sail on october 1 1906  that she
did not so sail was inconceivable and monstrous  there was no valid
reason for not sailing except that she was not ready to sail and there
was no conceivable reason why she was not ready  she was promised on
november first on november fifteenth on december first and yet she was
never ready  on december first charmian and i left the sweet clean
sonoma country and came down to live in the stifling city—but not for
long oh no only for two weeks for we would sail on december
fifteenth  and i guess we ought to know for roscoe said so and it was
on his advice that we came to the city to stay two weeks  alas the two
weeks went by four weeks went by six weeks went by eight weeks went
by and we were farther away from sailing than ever  explain it?
who?—me?  i cant  it is the one thing in all my life that i have backed
down on  there is no explaining it if there were id do it  i who am
an artisan of speech confess my inability to explain why the snark was
not ready  as i have said and as i must repeat it was inconceivable
and monstrous

the eight weeks became sixteen weeks and then one day roscoe cheered
us up by saying “if we dont sail before april first you can use my
head for a football”

two weeks later he said “im getting my head in training for that
match”

“never mind” charmian and i said to each other “think of the wonderful
boat it is going to be when it is completed”

whereat we would rehearse for our mutual encouragement the manifold
virtues and excellences of the snark  also i would borrow more money
and i would get down closer to my desk and write harder and i refused
heroically to take a sunday off and go out into the hills with my
friends  i was building a boat and by the eternal it was going to be a
boat and a boat spelled out all in capitals—b—o—a—t and no matter what
it cost i didnt care  so long as it was a b o a t

and oh there is one other excellence of the snark upon which i must
brag namely her bow  no sea could ever come over it  it laughs at the
sea that bow does it challenges the sea it snorts defiance at the sea
and withal it is a beautiful bow the lines of it are dreamlike i doubt
if ever a boat was blessed with a more beautiful and at the same time a
more capable bow  it was made to punch storms  to touch that bow is to
rest ones hand on the cosmic nose of things  to look at it is to
realize that expense cut no figure where it was concerned  and every
time our sailing was delayed or a new expense was tacked on we thought
of that wonderful bow and were content

the snark is a small boat  when i figured seven thousand dollars as
her generous cost i was both generous and correct  i have built barns
and houses and i know the peculiar trait such things have of running
past their estimated cost  this knowledge was mine was already mine
when i estimated the probable cost of the building of the snark at
seven thousand dollars  well she cost thirty thousand  now dont ask
me please  it is the truth  i signed the cheques and i raised the
money  of course there is no explaining it inconceivable and monstrous
is what it is as you will agree i know ere my tale is done

then there was the matter of delay  i dealt with forty-seven different
kinds of union men and with one hundred and fifteen different firms  and
not one union man and not one firm of all the union men and all the firms
ever delivered anything at the time agreed upon nor ever was on time for
anything except pay-day and bill-collection  men pledged me their
immortal souls that they would deliver a certain thing on a certain date
as a rule after such pledging they rarely exceeded being three months
late in delivery  and so it went and charmian and i consoled each other
by saying what a splendid boat the snark was so staunch and strong
also we would get into the small boat and row around the snark and
gloat over her unbelievably wonderful bow

“think” i would say to charmian “of a gale off the china coast and of
the snark hove to that splendid bow of hers driving into the storm
not a drop will come over that bow  shell be as dry as a feather and
well be all below playing whist while the gale howls”

and charmian would press my hand enthusiastically and exclaim “its
worth every bit of it—the delay and expense and worry and all the
rest  oh what a truly wonderful boat”

whenever i looked at the bow of the snark or thought of her water-tight
compartments i was encouraged  nobody else however was encouraged
my friends began to make bets against the various sailing dates of the
snark  mr wiget who was left behind in charge of our sonoma ranch
was the first to cash his bet  he collected on new years day 1907
after that the bets came fast and furious  my friends surrounded me like
a gang of harpies making bets against every sailing date i set  i was
rash and i was stubborn  i bet and i bet and i continued to bet and
i paid them all  why the women-kind of my friends grew so brave that
those among them who never bet before began to bet with me  and i paid
them too

“never mind” said charmian to me “just think of that bow and of being
hove to on the china seas”

“you see” i said to my friends when i paid the latest bunch of wagers
“neither trouble nor cash is being spared in making the snark the most
seaworthy craft that ever sailed out through the golden gate—that is what
causes all the delay”

in the meantime editors and publishers with whom i had contracts pestered
me with demands for explanations  but how could i explain to them when
i was unable to explain to myself or when there was nobody not even
roscoe to explain to me?  the newspapers began to laugh at me and to
publish rhymes anent the snarks departure with refrains like “not
yet but soon”  and charmian cheered me up by reminding me of the bow
and i went to a banker and borrowed five thousand more  there was one
recompense for the delay however  a friend of mine who happens to be a
critic wrote a roast of me of all i had done and of all i ever was
going to do and he planned to have it published after i was out on the
ocean  i was still on shore when it came out and he has been busy
explaining ever since

and the time continued to go by  one thing was becoming apparent
namely that it was impossible to finish the snark in san francisco
she had been so long in the building that she was beginning to break down
and wear out  in fact she had reached the stage where she was breaking
down faster than she could be repaired  she had become a joke  nobody
took her seriously least of all the men who worked on her  i said we
would sail just as she was and finish building her in honolulu  promptly
she sprang a leak that had to be attended to before we could sail  i
started her for the boat-ways  before she got to them she was caught
between two huge barges and received a vigorous crushing  we got her on
the ways and part way along the ways spread and dropped her through
stern-first into the mud

it was a pretty tangle a job for wreckers not boat-builders  there are
two high tides every twenty-four hours and at every high tide night and
day for a week there were two steam tugs pulling and hauling on the
snark  there she was stuck fallen between the ways and standing on
her stern  next and while still in that predicament we started to use
the gears and castings made in the local foundry whereby power was
conveyed from the engine to the windlass  it was the first time we ever
tried to use that windlass  the castings had flaws they shattered
asunder the gears ground together and the windlass was out of
commission  following upon that the seventy-horse-power engine went out
of commission  this engine came from new york so did its bed-plate
there was a flaw in the bed-plate there were a lot of flaws in the
bed-plate and the seventy-horse-power engine broke away from its
shattered foundations reared up in the air smashed all connections and
fastenings and fell over on its side  and the snark continued to
stick between the spread ways and the two tugs continued to haul vainly
upon her

“never mind” said charmian “think of what a staunch strong boat she
is”

“yes” said i “and of that beautiful bow”

so we took heart and went at it again  the ruined engine was lashed down
on its rotten foundation the smashed castings and cogs of the power
transmission were taken down and stored away—all for the purpose of
taking them to honolulu where repairs and new castings could be made
somewhere in the dim past the snark had received on the outside one
coat of white paint  the intention of the colour was still evident
however when one got it in the right light  the snark had never
received any paint on the inside  on the contrary she was coated inches
thick with the grease and tobacco-juice of the multitudinous mechanics
who had toiled upon her  never mind we said the grease and filth could
be planed off and later when we fetched honolulu the snark could be
painted at the same time as she was being rebuilt

by main strength and sweat we dragged the snark off from the wrecked
ways and laid her alongside the oakland city wharf  the drays brought
all the outfit from home the books and blankets and personal luggage
along with this everything else came on board in a torrent of
confusion—wood and coal water and water-tanks vegetables provisions
oil the life-boat and the launch all our friends all the friends of
our friends and those who claimed to be their friends to say nothing of
some of the friends of the friends of the friends of our crew  also
there were reporters and photographers and strangers and cranks and
finally and over all clouds of coal-dust from the wharf

we were to sail sunday at eleven and saturday afternoon had arrived
the crowd on the wharf and the coal-dust were thicker than ever  in one
pocket i carried a cheque-book a fountain-pen a dater and a blotter
in another pocket i carried between one and two thousand dollars in paper
money and gold  i was ready for the creditors cash for the small ones
and cheques for the large ones and was waiting only for roscoe to arrive
with the balances of the accounts of the hundred and fifteen firms who
had delayed me so many months  and then—

and then the inconceivable and monstrous happened once more  before
roscoe could arrive there arrived another man  he was a united states
marshal  he tacked a notice on the snarks brave mast so that all on
the wharf could read that the snark had been libelled for debt  the
marshal left a little old man in charge of the snark and himself went
away  i had no longer any control of the snark nor of her wonderful
bow  the little old man was now her lord and master and i learned that
i was paying him three dollars a day for being lord and master  also i
learned the name of the man who had libelled the snark  it was
sellers the debt was two hundred and thirty-two dollars and the deed
was no more than was to be expected from the possessor of such a name
sellers  ye gods  sellers

but who under the sun was sellers?  i looked in my cheque-book and saw
that two weeks before i had made him out a cheque for five hundred
dollars  other cheque-books showed me that during the many months of the
building of the snark i had paid him several thousand dollars  then
why in the name of common decency hadnt he tried to collect his
miserable little balance instead of libelling the snark?  i thrust my
hands into my pockets and in one pocket encountered the cheque-hook and
the dater and the pen and in the other pocket the gold money and the
paper money  there was the wherewithal to settle his pitiful account a
few score of times and over—why hadnt he given me a chance?  there was
no explanation it was merely the inconceivable and monstrous

to make the matter worse the snark had been libelled late saturday
afternoon and though i sent lawyers and agents all over oakland and san
francisco neither united states judge nor united states marshal nor
mr sellers nor mr sellers attorney nor anybody could be found  they
were all out of town for the weekend  and so the snark did not sail
sunday morning at eleven  the little old man was still in charge and he
said no  and charmian and i walked out on an opposite wharf and took
consolation in the snarks wonderful bow and thought of all the gales
and typhoons it would proudly punch

“a bourgeois trick” i said to charmian speaking of mr sellers and his
libel “a petty traders panic  but never mind our troubles will cease
when once we are away from this and out on the wide ocean”

and in the end we sailed away on tuesday morning april 23 1907  we
started rather lame i confess  we had to hoist anchor by hand because
the power transmission was a wreck  also what remained of our
seventy-horse-power engine was lashed down for ballast on the bottom of
the snark  but what of such things?  they could be fixed in honolulu
and in the meantime think of the magnificent rest of the boat  it is
true the engine in the launch wouldnt run and the life-boat leaked
like a sieve but then they werent the snark they were mere
appurtenances  the things that counted were the water-tight bulkheads
the solid planking without butts the bath-room devices—they were the
snark  and then there was greatest of all that noble wind-punching
bow

we sailed out through the golden gate and set our course south toward
that part of the pacific where we could hope to pick up with the
north-east trades  and right away things began to happen  i had
calculated that youth was the stuff for a voyage like that of the
snark and i had taken three youths—the engineer the cook and the
cabin-boy  my calculation was only two-thirds off i had forgotten to
calculate on seasick youth and i had two of them the cook and the cabin
boy  they immediately took to their bunks and that was the end of their
usefulness for a week to come  it will be understood from the
foregoing that we did not have the hot meals we might have had nor were
things kept clean and orderly down below  but it did not matter very
much anyway for we quickly discovered that our box of oranges had at
some time been frozen that our box of apples was mushy and spoiling
that the crate of cabbages spoiled before it was ever delivered to us
had to go overboard instanter that kerosene had been spilled on the
carrots and that the turnips were woody and the beets rotten while the
kindling was dead wood that wouldnt burn and the coal delivered in
rotten potato-sacks had spilled all over the deck and was washing
through the scuppers

but what did it matter?  such things were mere accessories  there was
the boat—she was all right wasnt she?  i strolled along the deck and in
one minute counted fourteen butts in the beautiful planking ordered
specially from puget sound in order that there should be no butts in it
also that deck leaked and it leaked badly  it drowned roscoe out of
his bunk and ruined the tools in the engine-room to say nothing of the
provisions it ruined in the galley  also the sides of the snark
leaked and the bottom leaked and we had to pump her every day to keep
her afloat  the floor of the galley is a couple of feet above the inside
bottom of the snark and yet i have stood on the floor of the galley
trying to snatch a cold bite and been wet to the knees by the water
churning around inside four hours after the last pumping

then those magnificent water-tight compartments that cost so much time
and money—well they werent water-tight after all  the water moved free
as the air from one compartment to another furthermore a strong smell
of gasolene from the after compartment leads me to suspect that some one
or more of the half-dozen tanks there stored have sprung a leak  the
tanks leak and they are not hermetically sealed in their compartment
then there was the bath-room with its pumps and levers and sea-valves—it
went out of commission inside the first twenty hours  powerful iron
levers broke off short in ones hand when one tried to pump with them
the bath-room was the swiftest wreck of any portion of the snark

and the iron-work on the snark no matter what its source proved to be
mush  for instance the bed-plate of the engine came from new york and
it was mush so were the casting and gears for the windlass that came
from san francisco  and finally there was the wrought iron used in the
rigging that carried away in all directions when the first strains were
put upon it  wrought iron mind you and it snapped like macaroni

a gooseneck on the gaff of the mainsail broke short off  we replaced it
with the gooseneck from the gaff of the storm trysail and the second
gooseneck broke short off inside fifteen minutes of use and mind you
it had been taken from the gaff of the storm trysail upon which we would
have depended in time of storm  at the present moment the snark trails
her mainsail like a broken wing the gooseneck being replaced by a rough
lashing  well see if we can get honest iron in honolulu

man had betrayed us and sent us to sea in a sieve but the lord must have
loved us for we had calm weather in which to learn that we must pump
every day in order to keep afloat and that more trust could be placed in
a wooden toothpick than in the most massive piece of iron to be found
aboard  as the staunchness and the strength of the snark went
glimmering charmian and i pinned our faith more and more to the
snarks wonderful bow  there was nothing else left to pin to  it was
all inconceivable and monstrous we knew but that bow at least was
rational  and then one evening we started to heave to

how shall i describe it?  first of all for the benefit of the tyro let
me explain that heaving to is that sea manœuvre which by means of short
and balanced canvas compels a vessel to ride bow-on to wind and sea
when the wind is too strong or the sea is too high a vessel of the size
of the snark can heave to with ease whereupon there is no more work to
do on deck  nobody needs to steer  the lookout is superfluous  all
hands can go below and sleep or play whist

well it was blowing half of a small summer gale when i told roscoe wed
heave to  night was coming on  i had been steering nearly all day and
all hands on deck (roscoe and bert and charmian) were tired while all
hands below were seasick  it happened that we had already put two reefs
in the big mainsail  the flying-jib and the jib were taken in and a
reef put in the fore-staysail  the mizzen was also taken in  about this
time the flying jib-boom buried itself in a sea and broke short off  i
started to put the wheel down in order to heave to  the snark at the
moment was rolling in the trough  she continued rolling in the trough
i put the spokes down harder and harder  she never budged from the
trough  (the trough gentle reader is the most dangerous position all
in which to lay a vessel)  i put the wheel hard down and still the
snark rolled in the trough  eight points was the nearest i could get
her to the wind  i had roscoe and bert come in on the main-sheet  the
snark rolled on in the trough now putting her rail under on one side
and now under on the other side

again the inconceivable and monstrous was showing its grizzly head  it
was grotesque impossible  i refused to believe it  under double-reefed
mainsail and single-reefed staysail the snark refused to heave to  we
flattened the mainsail down  it did not alter the snarks course a
tenth of a degree  we slacked the mainsail off with no more result  we
set a storm trysail on the mizzen and took in the mainsail  no change
the snark roiled on in the trough  that beautiful bow of hers refused
to come up and face the wind

next we took in the reefed staysail  thus the only bit of canvas left
on her was the storm trysail on the mizzen  if anything would bring her
bow up to the wind that would  maybe you wont believe me when i say it
failed but i do say it failed  and i say it failed because i saw it
fail and not because i believe it failed  i dont believe it did fail
it is unbelievable and i am not telling you what i believe i am telling
you what i saw

now gentle reader what would you do if you were on a small boat
rolling in the trough of the sea a trysail on that small boats stern
that was unable to swing the bow up into the wind?  get out the
sea-anchor  its just what we did  we had a patent one made to order
and warranted not to dive  imagine a hoop of steel that serves to keep
open the mouth of a large conical canvas bag and you have a
sea-anchor  well we made a line fast to the sea-anchor and to the bow
of the snark and then dropped the sea-anchor overboard  it promptly
dived  we had a tripping line on it so we tripped the sea-anchor and
hauled it in  we attached a big timber as a float and dropped the
sea-anchor over again  this time it floated  the line to the bow grew
taut  the trysail on the mizzen tended to swing the bow into the wind
but in spite of this tendency the snark calmly took that sea-anchor
in her teeth and went on ahead dragging it after her still in the
trough of the sea  and there you are  we even took in the trysail
hoisted the full mizzen in its place and hauled the full mizzen down
flat and the snark wallowed in the trough and dragged the sea-anchor
behind her  dont believe me  i dont believe it myself  i am merely
telling you what i saw

now i leave it to you  who ever heard of a sailing-boat that wouldnt
heave to?—that wouldnt heave to with a sea-anchor to help it?  out of my
brief experience with boats i know i never did  and i stood on deck and
looked on the naked face of the inconceivable and monstrous—the snark
that wouldnt heave to  a stormy night with broken moonlight had come
on  there was a splash of wet in the air and up to windward there was a
promise of rain-squalls and then there was the trough of the sea cold
and cruel in the moonlight in which the snark complacently rolled
and then we took in the sea-anchor and the mizzen hoisted the reefed
staysail ran the snark off before it and went below—not to the hot
meal that should have awaited us but to skate across the slush and slime
on the cabin floor where cook and cabin-boy lay like dead men in their
bunks and to lie down in our own bunks with our clothes on ready for a
call and to listen to the bilge-water spouting knee-high on the galley
floor

in the bohemian club of san francisco there are some crack sailors  i
know because i heard them pass judgment on the snark during the
process of her building  they found only one vital thing the matter with
her and on this they were all agreed namely that she could not run
she was all right in every particular they said except that id never
be able to run her before it in a stiff wind and sea  “her lines” they
explained enigmatically “it is the fault of her lines  she simply
cannot be made to run that is all”  well i wish id only had those
crack sailors of the bohemian club on board the snark the other night
for them to see for themselves their one vital unanimous judgment
absolutely reversed  run?  it is the one thing the snark does to
perfection  run?  she ran with a sea-anchor fast forard and a full
mizzen flattened down aft  run?  at the present moment as i write this
we are bowling along before it at a six-knot clip in the north-east
trades  quite a tidy bit of sea is running  there is nobody at the
wheel the wheel is not even lashed and is set over a half-spoke weather
helm  to be precise the wind is north-east the snarks mizzen is
furled her mainsail is over to starboard her head-sheets are hauled
flat and the snarks course is south-south-west  and yet there are
men who have sailed the seas for forty years and who hold that no boat
can run before it without being steered  theyll call me a liar when
they read this its what they called captain slocum when he said the
same of his spray

as regards the future of the snark im all at sea  i dont know  if i
had the money or the credit id build another snark that would heave
to  but i am at the end of my resources  ive got to put up with the
present snark or quit—and i cant quit  so i guess ill have to try to
get along with heaving the snark to stern first  i am waiting for the
next gale to see how it will work  i think it can be done  it all
depends on how her stern takes the seas  and who knows but that some
wild morning on the china sea some gray-beard skipper will stare rub
his incredulous eyes and stare again at the spectacle of a weird small
craft very much like the snark hove to stern-first and riding out the
gale?

ps  on my return to california after the voyage i learned that the
snark was forty-three feet on the water-line instead of forty-five
this was due to the fact that the builder was not on speaking terms with
the tape-line or two-foot rule




chapter iii
adventure


no adventure is not dead and in spite of the steam engine and of thomas
cook & son  when the announcement of the contemplated voyage of the
snark was made young men of “roving disposition” proved to be legion
and young women as well—to say nothing of the elderly men and women who
volunteered for the voyage  why among my personal friends there were at
least half a dozen who regretted their recent or imminent marriages and
there was one marriage i know of that almost failed to come off because
of the snark

                                * * * * *

every mail to me was burdened with the letters of applicants who were
suffocating in the “man-stifled towns” and it soon dawned upon me that a
twentieth century ulysses required a corps of stenographers to clear his
correspondence before setting sail  no adventure is certainly not
dead—not while one receives letters that begin

“there is no doubt that when you read this soul-plea from a female
stranger in new york city” etc and wherein one learns a little
farther on that this female stranger weighs only ninety pounds wants to
be cabin-boy and “yearns to see the countries of the world”

the possession of a “passionate fondness for geography” was the way one
applicant expressed the wander-lust that was in him while another wrote
“i am cursed with an eternal yearning to be always on the move
consequently this letter to you”  but best of all was the fellow who
said he wanted to come because his feet itched

there were a few who wrote anonymously suggesting names of friends and
giving said friends qualifications but to me there was a hint of
something sinister in such proceedings and i went no further in the
matter

with two or three exceptions all the hundreds that volunteered for my
crew were very much in earnest  many of them sent their photographs
ninety per cent offered to work in any capacity and ninety-nine per
cent offered to work without salary  “contemplating your voyage on the
snark” said one “and notwithstanding its attendant dangers to
accompany you (in any capacity whatever) would be the climax of my
ambitions”  which reminds me of the young fellow who was “seventeen
years old and ambicious” and who at the end of his letter earnestly
requested “but please do not let this git into the papers or magazines”
quite different was the one who said “i would be willing to work like
hell and not demand pay”  almost all of them wanted me to telegraph at
their expense my acceptance of their services and quite a number
offered to put up a bond to guarantee their appearance on sailing date

some were rather vague in their own minds concerning the work to be done
on the snark as for instance the one who wrote “i am taking the
liberty of writing you this note to find out if there would be any
possibility of my going with you as one of the crew of your boat to make
sketches and illustrations”  several unaware of the needful work on a
small craft like the snark offered to serve as one of them phrased
it “as assistant in filing materials collected for books and novels”
thats what one gets for being prolific

“let me give my qualifications for the job” wrote one  “i am an orphan
living with my uncle who is a hot revolutionary socialist and who says a
man without the red blood of adventure is an animated dish-rag”  said
another “i can swim some though i dont know any of the new strokes
but what is more important than strokes the water is a friend of mine”
“if i was put alone in a sail-boat i could get her anywhere i wanted to
go” was the qualification of a third—and a better qualification than the
one that follows “i have also watched the fish-boats unload”  but
possibly the prize should go to this one who very subtly conveys his
deep knowledge of the world and life by saying “my age in years is
twenty-two”

then there were the simple straight-out homely and unadorned letters of
young boys lacking in the felicities of expression it is true but
desiring greatly to make the voyage  these were the hardest of all to
decline and each time i declined one it seemed as if i had struck youth
a slap in the face  they were so earnest these boys they wanted so
much to go  “i am sixteen but large for my age” said one and another
“seventeen but large and healthy”  “i am as strong at least as the
average boy of my size” said an evident weakling  “not afraid of any
kind of work” was what many said while one in particular to lure me no
doubt by inexpensiveness wrote “i can pay my way to the pacific coast
so that part would probably be acceptable to you”  “going around the
world is the one thing i want to do” said one and it seemed to be the
one thing that a few hundred wanted to do  “i have no one who cares
whether i go or not” was the pathetic note sounded by another  one had
sent his photograph and speaking of it said “im a homely-looking sort
of a chap but looks dont always count”  and i am confident that the
lad who wrote the following would have turned out all right “my age is
19 years but i am rather small and consequently wont take up much room
but im tough as the devil”  and there was one thirteen-year-old
applicant that charmian and i fell in love with and it nearly broke our
hearts to refuse him

but it must not be imagined that most of my volunteers were boys on the
contrary boys constituted a very small proportion  there were men and
women from every walk in life  physicians surgeons and dentists
offered in large numbers to come along and like all the professional
men offered to come without pay to serve in any capacity and to pay
even for the privilege of so serving

there was no end of compositors and reporters who wanted to come to say
nothing of experienced valets chefs and stewards  civil engineers were
keen on the voyage “lady” companions galore cropped up for charmian
while i was deluged with the applications of would-be private
secretaries  many high school and university students yearned for the
voyage and every trade in the working class developed a few applicants
the machinists electricians and engineers being especially strong on
the trip  i was surprised at the number who in musty law offices
heard the call of adventure and i was more than surprised by the number
of elderly and retired sea captains who were still thralls to the sea
several young fellows with millions coming to them later on were wild
for the adventure as were also several county superintendents of
schools

fathers and sons wanted to come and many men with their wives to say
nothing of the young woman stenographer who wrote “write immediately if
you need me  i shall bring my typewriter on the first train”  but the
best of all is the following—observe the delicate way in which he worked
in his wife “i thought i would drop you a line of inquiry as to the
possibility of making the trip with you am 24 years of age married and
broke and a trip of that kind would be just what we are looking for”

come to think of it for the average man it must be fairly difficult to
write an honest letter of self-recommendation  one of my correspondents
was so stumped that he began his letter with the words “this is a hard
task” and after vainly trying to describe his good points he wound up
with “it is a hard job writing about ones self”  nevertheless there
was one who gave himself a most glowing and lengthy character and in
conclusion stated that he had greatly enjoyed writing it

“but suppose this your cabin-boy could run your engine could repair it
when out of order  suppose he could take his turn at the wheel could do
any carpenter or machinist work  suppose he is strong healthy and
willing to work  would you not rather have him than a kid that gets
seasick and cant do anything but wash dishes?”  it was letters of this
sort that i hated to decline  the writer of it self-taught in english
had been only two years in the united states and as he said “i am not
wishing to go with you to earn my living but i wish to learn and see”
at the time of writing to me he was a designer for one of the big motor
manufacturing companies he had been to sea quite a bit and had been
used all his life to the handling of small boats

“i have a good position but it matters not so with me as i prefer
travelling” wrote another  “as to salary look at me and if i am worth
a dollar or two all right and if i am not nothing said  as to my
honesty and character i shall be pleased to show you my employers
never drink no tobacco but to be honest i myself after a little more
experience want to do a little writing”

“i can assure you that i am eminently respectable but find other
respectable people tiresome”  the man who wrote the foregoing certainly
had me guessing and i am still wondering whether or not hed have found
me tiresome or what the deuce he did mean

“i have seen better days than what i am passing through to-day” wrote an
old salt “but i have seen them a great deal worse also”

but the willingness to sacrifice on the part of the man who wrote the
following was so touching that i could not accept “i have a father a
mother brothers and sisters dear friends and a lucrative position and
yet i will sacrifice all to become one of your crew”

another volunteer i could never have accepted was the finicky young
fellow who to show me how necessary it was that i should give him a
chance pointed out that “to go in the ordinary boat be it schooner or
steamer would be impracticable for i would have to mix among and live
with the ordinary type of seamen which as a rule is not a clean sort of
life”

then there was the young fellow of twenty-six who had “run through the
gamut of human emotions” and had “done everything from cooking to
attending stanford university” and who at the present writing was “a
vaquero on a fifty-five-thousand-acre range”  quite in contrast was the
modesty of the one who said “i am not aware of possessing any particular
qualities that would be likely to recommend me to your consideration
but should you be impressed you might consider it worth a few minutes
time to answer  otherwise theres always work at the trade  not
expecting but hoping i remain etc”

but i have held my head in both my hands ever since trying to figure out
the intellectual kinship between myself and the one who wrote “long
before i knew of you i had mixed political economy and history and
deducted therefrom many of your conclusions in concrete”

here in its way is one of the best as it is the briefest that i
received “if any of the present company signed on for cruise happens to
get cold feet and you need one more who understands boating engines
etc would like to hear from you etc”  here is another brief one
“point blank would like to have the job of cabin-boy on your trip around
the world or any other job on board  am nineteen years old weigh one
hundred and forty pounds and am an american”

and here is a good one from a man a “little over five feet long” “when i
read about your manly plan of sailing around the world in a small boat
with mrs london i was so much rejoiced that i felt i was planning it
myself and i thought to write you about filling either position of cook
or cabin-boy myself but for some reason i did not do it and i came to
denver from oakland to join my friends business last month but
everything is worse and unfavourable  but fortunately you have postponed
your departure on account of the great earthquake so i finally decided
to propose you to let me fill either of the positions  i am not very
strong being a man of a little over five feet long although i am of
sound health and capability”

“i think i can add to your outfit an additional method of utilizing the
power of the wind” wrote a well-wisher “which while not interfering
with ordinary sails in light breezes will enable you to use the whole
force of the wind in its mightiest blows so that even when its force is
so great that you may have to take in every inch of canvas used in the
ordinary way you may carry the fullest spread with my method  with my
attachment your craft could not be upset”

the foregoing letter was written in san francisco under the date of april
16 1906  and two days later on april 18 came the great earthquake
and thats why ive got it in for that earthquake for it made a refugee
out of the man who wrote the letter and prevented us from ever getting
together

many of my brother socialists objected to my making the cruise of which
the following is typical “the socialist cause and the millions of
oppressed victims of capitalism has a right and claim upon your life and
services  if however you persist then when you swallow the last
mouthful of salt chuck you can hold before sinking remember that we at
least protested”

one wanderer over the world who “could if opportunity afforded recount
many unusual scenes and events” spent several pages ardently trying to
get to the point of his letter and at last achieved the following
“still i am neglecting the point i set out to write you about  so will
say at once that it has been stated in print that you and one or two
others are going to take a cruize around the world a little fifty- or
sixty-foot boat  i therefore cannot get myself to think that a man of
your attainments and experience would attempt such a proceeding which is
nothing less than courting death in that way  and even if you were to
escape for some time your whole person and those with you would be
bruised from the ceaseless motion of a craft of the above size even if
she were padded a thing not usual at sea”  thank you kind friend
thank you for that qualification “a thing not usual at sea”  nor is
this friend ignorant of the sea  as he says of himself “i am not a
land-lubber and i have sailed every sea and ocean”  and he winds up his
letter with “although not wishing to offend it would be madness to take
any woman outside the bay even in such a craft”

and yet at the moment of writing this charmian is in her state-room at
the typewriter martin is cooking dinner tochigi is setting the table
roscoe and bert are caulking the deck and the snark is steering
herself some five knots an hour in a rattling good sea—and the snark is
not padded either

“seeing a piece in the paper about your intended trip would like to know
if you would like a good crew as there is six of us boys all good sailor
men with good discharges from the navy and merchant service all true
americans all between the ages of 20 and 22 and at present are employed
as riggers at the union iron works and would like very much to sail with
you”—it was letters like this that made me regret the boat was not
larger

and here writes the one woman in all the world—outside of charmian—for
the cruise “if you have not succeeded in getting a cook i would like
very much to take the trip in that capacity  i am a woman of fifty
healthy and capable and can do the work for the small company that
compose the crew of the snark  i am a very good cook and a very good
sailor and something of a traveller and the length of the voyage if of
ten years duration would suit me better than one  references etc”

some day when i have made a lot of money im going to build a big ship
with room in it for a thousand volunteers  they will have to do all the
work of navigating that boat around the world or theyll stay at home
i believe that theyll work the boat around the world for i know that
adventure is not dead  i know adventure is not dead because i have had a
long and intimate correspondence with adventure




chapter iv
finding ones way about


“but” our friends objected “how dare you go to sea without a navigator
on board?  youre not a navigator are you?”

i had to confess that i was not a navigator that i had never looked
through a sextant in my life and that i doubted if i could tell a
sextant from a nautical almanac  and when they asked if roscoe was a
navigator i shook my head  roscoe resented this  he had glanced at the
“epitome” bought for our voyage knew how to use logarithm tables had
seen a sextant at some time and what of this and of his seafaring
ancestry he concluded that he did know navigation  but roscoe was
wrong i still insist  when a young boy he came from maine to california
by way of the isthmus of panama and that was the only time in his life
that he was out of sight of land  he had never gone to a school of
navigation nor passed an examination in the same nor had he sailed the
deep sea and learned the art from some other navigator  he was a san
francisco bay yachtsman where land is always only several miles away and
the art of navigation is never employed

so the snark started on her long voyage without a navigator  we beat
through the golden gate on april 23 and headed for the hawaiian islands
twenty-one hundred sea-miles away as the gull flies  and the outcome was
our justification  we arrived  and we arrived furthermore without any
trouble as you shall see that is without any trouble to amount to
anything  to begin with roscoe tackled the navigating  he had the
theory all right but it was the first time he had ever applied it as
was evidenced by the erratic behaviour of the snark  not but what the
snark was perfectly steady on the sea the pranks she cut were on the
chart  on a day with a light breeze she would make a jump on the chart
that advertised “a wet sail and a flowing sheet” and on a day when she
just raced over the ocean she scarcely changed her position on the
chart  now when ones boat has logged six knots for twenty-four
consecutive hours it is incontestable that she has covered one hundred
and forty-four miles of ocean  the ocean was all right and so was the
patent log as for speed one saw it with his own eyes  therefore the
thing that was not all right was the figuring that refused to boost the
snark along over the chart  not that this happened every day but that
it did happen  and it was perfectly proper and no more than was to be
expected from a first attempt at applying a theory

the acquisition of the knowledge of navigation has a strange effect on
the minds of men  the average navigator speaks of navigation with deep
respect  to the layman navigation is a deed and awful mystery which
feeling has been generated in him by the deep and awful respect for
navigation that the layman has seen displayed by navigators  i have
known frank ingenuous and modest young men open as the day to learn
navigation and at once betray secretiveness reserve and self-importance
as if they had achieved some tremendous intellectual attainment  the
average navigator impresses the layman as a priest of some holy rite
with bated breath the amateur yachtsman navigator invites one in to look
at his chronometer  and so it was that our friends suffered such
apprehension at our sailing without a navigator

during the building of the snark roscoe and i had an agreement
something like this “ill furnish the books and instruments” i said
“and do you study up navigation now  ill be too busy to do any
studying  then when we get to sea you can teach me what you have
learned”  roscoe was delighted  furthermore roscoe was as frank and
ingenuous and modest as the young men i have described  but when we got
out to sea and he began to practise the holy rite while i looked on
admiringly a change subtle and distinctive marked his bearing  when
he shot the sun at noon the glow of achievement wrapped him in lambent
flame  when he went below figured out his observation and then
returned on deck and announced our latitude and longitude there was an
authoritative ring in his voice that was new to all of us  but that was
not the worst of it  he became filled with incommunicable information
and the more he discovered the reasons for the erratic jumps of the
snark over the chart and the less the snark jumped the more
incommunicable and holy and awful became his information  my mild
suggestions that it was about time that i began to learn met with no
hearty response with no offers on his part to help me  he displayed not
the slightest intention of living up to our agreement

now this was not roscoes fault he could not help it  he had merely
gone the way of all the men who learned navigation before him  by an
understandable and forgivable confusion of values plus a loss of
orientation he felt weighted by responsibility and experienced the
possession of power that was like unto that of a god  all his life
roscoe had lived on land and therefore in sight of land  being
constantly in sight of land with landmarks to guide him he had managed
with occasional difficulties to steer his body around and about the
earth  now he found himself on the sea wide-stretching bounded only by
the eternal circle of the sky  this circle looked always the same
there were no landmarks  the sun rose to the east and set to the west
and the stars wheeled through the night  but who may look at the sun or
the stars and say “my place on the face of the earth at the present
moment is four and three-quarter miles to the west of joness cash store
of smithersville”? or “i know where i am now for the little dipper
informs me that boston is three miles away on the second turning to the
right”?  and yet that was precisely what roscoe did  that he was
astounded by the achievement is putting it mildly  he stood in
reverential awe of himself he had performed a miraculous feat  the act
of finding himself on the face of the waters became a rite and he felt
himself a superior being to the rest of us who knew not this rite and
were dependent on him for being shepherded across the heaving and
limitless waste the briny highroad that connects the continents and
whereon there are no mile-stones  so with the sextant he made obeisance
to the sun-god he consulted ancient tomes and tables of magic
characters muttered prayers in a strange tongue that sounded like
indexerrorparallaxrefraction made cabalistic signs on paper added and
carried one and then on a piece of holy script called the grail—i mean
the chart—he placed his finger on a certain space conspicuous for its
blankness and said “here we are”  when we looked at the blank space and
asked “and where is that?” he answered in the cipher-code of the higher
priesthood “31-15-47 north 133-5-30 west”  and we said “oh” and felt
mighty small

so i aver it was not roscoes fault  he was like unto a god and he
carried us in the hollow of his hand across the blank spaces on the
chart  i experienced a great respect for roscoe this respect grew so
profound that had he commanded “kneel down and worship me” i know that
i should have flopped down on the deck and yammered  but one day there
came a still small thought to me that said “this is not a god this is
roscoe a mere man like myself  what he has done i can do  who taught
him?  himself  go you and do likewise—be your own teacher”  and right
there roscoe crashed and he was high priest of the snark no longer  i
invaded the sanctuary and demanded the ancient tomes and magic tables
also the prayer-wheel—the sextant i mean

and now in simple language  i shall describe how i taught myself
navigation  one whole afternoon i sat in the cockpit steering with one
hand and studying logarithms with the other  two afternoons two hours
each i studied the general theory of navigation and the particular
process of taking a meridian altitude  then i took the sextant worked
out the index error and shot the sun  the figuring from the data of
this observation was childs play  in the “epitome” and the “nautical
almanac” were scores of cunning tables all worked out by mathematicians
and astronomers  it was like using interest tables and
lightning-calculator tables such as you all know  the mystery was
mystery no longer  i put my finger on the chart and announced that that
was where we were  i was right too or at least i was as right as
roscoe who selected a spot a quarter of a mile away from mine  even he
was willing to split the distance with me  i had exploded the mystery
and yet such was the miracle of it i was conscious of new power in me
and i felt the thrill and tickle of pride  and when martin asked me in
the same humble and respectful way i had previously asked roscoe as to
where we were it was with exaltation and spiritual chest-throwing that i
answered in the cipher-code of the higher priesthood and heard martins
self-abasing and worshipful “oh”  as for charmian i felt that in a new
way i had proved my right to her and i was aware of another feeling
namely that she was a most fortunate woman to have a man like me

i couldnt help it  i tell it as a vindication of roscoe and all the
other navigators  the poison of power was working in me  i was not as
other men—most other men i knew what they did not know—the mystery of
the heavens that pointed out the way across the deep  and the taste of
power i had received drove me on  i steered at the wheel long hours with
one hand and studied mystery with the other  by the end of the week
teaching myself i was able to do divers things  for instance i shot
the north star at night of course got its altitude corrected for
index error dip etc and found our latitude  and this latitude agreed
with the latitude of the previous noon corrected by dead reckoning up to
that moment  proud?  well i was even prouder with my next miracle  i
was going to turn in at nine oclock  i worked out the problem
self-instructed and learned what star of the first magnitude would be
passing the meridian around half-past eight  this star proved to be
alpha crucis  i had never heard of the star before  i looked it up on
the star map  it was one of the stars of the southern cross  what
thought i have we been sailing with the southern cross in the sky of
nights and never known it?  dolts that we are  gudgeons and moles  i
couldnt believe it  i went over the problem again and verified it
charmian had the wheel from eight till ten that evening  i told her to
keep her eyes open and look due south for the southern cross  and when
the stars came out there shone the southern cross low on the horizon
proud?  no medicine man nor high priest was ever prouder  furthermore
with the prayer-wheel i shot alpha crucis and from its altitude worked
out our latitude  and still furthermore i shot the north star too and
it agreed with what had been told me by the southern cross  proud?  why
the language of the stars was mine and i listened and heard them telling
me my way over the deep

proud?  i was a worker of miracles  i forgot how easily i had taught
myself from the printed page  i forgot that all the work (and a
tremendous work too) had been done by the masterminds before me the
astronomers and mathematicians who had discovered and elaborated the
whole science of navigation and made the tables in the “epitome”  i
remembered only the everlasting miracle of it—that i had listened to the
voices of the stars and been told my place upon the highway of the sea
charmian did not know martin did not know tochigi the cabin-boy did
not know  but i told them  i was gods messenger  i stood between them
and infinity  i translated the high celestial speech into terms of their
ordinary understanding  we were heaven-directed and it was i who could
read the sign-post of the sky—i  i

and now in a cooler moment i hasten to blab the whole simplicity of it
to blab on roscoe and the other navigators and the rest of the
priesthood all for fear that i may become even as they secretive
immodest and inflated with self-esteem  and i want to say this now any
young fellow with ordinary gray matter ordinary education and with the
slightest trace of the student-mind can get the books and charts and
instruments and teach himself navigation  now i must not be
misunderstood  seamanship is an entirely different matter  it is not
learned in a day nor in many days it requires years  also navigating
by dead reckoning requires long study and practice  but navigating by
observations of the sun moon and stars thanks to the astronomers and
mathematicians is childs play  any average young fellow can teach
himself in a week  and yet again i must not be misunderstood  i do not
mean to say that at the end of a week a young fellow could take charge of
a fifteen-thousand-ton steamer driving twenty knots an hour through the
brine racing from land to land fair weather and foul clear sky or
cloudy steering by degrees on the compass card and making landfalls with
most amazing precision  but what i do mean is just this the average
young fellow i have described can get into a staunch sail-boat and put
out across the ocean without knowing anything about navigation and at
the end of the week he will know enough to know where he is on the chart
he will be able to take a meridian observation with fair accuracy and
from that observation with ten minutes of figuring work out his
latitude and longitude  and carrying neither freight nor passengers
being under no press to reach his destination he can jog comfortably
along and if at any time he doubts his own navigation and fears an
imminent landfall he can heave to all night and proceed in the morning

joshua slocum sailed around the world a few years ago in a
thirty-seven-foot boat all by himself  i shall never forget in his
narrative of the voyage where he heartily indorsed the idea of young
men in similar small boats making similar voyage  i promptly indorsed
his idea and so heartily that i took my wife along  while it certainly
makes a cooks tour look like thirty cents on top of that amid on top
of the fun and pleasure it is a splendid education for a young man—oh
not a mere education in the things of the world outside of lands and
peoples and climates but an education in the world inside an education
in ones self a chance to learn ones own self to get on speaking terms
with ones soul  then there is the training and the disciplining of it
first naturally the young fellow will learn his limitations and next
inevitably he will proceed to press back those limitations  and he
cannot escape returning from such a voyage a bigger and better man  and
as for sport it is a kings sport taking ones self around the world
doing it with ones own hands depending on no one but ones self and at
the end back at the starting-point contemplating with inner vision the
planet rushing through space and saying “i did it with my own hands i
did it  i went clear around that whirling sphere and i can travel
alone without any nurse of a sea-captain to guide my steps across the
seas  i may not fly to other stars but of this star i myself am
master”

as i write these lines i lift my eyes and look seaward  i am on the
beach of waikiki on the island of oahu  far in the azure sky the
trade-wind clouds drift low over the blue-green turquoise of the deep
sea  nearer the sea is emerald and light olive-green  then comes the
reef where the water is all slaty purple flecked with red  still nearer
are brighter greens and tans lying in alternate stripes and showing
where sandbeds lie between the living coral banks  through and over and
out of these wonderful colours tumbles and thunders a magnificent surf
as i say i lift my eyes to all this and through the white crest of a
breaker suddenly appears a dark figure erect a man-fish or a sea-god
on the very forward face of the crest where the top falls over and down
driving in toward shore buried to his loins in smoking spray caught up
by the sea and flung landward bodily a quarter of a mile  it is a
kanaka on a surf-board  and i know that when i have finished these lines
i shall be out in that riot of colour and pounding surf trying to bit
those breakers even as he and failing as he never failed but living
life as the best of us may live it  and the picture of that coloured sea
and that flying sea-god kanaka becomes another reason for the young man
to go west and farther west beyond the baths of sunset and still west
till he arrives home again

but to return  please do not think that i already know it all  i know
only the rudiments of navigation  there is a vast deal yet for me to
learn  on the snark there is a score of fascinating books on
navigation waiting for me  there is the danger-angle of lecky there is
the line of sumner which when you know least of all where you are
shows most conclusively where you are and where you are not  there are
dozens and dozens of methods of finding ones location on the deep and
one can work years before he masters it all in all its fineness

even in the little we did learn there were slips that accounted for the
apparently antic behaviour of the snark  on thursday may 16 for
instance the trade wind failed us  during the twenty-four hours that
ended friday at noon by dead reckoning we had not sailed twenty miles
yet here are our positions at noon for the two days worked out from
our observations

thursday         20°     57′      9″   n
                152°     40′     30″   w
friday           21°     15′     33″   n
                154°     12′

the difference between the two positions was something like eighty miles
yet we knew we had not travelled twenty miles  now our figuring was all
right  we went over it several times  what was wrong was the
observations we had taken  to take a correct observation requires
practice and skill and especially so on a small craft like the snark
the violently moving boat and the closeness of the observers eye to the
surface of the water are to blame  a big wave that lifts up a mile off
is liable to steal the horizon away

but in our particular case there was another perturbing factor  the sun
in its annual march north through the heavens was increasing its
declination  on the 19th parallel of north latitude in the middle of may
the sun is nearly overhead  the angle of arc was between eighty-eight
and eighty-nine degrees  had it been ninety degrees it would have been
straight overhead  it was on another day that we learned a few things
about taking the altitude of the almost perpendicular sun  roscoe
started in drawing the sun down to the eastern horizon and he stayed by
that point of the compass despite the fact that the sun would pass the
meridian to the south  i on the other hand started in to draw the sun
down to south-east and strayed away to the south-west  you see we were
teaching ourselves  as a result at twenty-five minutes past twelve by
the ships time i called twelve oclock by the sun  now this signified
that we had changed our location on the face of the world by twenty-five
minutes which was equal to something like six degrees of longitude or
three hundred and fifty miles  this showed the snark had travelled
fifteen knots per hour for twenty-four consecutive hours—and we had never
noticed it  it was absurd and grotesque  but roscoe still looking
east averred that it was not yet twelve oclock  he was bent on giving
us a twenty-knot clip  then we began to train our sextants rather wildly
all around the horizon and wherever we looked there was the sun
puzzlingly close to the sky-line sometimes above it and sometimes below
it  in one direction the sun was proclaiming morning in another
direction it was proclaiming afternoon  the sun was all right—we knew
that therefore we were all wrong  and the rest of the afternoon we
spent in the cockpit reading up the matter in the books and finding out
what was wrong  we missed the observation that day but we didnt the
next  we had learned

and we learned well better than for a while we thought we had  at the
beginning of the second dog-watch one evening charmian and i sat down on
the forecastle-head for a rubber of cribbage  chancing to glance ahead
i saw cloud-capped mountains rising from the sea  we were rejoiced at
the sight of land but i was in despair over our navigation  i thought
we had learned something yet our position at noon plus what we had run
since did not put us within a hundred miles of land  but there was the
land fading away before our eyes in the fires of sunset  the land was
all right  there was no disputing it  therefore our navigation was all
wrong  but it wasnt  that land we saw was the summit of haleakala the
house of the sun the greatest extinct volcano in the world  it towered
ten thousand feet above the sea and it was all of a hundred miles away
we sailed all night at a seven-knot clip and in the morning the house of
the sun was still before us and it took a few more hours of sailing to
bring it abreast of us  “that island is maui” we said verifying by the
chart  “that next island sticking out is molokai where the lepers are
and the island next to that is oahu  there is makapuu head now  well
be in honolulu to-morrow  our navigation is all right”




chapter v
the first landfall


“it will not be so monotonous at sea” i promised my fellow-voyagers on
the snark  “the sea is filled with life  it is so populous that every
day something new is happening  almost as soon as we pass through the
golden gate and head south well pick up with the flying fish  well be
having them fried for breakfast  well be catching bonita and dolphin
and spearing porpoises from the bowsprit  and then there are the
sharks—sharks without end”

we passed through the golden gate and headed south  we dropped the
mountains of california beneath the horizon and daily the surf grew
warmer  but there were no flying fish no bonita and dolphin  the ocean
was bereft of life  never had i sailed on so forsaken a sea  always
before in the same latitudes had i encountered flying fish

“never mind” i said  “wait till we get off the coast of southern
california  then well pick up the flying fish”

we came abreast of southern california abreast of the peninsula of lower
california abreast of the coast of mexico and there were no flying
fish  nor was there anything else  no life moved  as the days went by
the absence of life became almost uncanny

“never mind” i said  “when we do pick up with the flying fish well
pick up with everything else  the flying fish is the staff of life for
all the other breeds  everything will come in a bunch when we find the
flying fish”

when i should have headed the snark south-west for hawaii i still held
her south  i was going to find those flying fish  finally the time came
when if i wanted to go to honolulu i should have headed the snark due
west instead of which i kept her south  not until latitude 19° did we
encounter the first flying fish  he was very much alone  i saw him
five other pairs of eager eyes scanned the sea all day but never saw
another  so sparse were the flying fish that nearly a week more elapsed
before the last one on board saw his first flying fish  as for the
dolphin bonita porpoise and all the other hordes of life—there werent
any

not even a shark broke surface with his ominous dorsal fin  bert took a
dip daily under the bowsprit hanging on to the stays and dragging his
body through the water  and daily he canvassed the project of letting go
and having a decent swim  i did my best to dissuade him  but with him i
had lost all standing as an authority on sea life

“if there are sharks” he demanded “why dont they show up?”

i assured him that if he really did let go and have a swim the sharks
would promptly appear  this was a bluff on my part  i didnt believe
it  it lasted as a deterrent for two days  the third day the wind fell
calm and it was pretty hot  the snark was moving a knot an hour
bert dropped down under the bowsprit and let go  and now behold the
perversity of things  we had sailed across two thousand miles and more
of ocean and had met with no sharks  within five minutes after bert
finished his swim the fin of a shark was cutting the surface in circles
around the snark

there was something wrong about that shark  it bothered me  it had no
right to be there in that deserted ocean  the more i thought about it
the more incomprehensible it became  but two hours later we sighted land
and the mystery was cleared up  he had come to us from the land and not
from the uninhabited deep  he had presaged the landfall  he was the
messenger of the land

twenty-seven days out from san francisco we arrived at the island of
oahu territory of hawaii  in the early morning we drifted around
diamond head into full view of honolulu and then the ocean burst
suddenly into life  flying fish cleaved the air in glittering squadrons
in five minutes we saw more of them than during the whole voyage  other
fish large ones of various sorts leaped into the air  there was life
everywhere on sea and shore  we could see the masts and funnels of the
shipping in the harbour the hotels and bathers along the beach at
waikiki the smoke rising from the dwelling-houses high up on the
volcanic slopes of the punch bowl and tantalus  the custom-house tug was
racing toward us and a big school of porpoises got under our bow and
began cutting the most ridiculous capers  the port doctors launch came
charging out at us and a big sea turtle broke the surface with his back
and took a look at us  never was there such a burgeoning of life
strange faces were on our decks strange voices were speaking and copies
of that very mornings newspaper with cable reports from all the world
were thrust before our eyes  incidentally we read that the snark and
all hands had been lost at sea and that she had been a very unseaworthy
craft anyway  and while we read this information a wireless message was
being received by the congressional party on the summit of haleakala
announcing the safe arrival of the snark

it was the snarks first landfall—and such a landfall  for
twenty-seven days we had been on the deserted deep and it was pretty
hard to realize that there was so much life in the world  we were made
dizzy by it  we could not take it all in at once  we were like awakened
rip van winkles and it seemed to us that we were dreaming  on one side
the azure sea lapped across the horizon into the azure sky on the other
side the sea lifted itself into great breakers of emerald that fell in a
snowy smother upon a white coral beach  beyond the beach green
plantations of sugar-cane undulated gently upward to steeper slopes
which in turn became jagged volcanic crests drenched with tropic
showers and capped by stupendous masses of trade-wind clouds  at any
rate it was a most beautiful dream  the snark turned and headed
directly in toward the emerald surf till it lifted and thundered on
either hand and on either hand scarce a biscuit-toss away the reef
showed its long teeth pale green and menacing

abruptly the land itself in a riot of olive-greens of a thousand hues
reached out its arms and folded the snark in  there was no perilous
passage through the reef no emerald surf and azure sea—nothing but a
warm soft land a motionless lagoon and tiny beaches on which swam
dark-skinned tropic children  the sea had disappeared  the snarks
anchor rumbled the chain through the hawse-pipe and we lay without
movement on a “lineless level floor”  it was all so beautiful and
strange that we could not accept it as real  on the chart this place was
called pearl harbour but we called it dream harbour

a launch came off to us in it were members of the hawaiian yacht club
come to greet us and make us welcome with true hawaiian hospitality to
all they had  they were ordinary men flesh and blood and all the rest
but they did not tend to break our dreaming  our last memories of men
were of united states marshals and of panicky little merchants with rusty
dollars for souls who in a reeking atmosphere of soot and coal-dust
laid grimy hands upon the snark and held her back from her world
adventure  but these men who came to meet us were clean men  a healthy
tan was on their cheeks and their eyes were not dazzled and bespectacled
from gazing overmuch at glittering dollar-heaps  no they merely
verified the dream  they clinched it with their unsmirched souls

so we went ashore with them across a level flashing sea to the wonderful
green land  we landed on a tiny wharf and the dream became more
insistent for know that for twenty-seven days we had been rocking across
the ocean on the tiny snark  not once in all those twenty-seven days
had we known a moments rest a moments cessation from movement  this
ceaseless movement had become ingrained  body and brain we had rocked
and rolled so long that when we climbed out on the tiny wharf kept on
rocking and rolling  this naturally we attributed to the wharf  it
was projected psychology  i spraddled along the wharf and nearly fell
into the water  i glanced at charmian and the way she walked made me
sad  the wharf had all the seeming of a ships deck  it lifted tilted
heaved and sank and since there were no handrails on it it kept
charmian and me busy avoiding falling in  i never saw such a
preposterous little wharf  whenever i watched it closely it refused to
roll but as soon as i took my attention off from it away it went just
like the snark  once i caught it in the act just as it upended and
i looked down the length of it for two hundred feet and for all the
world it was like the deck of a ship ducking into a huge head-sea

at last however supported by our hosts we negotiated the wharf and
gained the land  but the land was no better  the very first thing it
did was to tilt up on one side and far as the eye could see i watched it
tilt clear to its jagged volcanic backbone and i saw the clouds above
tilt too  this was no stable firm-founded land else it would not cut
such capers  it was like all the rest of our landfall unreal  it was a
dream  at any moment like shifting vapour it might dissolve away  the
thought entered my head that perhaps it was my fault that my head was
swimming or that something i had eaten had disagreed with me  but i
glanced at charmian and her sad walk and even as i glanced i saw her
stagger and bump into the yachtsman by whose side she walked  i spoke to
her and she complained about the antic behaviour of the land

we walked across a spacious wonderful lawn and down an avenue of royal
palms and across more wonderful lawn in the gracious shade of stately
trees  the air was filled with the songs of birds and was heavy with
rich warm fragrances—wafture from great lilies and blazing blossoms of
hibiscus and other strange gorgeous tropic flowers  the dream was
becoming almost impossibly beautiful to us who for so long had seen
naught but the restless salty sea  charmian reached out her hand and
clung to me—for support against the ineffable beauty of it thought i
but no  as i supported her i braced my legs while the flowers and lawns
reeled and swung around me  it was like an earthquake only it quickly
passed without doing any harm  it was fairly difficult to catch the land
playing these tricks  as long as i kept my mind on it nothing happened
but as soon as my attention was distracted away it went the whole
panorama swinging and heaving and tilting at all sorts of angles  once
however i turned my head suddenly and caught that stately line of royal
palms swinging in a great arc across the sky  but it stopped just as
soon as i caught it and became a placid dream again

next we came to a house of coolness with great sweeping veranda where
lotus-eaters might dwell  windows and doors were wide open to the
breeze and the songs and fragrances blew lazily in and out  the walls
were hung with tapa-cloths  couches with grass-woven covers invited
everywhere and there was a grand piano that played i was sure nothing
more exciting than lullabies  servants—japanese maids in native
costume—drifted around and about noiselessly like butterflies
everything was preternaturally cool  here was no blazing down of a
tropic sun upon an unshrinking sea  it was too good to be true  but it
was not real  it was a dream-dwelling  i knew for i turned suddenly
and caught the grand piano cavorting in a spacious corner of the room  i
did not say anything for just then we were being received by a gracious
woman a beautiful madonna clad in flowing white and shod with sandals
who greeted us as though she had known us always

we sat at table on the lotus-eating veranda served by the butterfly
maids and ate strange foods and partook of a nectar called poi  but the
dream threatened to dissolve  it shimmered and trembled like an
iridescent bubble about to break  i was just glancing out at the green
grass and stately trees and blossoms of hibiscus when suddenly i felt
the table move  the table and the madonna across from me and the
veranda of the lotus-eaters the scarlet hibiscus the greensward and the
trees—all lifted and tilted before my eyes and heaved and sank down into
the trough of a monstrous sea  i gripped my chair convulsively and held
on  i had a feeling that i was holding on to the dream as well as the
chair  i should not have been surprised had the sea rushed in and
drowned all that fairyland and had i found myself at the wheel of the
snark just looking up casually from the study of logarithms  but the
dream persisted  i looked covertly at the madonna and her husband  they
evidenced no perturbation  the dishes had not moved upon the table  the
hibiscus and trees and grass were still there  nothing had changed  i
partook of more nectar and the dream was more real than ever

“will you have some iced tea?” asked the madonna and then her side of
the table sank down gently and i said yes to her at an angle of
forty-five degrees

“speaking of sharks” said her husband “up at niihau there was a man—”
and at that moment the table lifted and heaved and i gazed upward at him
at an angle of forty-five degrees

so the luncheon went on and i was glad that i did not have to bear the
affliction of watching charmian walk  suddenly however a mysterious
word of fear broke from the lips of the lotus-eaters  “ah ah” thought
i “now the dream goes glimmering”  i clutched the chair desperately
resolved to drag back to the reality of the snark some tangible vestige
of this lotus land  i felt the whole dream lurching and pulling to be
gone  just then the mysterious word of fear was repeated  it sounded
like reporters  i looked and saw three of them coming across the lawn
oh blessed reporters  then the dream was indisputably real after all
i glanced out across the shining water and saw the snark at anchor and
i remembered that i had sailed in her from san francisco to hawaii and
that this was pearl harbour and that even then i was acknowledging
introductions and saying in reply to the first question “yes we had
delightful weather all the way down”




chapter vi
a royal sport


that is what it is a royal sport for the natural kings of earth  the
grass grows right down to the water at waikiki beach and within fifty
feet of the everlasting sea  the trees also grow down to the salty edge
of things and one sits in their shade and looks seaward at a majestic
surf thundering in on the beach to ones very feet  half a mile out
where is the reef the white-headed combers thrust suddenly skyward out
of the placid turquoise-blue and come rolling in to shore  one after
another they come a mile long with smoking crests the white battalions
of the infinite army of the sea  and one sits and listens to the
perpetual roar and watches the unending procession and feels tiny and
fragile before this tremendous force expressing itself in fury and foam
and sound  indeed one feels microscopically small and the thought that
one may wrestle with this sea raises in ones imagination a thrill of
apprehension almost of fear  why they are a mile long these
bull-mouthed monsters and they weigh a thousand tons and they charge in
to shore faster than a man can run  what chance?  no chance at all is
the verdict of the shrinking ego and one sits and looks and listens
and thinks the grass and the shade are a pretty good place in which to
be

and suddenly out there where a big smoker lifts skyward rising like a
sea-god from out of the welter of spume and churning white on the giddy
toppling overhanging and downfalling precarious crest appears the dark
head of a man  swiftly he rises through the rushing white  his black
shoulders his chest his loins his limbs—all is abruptly projected on
ones vision  where but the moment before was only the wide desolation
and invincible roar is now a man erect full-statured not struggling
frantically in that wild movement not buried and crushed and buffeted by
those mighty monsters but standing above them all calm and superb
poised on the giddy summit his feet buried in the churning foam the
salt smoke rising to his knees and all the rest of him in the free air
and flashing sunlight and he is flying through the air flying forward
flying fast as the surge on which he stands  he is a mercury—a brown
mercury  his heels are winged and in them is the swiftness of the sea
in truth from out of the sea he has leaped upon the back of the sea and
he is riding the sea that roars and bellows and cannot shake him from its
back  but no frantic outreaching and balancing is his  he is impassive
motionless as a statue carved suddenly by some miracle out of the seas
depth from which he rose  and straight on toward shore he flies on his
winged heels and the white crest of the breaker  there is a wild burst
of foam a long tumultuous rushing sound as the breaker falls futile and
spent on the beach at your feet and there at your feet steps calmly
ashore a kanaka burnt golden and brown by the tropic sun  several
minutes ago he was a speck a quarter of a mile away  he has “bitted the
bull-mouthed breaker” and ridden it in and the pride in the feat shows
in the carriage of his magnificent body as he glances for a moment
carelessly at you who sit in the shade of the shore  he is a kanaka—and
more he is a man a member of the kingly species that has mastered
matter and the brutes and lorded it over creation

and one sits and thinks of tristrams last wrestle with the sea on that
fatal morning and one thinks further to the fact that that kanaka has
done what tristram never did and that he knows a joy of the sea that
tristram never knew  and still further one thinks  it is all very well
sitting here in cool shade of the beach but you are a man one of the
kingly species and what that kanaka can do you can do yourself  go to
strip off your clothes that are a nuisance in this mellow clime  get in
and wrestle with the sea wing your heels with the skill and power that
reside in you bit the seas breakers master them and ride upon their
backs as a king should

and that is how it came about that i tackled surf-riding  and now that i
have tackled it more than ever do i hold it to be a royal sport  but
first let me explain the physics of it  a wave is a communicated
agitation  the water that composes the body of a wave does not move  if
it did when a stone is thrown into a pond and the ripples spread away in
an ever widening circle there would appear at the centre an ever
increasing hole  no the water that composes the body of a wave is
stationary  thus you may watch a particular portion of the oceans
surface and you will see the sane water rise and fall a thousand times to
the agitation communicated by a thousand successive waves  now imagine
this communicated agitation moving shoreward  as the bottom shoals the
lower portion of the wave strikes land first and is stopped  but water
is fluid and the upper portion has not struck anything wherefore it
keeps on communicating its agitation keeps on going  and when the top
of the wave keeps on going while the bottom of it lags behind something
is bound to happen  the bottom of the wave drops out from under and the
top of the wave falls over forward and down curling and cresting and
roaring as it does so  it is the bottom of a wave striking against the
top of the land that is the cause of all surfs

but the transformation from a smooth undulation to a breaker is not
abrupt except where the bottom shoals abruptly  say the bottom shoals
gradually for from quarter of a mile to a mile then an equal distance
will be occupied by the transformation  such a bottom is that off the
beach of waikiki and it produces a splendid surf-riding surf  one leaps
upon the back of a breaker just as it begins to break and stays on it as
it continues to break all the way in to shore

and now to the particular physics of surf-riding  get out on a flat
board six feet long two feet wide and roughly oval in shape  lie down
upon it like a small boy on a coaster and paddle with your hands out to
deep water where the waves begin to crest  lie out there quietly on the
board  sea after sea breaks before behind and under and over you and
rushes in to shore leaving you behind  when a wave crests it gets
steeper  imagine yourself on your hoard on the face of that steep
slope  if it stood still you would slide down just as a boy slides down
a hill on his coaster  “but” you object “the wave doesnt stand
still”  very true but the water composing the wave stands still and
there you have the secret  if ever you start sliding down the face of
that wave youll keep on sliding and youll never reach the bottom
please dont laugh  the face of that wave may be only six feet yet you
can slide down it a quarter of a mile or half a mile and not reach the
bottom  for see since a wave is only a communicated agitation or
impetus and since the water that composes a wave is changing every
instant new water is rising into the wave as fast as the wave travels
you slide down this new water and yet remain in your old position on the
wave sliding down the still newer water that is rising and forming the
wave  you slide precisely as fast as the wave travels  if it travels
fifteen miles an hour you slide fifteen miles an hour  between you and
shore stretches a quarter of mile of water  as the wave travels this
water obligingly heaps itself into the wave gravity does the rest and
down you go sliding the whole length of it  if you still cherish the
notion while sliding that the water is moving with you thrust your
arms into it and attempt to paddle you will find that you have to be
remarkably quick to get a stroke for that water is dropping astern just
as fast as you are rushing ahead

and now for another phase of the physics of surf-riding  all rules have
their exceptions  it is true that the water in a wave does not travel
forward  but there is what may be called the send of the sea  the water
in the overtoppling crest does move forward as you will speedily realize
if you are slapped in the face by it or if you are caught under it and
are pounded by one mighty blow down under the surface panting and gasping
for half a minute  the water in the top of a wave rests upon the water
in the bottom of the wave  but when the bottom of the wave strikes the
land it stops while the top goes on  it no longer has the bottom of
the wave to hold it up  where was solid water beneath it is now air
and for the first time it feels the grip of gravity and down it falls
at the same time being torn asunder from the lagging bottom of the wave
and flung forward  and it is because of this that riding a surf-board is
something more than a mere placid sliding down a hill  in truth one is
caught up and hurled shoreward as by some titans hand

i deserted the cool shade put on a swimming suit and got hold of a
surf-board  it was too small a board  but i didnt know and nobody
told me  i joined some little kanaka boys in shallow water where the
breakers were well spent and small—a regular kindergarten school  i
watched the little kanaka boys  when a likely-looking breaker came
along they flopped upon their stomachs on their boards kicked like mad
with their feet and rode the breaker in to the beach  i tried to
emulate them  i watched them tried to do everything that they did and
failed utterly  the breaker swept past and i was not on it  i tried
again and again  i kicked twice as madly as they did and failed  half
a dozen would be around  we would all leap on our boards in front of a
good breaker  away our feet would churn like the stern-wheels of river
steamboats and away the little rascals would scoot while i remained in
disgrace behind

i tried for a solid hour and not one wave could i persuade to boost me
shoreward  and then arrived a friend alexander hume ford a globe
trotter by profession bent ever on the pursuit of sensation  and he had
found it at waikiki  heading for australia he had stopped off for a
week to find out if there were any thrills in surf-riding and he had
become wedded to it  he had been at it every day for a month and could
not yet see any symptoms of the fascination lessening on him  he spoke
with authority

“get off that board” he said  “chuck it away at once  look at the way
youre trying to ride it  if ever the nose of that board hits bottom
youll be disembowelled  here take my board  its a mans size”

i am always humble when confronted by knowledge  ford knew  he showed
me how properly to mount his board  then he waited for a good breaker
gave me a shove at the right moment and started me in  ah delicious
moment when i felt that breaker grip and fling me

on i dashed a hundred and fifty feet and subsided with the breaker on
the sand  from that moment i was lost  i waded back to ford with his
board  it was a large one several inches thick and weighed all of
seventy-five pounds  he gave me advice much of it  he had had no one
to teach him and all that he had laboriously learned in several weeks he
communicated to me in half an hour  i really learned by proxy  and
inside of half an hour i was able to start myself and ride in  i did it
time after time and ford applauded and advised  for instance he told
me to get just so far forward on the board and no farther  but i must
have got some farther for as i came charging in to land that miserable
board poked its nose down to bottom stopped abruptly and turned a
somersault at the same time violently severing our relations  i was
tossed through the air like a chip and buried ignominiously under the
downfalling breaker  and i realized that if it hadnt been for ford id
have been disembowelled  that particular risk is part of the sport ford
says  maybe hell have it happen to him before he leaves waikiki and
then i feel confident his yearning for sensation will be satisfied for
a time

when all is said and done it is my steadfast belief that homicide is
worse than suicide especially if in the former case it is a woman
ford saved me from being a homicide  “imagine your legs are a rudder”
he said  “hold them close together and steer with them”  a few minutes
later i came charging in on a comber  as i neared the beach there in
the water up to her waist dead in front of me appeared a woman  how
was i to stop that comber on whose back i was?  it looked like a dead
woman  the board weighed seventy-five pounds i weighed a hundred and
sixty-five  the added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour
the board and i constituted a projectile  i leave it to the physicists
to figure out the force of the impact upon that poor tender woman  and
then i remembered my guardian angel ford  “steer with your legs” rang
through my brain  i steered with my legs i steered sharply abruptly
with all my legs and with all my might  the board sheered around
broadside on the crest  many things happened simultaneously  the wave
gave me a passing buffet a light tap as the taps of waves go but a tap
sufficient to knock me off the board and smash me down through the
rushing water to bottom with which i came in violent collision and upon
which i was rolled over and over  i got my head out for a breath of air
and then gained my feet  there stood the woman before me  i felt like a
hero  i had saved her life  and she laughed at me  it was not
hysteria  she had never dreamed of her danger  anyway i solaced
myself it was not i but ford that saved her and i didnt have to feel
like a hero  and besides that leg-steering was great  in a few minutes
more of practice i was able to thread my way in and out past several
bathers and to remain on top my breaker instead of going under it

“to-morrow” ford said “i am going to take you out into the blue water”

i looked seaward where he pointed and saw the great smoking combers that
made the breakers i had been riding look like ripples  i dont know what
i might have said had i not recollected just then that i was one of a
kingly species  so all that i did say was “all right ill tackle them
to-morrow”

the water that rolls in on waikiki beach is just the same as the water
that laves the shores of all the hawaiian islands and in ways
especially from the swimmers standpoint it is wonderful water  it is
cool enough to be comfortable while it is warm enough to permit a
swimmer to stay in all day without experiencing a chill  under the sun
or the stars at high noon or at midnight in midwinter or in midsummer
it does not matter when it is always the same temperature—not too warm
not too cold just right  it is wonderful water salt as old ocean
itself pure and crystal-clear  when the nature of the water is
considered it is not so remarkable after all that the kanakas are one of
the most expert of swimming races

so it was next morning when ford came along that i plunged into the
wonderful water for a swim of indeterminate length  astride of our
surf-boards or rather flat down upon them on our stomachs we paddled
out through the kindergarten where the little kanaka boys were at play
soon we were out in deep water where the big smokers came roaring in
the mere struggle with them facing them and paddling seaward over them
and through them was sport enough in itself  one had to have his wits
about him for it was a battle in which mighty blows were struck on one
side and in which cunning was used on the other side—a struggle between
insensate force and intelligence  i soon learned a bit  when a breaker
curled over my head for a swift instant i could see the light of day
through its emerald body then down would go my head and i would clutch
the board with all my strength  then would come the blow and to the
onlooker on shore i would be blotted out  in reality the board and i
have passed through the crest and emerged in the respite of the other
side  i should not recommend those smashing blows to an invalid or
delicate person  there is weight behind them and the impact of the
driven water is like a sandblast  sometimes one passes through half a
dozen combers in quick succession and it is just about that time that he
is liable to discover new merits in the stable land and new reasons for
being on shore

out there in the midst of such a succession of big smoky ones a third
man was added to our party one freeth  shaking the water from my eyes
as i emerged from one wave and peered ahead to see what the next one
looked like i saw him tearing in on the back of it standing upright on
his board carelessly poised a young god bronzed with sunburn  we went
through the wave on the back of which he rode  ford called to him  he
turned an airspring from his wave rescued his board from its maw
paddled over to us and joined ford in showing me things  one thing in
particular i learned from freeth namely how to encounter the occasional
breaker of exceptional size that rolled in  such breakers were really
ferocious and it was unsafe to meet them on top of the board  but
freeth showed me so that whenever i saw one of that calibre rolling down
on me i slid off the rear end of the board and dropped down beneath the
surface my arms over my head and holding the board  thus if the wave
ripped the board out of my hands and tried to strike me with it (a common
trick of such waves) there would be a cushion of water a foot or more in
depth between my head and the blow  when the wave passed i climbed
upon the board and paddled on  many men have been terribly injured i
learn by being struck by their boards

the whole method of surf-riding and surf-fighting learned is one of
non-resistance  dodge the blow that is struck at you  dive through the
wave that is trying to slap you in the face  sink down feet first deep
under the surface and let the big smoker that is trying to smash you go
by far overhead  never be rigid  relax  yield yourself to the waters
that are ripping and tearing at you  when the undertow catches you and
drags you seaward along the bottom dont struggle against it  if you
do you are liable to be drowned for it is stronger than you  yield
yourself to that undertow  swim with it not against it and you will
find the pressure removed  and swimming with it fooling it so that it
does not hold you swim upward at the same time  it will be no trouble
at all to reach the surface

the man who wants to learn surf-riding must be a strong swimmer and he
must be used to going under the water  after that fair strength and
common-sense are all that is required  the force of the big comber is
rather unexpected  there are mix-ups in which board and rider are torn
apart and separated by several hundred feet  the surf-rider must take
care of himself  no matter how many riders swim out with him he cannot
depend upon any of them for aid  the fancied security i had in the
presence of ford and freeth made me forget that it was my first swim out
in deep water among the big ones  i recollected however and rather
suddenly for a big wave came in and away went the two men on its back
all the way to shore  i could have been drowned a dozen different ways
before they got back to me

one slides down the face of a breaker on his surf-board but he has to
get started to sliding  board and rider must be moving shoreward at a
good rate before the wave overtakes them  when you see the wave coming
that you want to ride in you turn tail to it and paddle shoreward with
all your strength using what is called the windmill stroke  this is a
sort of spurt performed immediately in front of the wave  if the board
is going fast enough the wave accelerates it and the board begins its
quarter-of-a-mile slide

i shall never forget the first big wave i caught out there in the deep
water  i saw it coming turned my back on it and paddled for dear life
faster and faster my board went till it seemed my arms would drop off
what was happening behind me i could not tell  one cannot look behind
and paddle the windmill stroke  i heard the crest of the wave hissing
and churning and then my board was lifted and flung forward  i scarcely
knew what happened the first half-minute  though i kept my eyes open i
could not see anything for i was buried in the rushing white of the
crest  but i did not mind  i was chiefly conscious of ecstatic bliss at
having caught the wave  at the end of the half-minute however i began
to see things and to breathe  i saw that three feet of the nose of my
board was clear out of water and riding on the air  i shifted my weight
forward and made the nose come down  then i lay quite at rest in the
midst of the wild movement and watched the shore and the bathers on the
beach grow distinct  i didnt cover quite a quarter of a mile on that
wave because to prevent the board from diving i shifted my weight
back but shifted it too far and fell down the rear slope of the wave

it was my second day at surf-riding and i was quite proud of myself  i
stayed out there four hours and when it was over i was resolved that on
the morrow id come in standing up  but that resolution paved a distant
place  on the morrow i was in bed  i was not sick but i was very
unhappy and i was in bed  when describing the wonderful water of hawaii
i forgot to describe the wonderful sun of hawaii  it is a tropic sun
and furthermore in the first part of june it is an overhead sun  it
is also an insidious deceitful sun  for the first time in my life i was
sunburned unawares  my arms shoulders and back had been burned many
times in the past and were tough but not so my legs  and for four hours
i had exposed the tender backs of my legs at right-angles to that
perpendicular hawaiian sun  it was not until after i got ashore that i
discovered the sun had touched me  sunburn at first is merely warm
after that it grows intense and the blisters come out  also the joints
where the skin wrinkles refuse to bend  that is why i spent the next
day in bed  i couldnt walk  and that is why to-day i am writing this
in bed  it is easier to than not to  but to-morrow ah to-morrow i
shall be out in that wonderful water and i shall come in standing up
even as ford and freeth  and if i fail to-morrow i shall do it the next
day or the next  upon one thing i am resolved the snark shall not
sail from honolulu until i too wing my heels with the swiftness of the
sea and become a sun-burned skin-peeling mercury




chapter vii
the lepers of molokai


when the snark sailed along the windward coast of molokai on her way
to honolulu i looked at the chart then pointed to a low-lying peninsula
backed by a tremendous cliff varying from two to four thousand feet in
height and said “the pit of hell the most cursed place on earth”  i
should have been shocked if at that moment i could have caught a
vision of myself a month later ashore in the most cursed place on earth
and having a disgracefully good time along with eight hundred of the
lepers who were likewise having a good time  their good time was not
disgraceful but mine was for in the midst of so much misery it was not
meet for me to have a good time  that is the way i felt about it and my
only excuse is that i couldnt help having a good time

for instance in the afternoon of the fourth of july all the lepers
gathered at the race-track for the sports  i had wandered away from the
superintendent and the physicians in order to get a snapshot of the
finish of one of the races  it was an interesting race and partisanship
ran high  three horses were entered one ridden by a chinese one by an
hawaiian and one by a portuguese boy  all three riders were lepers so
were the judges and the crowd  the race was twice around the track  the
chinese and the hawaiian got away together and rode neck and neck the
portuguese boy toiling along two hundred feet behind  around they went
in the same positions  halfway around on the second and final lap the
chinese pulled away and got one length ahead of the hawaiian  at the
same time the portuguese boy was beginning to crawl up  but it looked
hopeless  the crowd went wild  all the lepers were passionate lovers of
horseflesh  the portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer  i went wild
too  they were on the home stretch  the portuguese boy passed the
hawaiian  there was a thunder of hoofs a rush of the three horses
bunched together the jockeys plying their whips and every last onlooker
bursting his throat or hers with shouts and yells  nearer nearer
inch by inch the portuguese boy crept up and passed yes passed
winning by a head from the chinese  i came to myself in a group of
lepers  they were yelling tossing their hats and dancing around like
fiends  so was i  when i came to i was waving my hat and murmuring
ecstatically “by golly the boy wins  the boy wins”

i tried to check myself  i assured myself that i was witnessing one of
the horrors of molokai and that it was shameful for me under such
circumstances to be so light-hearted and light-headed  but it was no
use  the next event was a donkey-race and it was just starting so was
the fun  the last donkey in was to win the race and what complicated
the affair was that no rider rode his own donkey  they rode one
anothers donkeys the result of which was that each man strove to make
the donkey he rode beat his own donkey ridden by some one else
naturally only men possessing very slow or extremely obstreperous
donkeys had entered them for the race  one donkey had been trained to
tuck in its legs and lie down whenever its rider touched its sides with
his heels  some donkeys strove to turn around and come back others
developed a penchant for the side of the track where they stuck their
heads over the railing and stopped while all of them dawdled  halfway
around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider  when
all the rest of the donkeys had crossed the wire that particular donkey
was still arguing  he won the race though his rider lost it and came in
on foot  and all the while nearly a thousand lepers were laughing
uproariously at the fun  anybody in my place would have joined with them
in having a good time

all the foregoing is by way of preamble to the statement that the horrors
of molokai as they have been painted in the past do not exist  the
settlement has been written up repeatedly by sensationalists and usually
by sensationalists who have never laid eyes on it  of course leprosy is
leprosy and it is a terrible thing but so much that is lurid has been
written about molokai that neither the lepers nor those who devote their
lives to them have received a fair deal  here is a case in point  a
newspaper writer who of course had never been near the settlement
vividly described superintendent mcveigh crouching in a grass hut and
being besieged nightly by starving lepers on their knees wailing for
food  this hair-raising account was copied by the press all over the
united states and was the cause of many indignant and protesting
editorials  well i lived and slept for five days in mr mcveighs
“grass hut” (which was a comfortable wooden cottage by the way and
there isnt a grass house in the whole settlement) and i heard the
lepers wailing for food—only the wailing was peculiarly harmonious and
rhythmic and it was accompanied by the music of stringed instruments
violins guitars ukuleles and banjos  also the wailing was of
various sorts  the leper brass band wailed and two singing societies
wailed and lastly a quintet of excellent voices wailed  so much for a
lie that should never have been printed  the wailing was the serenade
which the glee clubs always give mr mcveigh when he returns from a trip
to honolulu

leprosy is not so contagious as is imagined  i went for a weeks visit
to the settlement and i took my wife along—all of which would not have
happened had we had any apprehension of contracting the disease  nor did
we wear long gauntleted gloves and keep apart from the lepers  on the
contrary we mingled freely with them and before we left knew scores of
them by sight and name  the precautions of simple cleanliness seem to be
all that is necessary  on returning to their own houses after having
been among and handling lepers the non-lepers such as the physicians
and the superintendent merely wash their faces and hands with mildly
antiseptic soap and change their coats

that a leper is unclean however should be insisted upon and the
segregation of lepers from what little is known of the disease should
be rigidly maintained  on the other hand the awful horror with which
the leper has been regarded in the past and the frightful treatment he
has received have been unnecessary and cruel  in order to dispel some
of the popular misapprehensions of leprosy i want to tell something of
the relations between the lepers and non-lepers as i observed them at
molokai  on the morning after our arrival charmian and i attended a
shoot of the kalaupapa rifle club and caught our first glimpse of the
democracy of affliction and alleviation that obtains  the club was just
beginning a prize shoot for a cup put up by mr mcveigh who is also a
member of the club as also are dr goodhue and dr hollmann the
resident physicians (who by the way live in the settlement with their
wives)  all about us in the shooting booth were the lepers  lepers
and non-lepers were using the same guns and all were rubbing shoulders
in the confined space  the majority of the lepers were hawaiians
sitting beside me on a bench was a norwegian  directly in front of me
in the stand was an american a veteran of the civil war who had fought
on the confederate side  he was sixty-five years of age but that did
not prevent him from running up a good score  strapping hawaiian
policemen lepers khaki-clad were also shooting as were portuguese
chinese and kokuas—the latter are native helpers in the settlement who
are non-lepers  and on the afternoon that charmian and i climbed the
two-thousand-foot pali and looked our last upon the settlement the
superintendent the doctors and the mixture of nationalities and of
diseased and non-diseased were all engaged in an exciting baseball game

not so was the leper and his greatly misunderstood and feared disease
treated during the middle ages in europe  at that time the leper was
considered legally and politically dead  he was placed in a funeral
procession and led to the church where the burial service was read over
him by the officiating clergyman  then a spadeful of earth was dropped
upon his chest and he was dead-living dead  while this rigorous
treatment was largely unnecessary nevertheless one thing was learned by
it  leprosy was unknown in europe until it was introduced by the
returning crusaders whereupon it spread slowly until it had seized upon
large numbers of the people  obviously it was a disease that could be
contracted by contact  it was a contagion and it was equally obvious
that it could be eradicated by segregation  terrible and monstrous as
was the treatment of the leper in those days the great lesson of
segregation was learned  by its means leprosy was stamped out

and by the same means leprosy is even now decreasing in the hawaiian
islands  but the segregation of the lepers on molokai is not the
horrible nightmare that has been so often exploited by yellow writers
in the first place the leper is not torn ruthlessly from his family
when a suspect is discovered he is invited by the board of health to
come to the kalihi receiving station at honolulu  his fare and all
expenses are paid for him  he is first passed upon by microscopical
examination by the bacteriologist of the board of health  if the
bacillus lepræ is found the patient is examined by the board of
examining physicians five in number  if found by them to be a leper he
is so declared which finding is later officially confirmed by the board
of health and the leper is ordered straight to molokai  furthermore
during the thorough trial that is given his case the patient has the
right to be represented by a physician whom he can select and employ for
himself  nor after having been declared a leper is the patient
immediately rushed off to molokai  he is given ample time weeks and
even months sometimes during which he stays at kalihi and winds up or
arranges all his business affairs  at molokai in turn he may be
visited by his relatives business agents etc though they are not
permitted to eat and sleep in his house  visitors houses kept “clean”
are maintained for this purpose

i saw an illustration of the thorough trial given the suspect when i
visited kalihi with mr pinkham president of the board of health  the
suspect was an hawaiian seventy years of age who for thirty-four years
had worked in honolulu as a pressman in a printing office  the
bacteriologist had decided that he was a leper the examining board had
been unable to make up its mind and that day all had come out to kalihi
to make another examination

when at molokai the declared leper has the privilege of re-examination
and patients are continually coming back to honolulu for that purpose
the steamer that took me to molokai had on board two returning lepers
both young women one of whom had come to honolulu to settle up some
property she owned and the other had come to honolulu to see her sick
mother  both had remained at kalihi for a month

the settlement of molokai enjoys a far more delightful climate than even
honolulu being situated on the windward side of the island in the path
of the fresh north-east trades  the scenery is magnificent on one side
is the blue sea on the other the wonderful wall of the pali receding
here and there into beautiful mountain valleys  everywhere are grassy
pastures over which roam the hundreds of horses which are owned by the
lepers  some of them have their own carts rigs and traps  in the
little harbour of kalaupapa lie fishing boats and a steam launch all of
which are privately owned and operated by lepers  their bounds upon the
sea are of course determined otherwise no restriction is put upon
their sea-faring  their fish they sell to the board of health and the
money they receive is their own  while i was there one nights catch
was four thousand pounds

and as these men fish others farm  all trades are followed  one leper
a pure hawaiian is the boss painter  he employs eight men and takes
contracts for painting buildings from the board of health  he is a
member of the kalaupapa rifle club where i met him and i must confess
that he was far better dressed than i  another man similarly situated
is the boss carpenter  then in addition to the board of health store
there are little privately owned stores where those with shopkeepers
souls may exercise their peculiar instincts  the assistant
superintendent mr waiamau a finely educated and able man is a pure
hawaiian and a leper  mr bartlett who is the present storekeeper is
an american who was in business in honolulu before he was struck down by
the disease  all that these men earn is that much in their own pockets
if they do not work they are taken care of anyway by the territory
given food shelter clothes and medical attendance  the board of
health carries on agriculture stock-raising and dairying for local
use and employment at fair wages is furnished to all that wish to work
they are not compelled to work however for they are the wards of the
territory  for the young and the very old and the helpless there are
homes and hospitals

major lee an american and long a marine engineer for the inter island
steamship company i met actively at work in the new steam laundry where
he was busy installing the machinery  i met him often afterwards and
one day he said to me

“give us a good breeze about how we live here  for heavens sake write
us up straight  put your foot down on this chamber-of-horrors rot and
all the rest of it  we dont like being misrepresented  weve got some
feelings  just tell the world how we really are in here”

man after man that i met in the settlement and woman after woman in one
way or another expressed the same sentiment  it was patent that they
resented bitterly the sensational and untruthful way in which they have
been exploited in the past

in spite of the fact that they are afflicted by disease the lepers form
a happy colony divided into two villages and numerous country and
seaside homes of nearly a thousand souls  they have six churches a
young mens christian association building several assembly halls a
band stand a race-track baseball grounds shooting ranges an athletic
club numerous glee clubs and two brass bands

“they are so contented down there” mr pinkham told me “that you cant
drive them away with a shot-gun”

this i later verified for myself  in january of this year eleven of the
lepers on whom the disease after having committed certain ravages
showed no further signs of activity were brought back to honolulu for
re-examination  they were loath to come and on being asked whether or
not they wanted to go free if found clean of leprosy one and all
answered “back to molokai”

in the old days before the discovery of the leprosy bacillus a small
number of men and women suffering from various and wholly different
diseases were adjudged lepers and sent to molokai  years afterward they
suffered great consternation when the bacteriologists declared that they
were not afflicted with leprosy and never had been  they fought against
being sent away from molokai and in one way or another as helpers and
nurses they got jobs from the board of health and remained  the present
jailer is one of these men  declared to be a non-leper he accepted on
salary the charge of the jail in order to escape being sent away

at the present moment in honolulu there is a bootblack  he is an
american negro  mr mcveigh told me about him  long ago before the
bacteriological tests he was sent to molokai as a leper  as a ward of
the state he developed a superlative degree of independence and fomented
much petty mischief  and then one day after having been for years a
perennial source of minor annoyances the bacteriological test was
applied and he was declared a non-leper

“ah ha” chortled mr mcveigh  “now ive got you  out you go on the
next steamer and good riddance”

but the negro didnt want to go  immediately he married an old woman in
the last stages of leprosy and began petitioning the board of health for
permission to remain and nurse his sick wife  there was no one he said
pathetically who could take care of his poor wife as well as he could
but they saw through his game and he was deported on the steamer and
given the freedom of the world  but he preferred molokai  landing on
the leeward side of molokai he sneaked down the pali one night and
took up his abode in the settlement  he was apprehended tried and
convicted of trespass sentenced to pay a small fine and again deported
on the steamer with the warning that if he trespassed again he would be
fined one hundred dollars and be sent to prison in honolulu  and now
when mr mcveigh comes up to honolulu the bootblack shines his shoes for
him and says

“say boss i lost a good home down there  yes sir i lost a good
home”  then his voice sinks to a confidential whisper as he says “say
boss cant i go back?  cant you fix it for me so as i can go back?”

he had lived nine years on molokai and he had had a better time there
than he has ever had before and after on the outside

as regards the fear of leprosy itself nowhere in the settlement among
lepers or non-lepers did i see any sign of it  the chief horror of
leprosy obtains in the minds of those who have never seen a leper and who
do not know anything about the disease  at the hotel at waikiki a lady
expressed shuddering amazement at my having the hardihood to pay a visit
to the settlement  on talking with her i learned that she had been born
in honolulu had lived there all her life and had never laid eyes on a
leper  that was more than i could say of myself in the united states
where the segregation of lepers is loosely enforced and where i have
repeatedly seen lepers on the streets of large cities

leprosy is terrible there is no getting away from that but from what
little i know of the disease and its degree of contagiousness i would by
far prefer to spend the rest of my days in molokai than in any
tuberculosis sanatorium  in every city and county hospital for poor
people in the united states or in similar institutions in other
countries sights as terrible as those in molokai can be witnessed and
the sum total of these sights is vastly more terrible  for that matter
if it were given me to choose between being compelled to live in molokai
for the rest of my life or in the east end of london the east side of
new york or the stockyards of chicago i would select molokai without
debate  i would prefer one year of life in molokai to five years of life
in the above-mentioned cesspools of human degradation and misery

in molokai the people are happy  i shall never forget the celebration of
the fourth of july i witnessed there  at six oclock in the morning the
“horribles” were out dressed fantastically astride horses mules and
donkeys (their own property) and cutting capers all over the settlement
two brass bands were out as well  then there were the pa-u riders
thirty or forty of them hawaiian women all superb horsewomen dressed
gorgeously in the old native riding costume and dashing about in twos
and threes and groups  in the afternoon charmian and i stood in the
judges stand and awarded the prizes for horsemanship and costume to the
pa-u riders  all about were the hundreds of lepers with wreaths of
flowers on heads and necks and shoulders looking on and making merry
and always over the brows of hills and across the grassy level
stretches appearing and disappearing were the groups of men and women
gaily dressed on galloping horses horses and riders flower-bedecked and
flower-garlanded singing and laughing and riding like the wind  and
as i stood in the judges stand and looked at all this there came to my
recollection the lazar house of havana where i had once beheld some two
hundred lepers prisoners inside four restricted walls until they died
no there are a few thousand places i wot of in this world over which i
would select molokai as a place of permanent residence  in the evening
we went to one of the leper assembly halls where before a crowded
audience the singing societies contested for prizes and where the night
wound up with a dance  i have seen the hawaiians living in the slums of
honolulu and having seen them i can readily understand why the lepers
brought up from the settlement for re-examination shouted one and all
“back to molokai”

one thing is certain  the leper in the settlement is far better off than
the leper who lies in hiding outside  such a leper is a lonely outcast
living in constant fear of discovery and slowly and surely rotting away
the action of leprosy is not steady  it lays hold of its victim commits
a ravage and then lies dormant for an indeterminate period  it may not
commit another ravage for five years or ten years or forty years and
the patient may enjoy uninterrupted good health  rarely however do
these first ravages cease of themselves  the skilled surgeon is
required and the skilled surgeon cannot be called in for the leper who
is in hiding  for instance the first ravage may take the form of a
perforating ulcer in the sole of the foot  when the bone is reached
necrosis sets in  if the leper is in hiding he cannot be operated upon
the necrosis will continue to eat its way up the bone of the leg and in
a brief and horrible time that leper will die of gangrene or some other
terrible complication  on the other hand if that same leper is in
molokai the surgeon will operate upon the foot remove the ulcer
cleanse the bone and put a complete stop to that particular ravage of
the disease  a month after the operation the leper will be out riding
horseback running foot races swimming in the breakers or climbing the
giddy sides of the valleys for mountain apples  and as has been stated
before the disease lying dormant may not again attack him for five
ten or forty years

the old horrors of leprosy go back to the conditions that obtained before
the days of antiseptic surgery and before the time when physicians like
dr goodhue and dr hollmann went to live at the settlement  dr goodhue
is the pioneer surgeon there and too much praise cannot be given him for
the noble work he has done  i spent one morning in the operating room
with him and of the three operations he performed two were on men
newcomers who had arrived on the same steamer with me  in each case
the disease had attacked in one spot only  one had a perforating ulcer
in the ankle well advanced and the other man was suffering from a
similar affliction well advanced under his arm  both cases were well
advanced because the man had been on the outside and had not been
treated  in each case  dr goodhue put an immediate and complete stop
to the ravage and in four weeks those two men will be as well and
able-bodied as they ever were in their lives  the only difference
between them and you or me is that the disease is lying dormant in their
bodies and may at any future time commit another ravage

leprosy is as old as history  references to it are found in the earliest
written records  and yet to-day practically nothing more is known about
it than was known then  this much was known then namely that it was
contagious and that those afflicted by it should be segregated  the
difference between then and now is that to-day the leper is more rigidly
segregated and more humanely treated  but leprosy itself still remains
the same awful and profound mystery  a reading of the reports of the
physicians and specialists of all countries reveals the baffling nature
of the disease  these leprosy specialists are unanimous on no one phase
of the disease  they do not know  in the past they rashly and
dogmatically generalized  they generalize no longer  the one possible
generalization that can be drawn from all the investigation that has been
made is that leprosy is feebly contagious  but in what manner it is
feebly contagious is not known  they have isolated the bacillus of
leprosy  they can determine by bacteriological examination whether or
not a person is a leper but they are as far away as ever from knowing
how that bacillus finds its entrance into the body of a non-leper  they
do not know the length of time of incubation  they have tried to
inoculate all sorts of animals with leprosy and have failed

they are baffled in the discovery of a serum wherewith to fight the
disease  and in all their work as yet they have found no clue no
cure  sometimes there have been blazes of hope theories of causation
and much heralded cures but every time the darkness of failure quenched
the flame  a doctor insists that the cause of leprosy is a
long-continued fish diet and he proves his theory voluminously till a
physician from the highlands of india demands why the natives of that
district should therefore be afflicted by leprosy when they have never
eaten fish nor all the generations of their fathers before them  a man
treats a leper with a certain kind of oil or drug announces a cure and
five ten or forty years afterwards the disease breaks out again  it is
this trick of leprosy lying dormant in the body for indeterminate periods
that is responsible for many alleged cures  but this much is certain
as yet there has been no authentic case of a cure

leprosy is feebly contagious but how is it contagious?  an austrian
physician has inoculated himself and his assistants with leprosy and
failed to catch it  but this is not conclusive for there is the famous
case of the hawaiian murderer who had his sentence of death commuted to
life imprisonment on his agreeing to be inoculated with the bacillus
lepræ  some time after inoculation leprosy made its appearance and
the man died a leper on molokai  nor was this conclusive for it was
discovered that at the time he was inoculated several members of his
family were already suffering from the disease on molokai  he may have
contracted the disease from them and it may have been well along in its
mysterious period of incubation at the time he was officially inoculated
then there is the case of that hero of the church father damien who
went to molokai a clean man and died a leper  there have been many
theories as to how he contracted leprosy but nobody knows  he never
knew himself  but every chance that he ran has certainly been run by a
woman at present living in the settlement who has lived there many
years who has had five leper husbands and had children by them and who
is to-day as she always has been free of the disease

as yet no light has been shed upon the mystery of leprosy  when more is
learned about the disease a cure for it may be expected  once an
efficacious serum is discovered and leprosy because it is so feebly
contagious will pass away swiftly from the earth  the battle waged with
it will be short and sharp  in the meantime how to discover that serum
or some other unguessed weapon?  in the present it is a serious matter
it is estimated that there are half a million lepers not segregated in
india alone  carnegie libraries rockefeller universities and many
similar benefactions are all very well but one cannot help thinking how
far a few thousands of dollars would go say in the leper settlement of
molokai  the residents there are accidents of fate scapegoats to some
mysterious natural law of which man knows nothing isolated for the
welfare of their fellows who else might catch the dread disease even as
they have caught it nobody knows how  not for their sakes merely but
for the sake of future generations a few thousands of dollars would go
far in a legitimate and scientific search after a cure for leprosy for a
serum or for some undreamed discovery that will enable the medical world
to exterminate the bacillus lepræ  theres the place for your money

chapter viii
the house of the sun


there are hosts of people who journey like restless spirits round and
about this earth in search of seascapes and landscapes and the wonders
and beauties of nature  they overrun europe in armies they can be met
in droves and herds in florida and the west indies at the pyramids and
on the slopes and summits of the canadian and american rockies but in
the house of the sun they are as rare as live and wriggling dinosaurs
haleakala is the hawaiian name for “the house of the sun”  it is a noble
dwelling situated on the island of maui but so few tourists have ever
peeped into it much less entered it that their number may be
practically reckoned as zero  yet i venture to state that for natural
beauty and wonder the nature-lover may see dissimilar things as great as
haleakala but no greater while he will never see elsewhere anything
more beautiful or wonderful  honolulu is six days steaming from san
francisco maui is a nights run on the steamer from honolulu and six
hours more if he is in a hurry can bring the traveller to kolikoli
which is ten thousand and thirty-two feet above the sea and which stands
hard by the entrance portal to the house of the sun  yet the tourist
comes not and haleakala sleeps on in lonely and unseen grandeur

not being tourists we of the snark went to haleakala  on the slopes
of that monster mountain there is a cattle ranch of some fifty thousand
acres where we spent the night at an altitude of two thousand feet  the
next morning it was boots and saddles and with cow-boys and packhorses
we climbed to ukulele a mountain ranch-house the altitude of which
fifty-five hundred feet gives a severely temperate climate compelling
blankets at night and a roaring fireplace in the living-room  ukulele
by the way is the hawaiian for “jumping flea” as it is also the hawaiian
for a certain musical instrument that may be likened to a young guitar
it is my opinion that the mountain ranch-house was named after the young
guitar  we were not in a hurry and we spent the day at ukulele
learnedly discussing altitudes and barometers and shaking our particular
barometer whenever any ones argument stood in need of demonstration
our barometer was the most graciously acquiescent instrument i have ever
seen  also we gathered mountain raspberries large as hens eggs and
larger gazed up the pasture-covered lava slopes to the summit of
haleakala forty-five hundred feet above us and looked down upon a
mighty battle of the clouds that was being fought beneath us ourselves
in the bright sunshine

every day and every day this unending battle goes on  ukiukiu is the
name of the trade-wind that comes raging down out of the north-east and
hurls itself upon haleakala  now haleakala is so bulky and tall that it
turns the north-east trade-wind aside on either hand so that in the lee
of haleakala no trade-wind blows at all  on the contrary the wind blows
in the counter direction in the teeth of the north-east trade  this
wind is called naulu  and day and night and always ukiukiu and naulu
strive with each other advancing retreating flanking curving
curling and turning and twisting the conflict made visible by the
cloud-masses plucked from the heavens and hurled back and forth in
squadrons battalions armies and great mountain ranges  once in a
while ukiukiu in mighty gusts flings immense cloud-masses clear over
the summit of haleakala whereupon naulu craftily captures them lines
them up in new battle-formation and with them smites back at his ancient
and eternal antagonist  then ukiukiu sends a great cloud-army around the
eastern-side of the mountain  it is a flanking movement well executed
but naulu from his lair on the leeward side gathers the flanking army
in pulling and twisting and dragging it hammering it into shape and
sends it charging back against ukiukiu around the western side of the
mountain  and all the while above and below the main battle-field high
up the slopes toward the sea ukiukiu and naulu are continually sending
out little wisps of cloud in ragged skirmish line that creep and crawl
over the ground among the trees and through the canyons and that spring
upon and capture one another in sudden ambuscades and sorties  and
sometimes ukiukiu or naulu abruptly sending out a heavy charging column
captures the ragged little skirmishers or drives them skyward turning
over and over in vertical whirls thousands of feet in the air

but it is on the western slopes of haleakala that the main battle goes
on  here naulu masses his heaviest formations and wins his greatest
victories  ukiukiu grows weak toward late afternoon which is the way of
all trade-winds and is driven backward by naulu  naulus generalship is
excellent  all day he has been gathering and packing away immense
reserves  as the afternoon draws on he welds them into a solid column
sharp-pointed miles in length a mile in width and hundreds of feet
thick  this column he slowly thrusts forward into the broad battle-front
of ukiukiu and slowly and surely ukiukiu weakening fast is split
asunder  but it is not all bloodless  at times ukiukiu struggles
wildly and with fresh accessions of strength from the limitless
north-east smashes away half a mile at a time of naulus column and
sweeps it off and away toward west maui  sometimes when the two
charging armies meet end-on a tremendous perpendicular whirl results
the cloud-masses locked together mounting thousands of feet into the
air and turning over and over  a favourite device of ukiukiu is to send
a low squat formation densely packed forward along the ground and
under naulu  when ukiukiu is under he proceeds to buck  naulus mighty
middle gives to the blow and bends upward but usually he turns the
attacking column back upon itself and sets it milling  and all the while
the ragged little skirmishers stray and detached sneak through the
trees and canyons crawl along and through the grass and surprise one
another with unexpected leaps and rushes while above far above serene
and lonely in the rays of the setting sun haleakala looks down upon the
conflict  and so the night  but in the morning after the fashion of
trade-winds ukiukiu gathers strength and sends the hosts of naulu
rolling back in confusion and rout  and one day is like another day in
the battle of the clouds where ukiukiu and naulu strive eternally on the
slopes of haleakala

again in the morning it was boots and saddles cow-boys and packhorses
and the climb to the top began  one packhorse carried twenty gallons of
water slung in five-gallon bags on either side for water is precious
and rare in the crater itself in spite of the fact that several miles to
the north and east of the crater-rim more rain comes down than in any
other place in the world  the way led upward across countless lava
flows without regard for trails and never have i seen horses with such
perfect footing as that of the thirteen that composed our outfit  they
climbed or dropped down perpendicular places with the sureness and
coolness of mountain goats and never a horse fell or baulked

there is a familiar and strange illusion experienced by all who climb
isolated mountains  the higher one climbs the more of the earths
surface becomes visible and the effect of this is that the horizon seems
up-hill from the observer  this illusion is especially notable on
haleakala for the old volcano rises directly from the sea without
buttresses or connecting ranges  in consequence as fast as we climbed
up the grim slope of haleakala still faster did haleakala ourselves
and all about us sink down into the centre of what appeared a profound
abyss  everywhere far above us towered the horizon  the ocean sloped
down from the horizon to us  the higher we climbed the deeper did we
seem to sink down the farther above us shone the horizon and the
steeper pitched the grade up to that horizontal line where sky and ocean
met  it was weird and unreal and vagrant thoughts of simms hole and of
the volcano through which jules verne journeyed to the centre of the
earth flitted through ones mind

and then when at last we reached the summit of that monster mountain
which summit was like the bottom of an inverted cone situated in the
centre of an awful cosmic pit we found that we were at neither top nor
bottom  far above us was the heaven-towering horizon and far beneath
us where the top of the mountain should have been was a deeper deep
the great crater the house of the sun  twenty-three miles around
stretched the dizzy wells of the crater  we stood on the edge of the
nearly vertical western wall and the floor of the crater lay nearly half
a mile beneath  this floor broken by lava-flows and cinder-cones was
as red and fresh and uneroded as if it were but yesterday that the fires
went out  the cinder-cones the smallest over four hundred feet in
height and the largest over nine hundred seemed no more than puny little
sand-hills so mighty was the magnitude of the setting  two gaps
thousands of feet deep broke the rim of the crater and through these
ukiukiu vainly strove to drive his fleecy herds of trade-wind clouds  as
fast as they advanced through the gaps the heat of the crater dissipated
them into thin air and though they advanced always they got nowhere

it was a scene of vast bleakness and desolation stern forbidding
fascinating  we gazed down upon a place of fire and earthquake  the
tie-ribs of earth lay bare before us  it was a workshop of nature still
cluttered with the raw beginnings of world-making  here and there great
dikes of primordial rock had thrust themselves up from the bowels of
earth straight through the molten surface-ferment that had evidently
cooled only the other day  it was all unreal and unbelievable  looking
upward far above us (in reality beneath us) floated the cloud-battle of
ukiukiu and naulu  and higher up the slope of the seeming abyss above
the cloud-battle in the air and sky hung the islands of lanai and
molokai  across the crater to the south-east still apparently looking
upward we saw ascending first the turquoise sea then the white
surf-line of the shore of hawaii above that the belt of trade-clouds
and next eighty miles away rearing their stupendous hulks out of the
azure sky tipped with snow wreathed with cloud trembling like a
mirage the peaks of mauna kea and mauna loa hung poised on the wall of
heaven

it is told that long ago one maui the son of hina lived on what is now
known as west maui  his mother hina employed her time in the making of
kapas  she must have made them at night for her days were occupied in
trying to dry the kapas  each morning and all morning she toiled at
spreading them out in the sun  but no sooner were they out than she
began taking them in in order to have them all under shelter for the
night  for know that the days were shorter then than now  maui watched
his mothers futile toil and felt sorry for her  he decided to do
something—oh no not to help her hang out and take in the kapas  he
was too clever for that  his idea was to make the sun go slower
perhaps he was the first hawaiian astronomer  at any rate he took a
series of observations of the sun from various parts of the island  his
conclusion was that the suns path was directly across haleakala  unlike
joshua he stood in no need of divine assistance  he gathered a huge
quantity of coconuts from the fibre of which he braided a stout cord
and in one end of which he made a noose even as the cow-boys of
haleakala do to this day  next he climbed into the house of the sun and
laid in wait  when the sun came tearing along the path bent on
completing its journey in the shortest time possible the valiant youth
threw his lariat around one of the suns largest and strongest beams  he
made the sun slow down some also he broke the beam short off  and he
kept on roping and breaking off beams till the sun said it was willing to
listen to reason  maui set forth his terms of peace which the sun
accepted agreeing to go more slowly thereafter  wherefore hina had
ample time in which to dry her kapas and the days are longer than they
used to be which last is quite in accord with the teachings of modern
astronomy

we had a lunch of jerked beef and hard poi in a stone corral used of
old time for the night-impounding of cattle being driven across the
island  then we skirted the rim for half a mile and began the descent
into the crater  twenty-five hundred feet beneath lay the floor and
down a steep slope of loose volcanic cinders we dropped the sure-footed
horses slipping and sliding but always keeping their feet  the black
surface of the cinders when broken by the horses hoofs turned to a
yellow ochre dust virulent in appearance and acid of taste that arose
in clouds  there was a gallop across a level stretch to the mouth of a
convenient blow-hole and then the descent continued in clouds of
volcanic dust winding in and out among cinder-cones brick-red old
rose and purplish black of colour  above us higher and higher towered
the crater-walls while we journeyed on across innumerable lava-flows
turning and twisting a devious way among the adamantine billows of a
petrified sea  saw-toothed waves of lava vexed the surface of this weird
ocean while on either hand arose jagged crests and spiracles of
fantastic shape  our way led on past a bottomless pit and along and over
the main stream of the latest lava-flow for seven miles

at the lower end of the crater was our camping spot in a small grove of
olapa and kolea trees tucked away in a corner of the crater at the
base of walls that rose perpendicularly fifteen hundred feet  here was
pasturage for the horses but no water and first we turned aside and
picked our way across a mile of lava to a known water-hole in a crevice
in the crater-wall  the water-hole was empty  but on climbing fifty
feet up the crevice a pool was found containing half a dozen barrels of
water  a pail was carried up and soon a steady stream of the precious
liquid was running down the rock and filling the lower pool while the
cow-boys below were busy fighting the horses back for there was room for
one only to drink at a time  then it was on to camp at the foot of the
wall up which herds of wild goats scrambled and blatted while the tent
arose to the sound of rifle-firing  jerked beef hard poi and broiled
kid were the menu  over the crest of the crater just above our heads
rolled a sea of clouds driven on by ukiukiu  though this sea rolled
over the crest unceasingly it never blotted out nor dimmed the moon for
the heat of the crater dissolved the clouds as fast as they rolled in
through the moonlight attracted by the camp-fire came the crater cattle
to peer and challenge  they were rolling fat though they rarely drank
water the morning dew on the grass taking its place  it was because of
this dew that the tent made a welcome bedchamber and we fell asleep to
the chanting of hulas by the unwearied hawaiian cow-boys in whose
veins no doubt ran the blood of maui their valiant forebear

the camera cannot do justice to the house of the sun  the sublimated
chemistry of photography may not lie but it certainly does not tell all
the truth  the koolau gap may be faithfully reproduced just as it
impinged on the retina of the camera yet in the resulting picture the
gigantic scale of things would be missing  those walls that seem several
hundred feet in height are almost as many thousand that entering wedge
of cloud is a mile and a half wide in the gap itself while beyond the
gap it is a veritable ocean and that foreground of cinder-cone and
volcanic ash mushy and colourless in appearance is in truth
gorgeous-hued in brick-red terra-cotta rose yellow ochre and purplish
black  also words are a vain thing and drive to despair  to say that a
crater-wall is two thousand feet high is to say just precisely that it is
two thousand feet high but there is a vast deal more to that crater-wall
than a mere statistic  the sun is ninety-three millions of miles
distant but to mortal conception the adjoining county is farther away
this frailty of the human brain is hard on the sun  it is likewise hard
on the house of the sun  haleakala has a message of beauty and wonder
for the human soul that cannot be delivered by proxy  kolikoli is six
hours from kahului kahului is a nights run from honolulu honolulu is
six days from san francisco and there you are

we climbed the crater-walls put the horses over impossible places
rolled stones and shot wild goats  i did not get any goats  i was too
busy rolling stones  one spot in particular i remember where we started
a stone the size of a horse  it began the descent easy enough rolling
over wobbling and threatening to stop but in a few minutes it was
soaring through the air two hundred feet at a jump  it grew rapidly
smaller until it struck a slight slope of volcanic sand over which it
darted like a startled jackrabbit kicking up behind it a tiny trail of
yellow dust  stone and dust diminished in size until some of the party
said the stone had stopped  that was because they could not see it any
longer  it had vanished into the distance beyond their ken  others saw
it rolling farther on—i know i did and it is my firm conviction that
that stone is still rolling

our last day in the crater ukiukiu gave us a taste of his strength  he
smashed naulu back all along the line filled the house of the sun to
overflowing with clouds and drowned us out  our rain-gauge was a pint
cup under a tiny hole in the tent  that last night of storm and rain
filled the cup and there was no way of measuring the water that spilled
over into the blankets  with the rain-gauge out of business there was no
longer any reason for remaining so we broke camp in the wet-gray of
dawn and plunged eastward across the lava to the kaupo gap  east maui
is nothing more or less than the vast lava stream that flowed long ago
through the kaupo gap and down this stream we picked our way from an
altitude of six thousand five hundred feet to the sea  this was a days
work in itself for the horses but never were there such horses  safe in
the bad places never rushing never losing their heads as soon as they
found a trail wide and smooth enough to run on they ran  there was no
stopping them until the trail became bad again and then they stopped of
themselves  continuously for days they had performed the hardest kind
of work and fed most of the time on grass foraged by themselves at night
while we slept and yet that day they covered twenty-eight leg-breaking
miles and galloped into hana like a bunch of colts  also there were
several of them reared in the dry region on the leeward side of
haleakala that had never worn shoes in all their lives  day after day
and all day long unshod they had travelled over the sharp lava with
the extra weight of a man on their backs and their hoofs were in better
condition than those of the shod horses

the scenery between vieirass (where the kaupo gap empties into the sea)
and lana which we covered in half a day is well worth a week or month
but wildly beautiful as it is it becomes pale and small in comparison
with the wonderland that lies beyond the rubber plantations between hana
and the honomanu gulch  two days were required to cover this marvellous
stretch which lies on the windward side of haleakala  the people who
dwell there call it the “ditch country” an unprepossessing name but it
has no other  nobody else ever comes there  nobody else knows anything
about it  with the exception of a handful of men whom business has
brought there nobody has heard of the ditch country of maui  now a
ditch is a ditch assumably muddy and usually traversing uninteresting
and monotonous landscapes  but the nahiku ditch is not an ordinary
ditch  the windward side of haleakala is serried by a thousand
precipitous gorges down which rush as many torrents each torrent of
which achieves a score of cascades and waterfalls before it reaches the
sea  more rain comes down here than in any other region in the world
in 1904 the years downpour was four hundred and twenty inches  water
means sugar and sugar is the backbone of the territory of hawaii
wherefore the nahiku ditch which is not a ditch but a chain of tunnels
the water travels underground appearing only at intervals to leap a
gorge travelling high in the air on a giddy flume and plunging into and
through the opposing mountain  this magnificent waterway is called a
“ditch” and with equal appropriateness can cleopatras barge be called a
box-car

there are no carriage roads through the ditch country and before the
ditch was built or bored rather there was no horse-trail  hundreds of
inches of rain annually on fertile soil under a tropic sun means a
steaming jungle of vegetation  a man on foot cutting his way through
might advance a mile a day but at the end of a week he would be a wreck
and he would have to crawl hastily back if he wanted to get out before
the vegetation overran the passage way he had cut  oshaughnessy was the
daring engineer who conquered the jungle and the gorges ran the ditch
and made the horse-trail  he built enduringly in concrete and masonry
and made one of the most remarkable water-farms in the world  every
little runlet and dribble is harvested and conveyed by subterranean
channels to the main ditch  but so heavily does it rain at times that
countless spillways let the surplus escape to the sea

the horse-trail is not very wide  like the engineer who built it it
dares anything  where the ditch plunges through the mountain it climbs
over and where the ditch leaps a gorge on a flume the horse-trail takes
advantage of the ditch and crosses on top of the flume  that careless
trail thinks nothing of travelling up or down the faces of precipices
it gouges its narrow way out of the wall dodging around waterfalls or
passing under them where they thunder down in white fury while straight
overhead the wall rises hundreds of feet and straight beneath it sinks a
thousand  and those marvellous mountain horses are as unconcerned as the
trail  they fox-trot along it as a matter of course though the footing
is slippery with rain and they will gallop with their hind feet slipping
over the edge if you let them  i advise only those with steady nerves
and cool heads to tackle the nahiku ditch trail  one of our cow-boys was
noted as the strongest and bravest on the big ranch  he had ridden
mountain horses all his life on the rugged western slopes of haleakala
he was first in the horse-breaking and when the others hung back as a
matter of course he would go in to meet a wild bull in the cattle-pen
he had a reputation  but he had never ridden over the nahiku ditch  it
was there he lost his reputation  when he faced the first flume
spanning a hair-raising gorge narrow without railings with a bellowing
waterfall above another below and directly beneath a wild cascade the
air filled with driving spray and rocking to the clamour and rush of
sound and motion—well that cow-boy dismounted from his horse explained
briefly that he had a wife and two children and crossed over on foot
leading the horse behind him

the only relief from the flumes was the precipices and the only relief
from the precipices was the flumes except where the ditch was far under
ground in which case we crossed one horse and rider at a time on
primitive log-bridges that swayed and teetered and threatened to carry
away  i confess that at first i rode such places with my feet loose in
the stirrups and that on the sheer walls i saw to it by a definite
conscious act of will that the foot in the outside stirrup overhanging
the thousand feet of fall was exceedingly loose  i say “at first” for
as in the crater itself we quickly lost our conception of magnitude so
on the nahiku ditch we quickly lost our apprehension of depth  the
ceaseless iteration of height and depth produced a state of consciousness
in which height and depth were accepted as the ordinary conditions of
existence and from the horses back to look sheer down four hundred or
five hundred feet became quite commonplace and non-productive of thrills
and as carelessly as the trail and the horses we swung along the dizzy
heights and ducked around or through the waterfalls

and such a ride  falling water was everywhere  we rode above the
clouds under the clouds and through the clouds and every now and then
a shaft of sunshine penetrated like a search-light to the depths yawning
beneath us or flashed upon some pinnacle of the crater-rim thousands of
feet above  at every turn of the trail a waterfall or a dozen
waterfalls leaping hundreds of feet through the air burst upon our
vision  at our first nights camp in the keanae gulch we counted
thirty-two waterfalls from a single viewpoint  the vegetation ran riot
over that wild land  there were forests of koa and kolea trees and
candlenut trees and then there were the trees called ohia-ai which bore
red mountain apples mellow and juicy and most excellent to eat  wild
bananas grew everywhere clinging to the sides of the gorges and
overborne by their great bunches of ripe fruit falling across the trail
and blocking the way  and over the forest surged a sea of green life
the climbers of a thousand varieties some that floated airily in
lacelike filaments from the tallest branches others that coiled and
wound about the trees like huge serpents and one the ei-ei that was
for all the world like a climbing palm swinging on a thick stem from
branch to branch and tree to tree and throttling the supports whereby it
climbed  through the sea of green lofty tree-ferns thrust their great
delicate fronds and the lehua flaunted its scarlet blossoms  underneath
the climbers in no less profusion grew the warm-coloured
strangely-marked plants that in the united states one is accustomed to
seeing preciously conserved in hot-houses  in fact the ditch country of
maui is nothing more nor less than a huge conservatory  every familiar
variety of fern flourishes and more varieties that are unfamiliar from
the tiniest maidenhair to the gross and voracious staghorn the latter
the terror of the woodsmen interlacing with itself in tangled masses
five or six feet deep and covering acres

never was there such a ride  for two days it lasted when we emerged
into rolling country and along an actual wagon-road came home to the
ranch at a gallop  i know it was cruel to gallop the horses after such a
long hard journey but we blistered our hands in vain effort to hold
them in  thats the sort of horses they grow on haleakala  at the ranch
there was great festival of cattle-driving branding and horse-breaking
overhead ukiukiu and naulu battled valiantly and far above in the
sunshine towered the mighty summit of haleakala




chapter ix
a pacific traverse


sandwich islands to tahiti—there is great difficulty in making this
passage across the trades  the whalers and all others speak with great
doubt of fetching tahiti from the sandwich islands  capt bruce says
that a vessel should keep to the northward until she gets a start of wind
before bearing for her destination  in his passage between them in
november 1837 he had no variables near the line in coming south
and never could make easting on either tack though he endeavoured by
every means to do so

so say the sailing directions for the south pacific ocean and that is
all they say  there is not a word more to help the weary voyager in
making this long traverse—nor is there any word at all concerning the
passage from hawaii to the marquesas which lie some eight hundred miles
to the northeast of tahiti and which are the more difficult to reach by
just that much  the reason for the lack of directions is i imagine
that no voyager is supposed to make himself weary by attempting so
impossible a traverse  but the impossible did not deter the
snark—principally because of the fact that we did not read that
particular little paragraph in the sailing directions until after we had
started  we sailed from hilo hawaii on october 7 and arrived at
nuka-hiva in the marquesas on december 6  the distance was two
thousand miles as the crow flies while we actually travelled at least
four thousand miles to accomplish it thus proving for once and for ever
that the shortest distance between two points is not always a straight
line  had we headed directly for the marquesas we might have travelled
five or six thousand miles

upon one thing we were resolved we would not cross the line west of 130°
west longitude  for here was the problem  to cross the line to the west
of that point if the southeast trades were well around to the southeast
would throw us so far to leeward of the marquesas that a head-beat would
be maddeningly impossible  also we had to remember the equatorial
current which moves west at a rate of anywhere from twelve to
seventy-five miles a day  a pretty pickle indeed to be to leeward of
our destination with such a current in our teeth  no not a minute nor
a second west of 130° west longitude would we cross the line  but since
the southeast trades were to be expected five or six degrees north of the
line (which if they were well around to the southeast or
south-southeast would necessitate our sliding off toward
south-southwest) we should have to hold to the eastward north of the
line and north of the southeast trades until we gained at least 128°
west longitude

i have forgotten to mention that the seventy-horse-power gasolene engine
as usual was not working and that we could depend upon wind alone
neither was the launch engine working  and while i am about it i may as
well confess that the five-horse-power which ran the lights fans and
pumps was also on the sick-list  a striking title for a book haunts me
waking and sleeping  i should like to write that book some day and to
call it “around the world with three gasolene engines and a wife”  but i
am afraid i shall not write it for fear of hurting the feelings of some
of the young gentlemen of san francisco honolulu and hilo who learned
their trades at the expense of the snarks engines

it looked easy on paper  here was hilo and there was our objective 128°
west longitude  with the northeast trade blowing we could travel a
straight line between the two points and even slack our sheets off a
goodly bit  but one of the chief troubles with the trades is that one
never knows just where he will pick them up and just in what direction
they will be blowing  we picked up the northeast trade right outside of
hilo harbour but the miserable breeze was away around into the east
then there was the north equatorial current setting westward like a
mighty river  furthermore a small boat by the wind and bucking into a
big headsea does not work to advantage  she jogs up and down and gets
nowhere  her sails are full and straining every little while she
presses her lee-rail under she flounders and bumps and splashes and
that is all  whenever she begins to gather way she runs ker-chug into a
big mountain of water and is brought to a standstill  so with the
snark the resultant of her smallness of the trade around into the
east and of the strong equatorial current was a long sag south  oh
she did not go quite south  but the easting she made was distressing
on october 11 she made forty miles easting october 12 fifteen miles
october 13 no easting october 14 thirty miles october 15
twenty-three miles october 16 eleven miles and on october 17 she
actually went to the westward four miles  thus in a week she made one
hundred and fifteen miles easting which was equivalent to sixteen miles
a day  but between the longitude of hilo and 128° west longitude is a
difference of twenty-seven degrees or roughly sixteen hundred miles
at sixteen miles a day one hundred days would be required to accomplish
this distance  and even then our objective 128° west longitude was
five degrees north of the line while nuka-hiva in the marquesas lay
nine degrees south of the line and twelve degrees to the west

there remained only one thing to do—to work south out of the trade and
into the variables  it is true that captain bruce found no variables on
his traverse and that he “never could make easting on either tack”  it
was the variables or nothing with us and we prayed for better luck than
he had had  the variables constitute the belt of ocean lying between the
trades and the doldrums and are conjectured to be the draughts of heated
air which rise in the doldrums flow high in the air counter to the
trades and gradually sink down till they fan the surface of the ocean
where they are found  and they are found where they are found for they
are wedged between the trades and the doldrums which same shift their
territory from day to day and month to month

we found the variables in 11° north latitude and 11° north latitude we
hugged jealously  to the south lay the doldrums  to the north lay the
northeast trade that refused to blow from the northeast  the days came
and went and always they found the snark somewhere near the eleventh
parallel  the variables were truly variable  a light head-wind would
die away and leave us rolling in a calm for forty-eight hours  then a
light head-wind would spring up blow for three hours and leave us
rolling in another calm for forty-eight hours  then—hurrah—the wind
would come out of the west fresh beautifully fresh and send the
snark along wing and wing her wake bubbling the log-line straight
astern  at the end of half an hour while we were preparing to set the
spinnaker with a few sickly gasps the wind would die away  and so it
went  we wagered optimistically on every favourable fan of air that
lasted over five minutes but it never did any good  the fans faded out
just the same

but there were exceptions  in the variables if you wait long enough
something is bound to happen and we were so plentifully stocked with
food and water that we could afford to wait  on october 26 we actually
made one hundred and three miles of easting and we talked about it for
days afterwards  once we caught a moderate gale from the south which
blew itself out in eight hours but it helped us to seventy-one miles of
easting in that particular twenty-four hours  and then just as it was
expiring the wind came straight out from the north (the directly
opposite quarter) and fanned us along over another degree of easting

in years and years no sailing vessel has attempted this traverse and we
found ourselves in the midst of one of the loneliest of the pacific
solitudes  in the sixty days we were crossing it we sighted no sail
lifted no steamers smoke above the horizon  a disabled vessel could
drift in this deserted expanse for a dozen generations and there would
be no rescue  the only chance of rescue would be from a vessel like the
snark and the snark happened to be there principally because of the
fact that the traverse had been begun before the particular paragraph in
the sailing directions had been read  standing upright on deck a
straight line drawn from the eye to the horizon would measure three miles
and a half  thus seven miles was the diameter of the circle of the sea
in which we had our centre  since we remained always in the centre and
since we constantly were moving in some direction we looked upon many
circles  but all circles looked alike  no tufted islets gray
headlands nor glistening patches of white canvas ever marred the
symmetry of that unbroken curve  clouds came and went rising up over
the rim of the circle flowing across the space of it and spilling away
and down across the opposite rim

the world faded as the procession of the weeks marched by  the world
faded until at last there ceased to be any world except the little world
of the snark freighted with her seven souls and floating on the
expanse of the waters  our memories of the world the great world
became like dreams of former lives we had lived somewhere before we came
to be born on the snark  after we had been out of fresh vegetables for
some time we mentioned such things in much the same way i have heard my
father mention the vanished apples of his boyhood  man is a creature of
habit and we on the snark had got the habit of the snark
everything about her and aboard her was as a matter of course and
anything different would have been an irritation and an offence

there was no way by which the great world could intrude  our bell rang
the hours but no caller ever rang it  there were no guests to dinner
no telegrams no insistent telephone jangles invading our privacy  we
had no engagements to keep no trains to catch and there were no morning
newspapers over which to waste time in learning what was happening to our
fifteen hundred million other fellow-creatures

but it was not dull  the affairs of our little world had to be
regulated and unlike the great world our world had to be steered in
its journey through space  also there were cosmic disturbances to be
encountered and baffled such as do not afflict the big earth in its
frictionless orbit through the windless void  and we never knew from
moment to moment what was going to happen next  there were spice and
variety enough and to spare  thus at four in the morning i relieve
hermann at the wheel

“east-northeast” he gives me the course  “shes eight points off but
she aint steering”

small wonder  the vessel does not exist that can be steered in so
absolute a calm

“i had a breeze a little while ago—maybe it will come back again”
hermann says hopefully ere he starts forward to the cabin and his bunk

the mizzen is in and fast furled  in the night what of the roll and the
absence of wind it had made life too hideous to be permitted to go on
rasping at the mast smashing at the tackles and buffeting the empty air
into hollow outbursts of sound  but the big mainsail is still on and
the staysail jib and flying-jib are snapping and slashing at their
sheets with every roll  every star is out  just for luck i put the
wheel hard over in the opposite direction to which it had been left by
hermann and i lean back and gaze up at the stars  there is nothing else
for me to do  there is nothing to be done with a sailing vessel rolling
in a stark calm

then i feel a fan on my cheek faint so faint that i can just sense it
ere it is gone  but another comes and another until a real and just
perceptible breeze is blowing  how the snarks sails manage to feel it
is beyond me but feel it they do as she does as well for the compass
card begins slowly to revolve in the binnacle  in reality it is not
revolving at all  it is held by terrestrial magnetism in one place and
it is the snark that is revolving pivoted upon that delicate cardboard
device that floats in a closed vessel of alcohol

so the snark comes back on her course  the breath increases to a tiny
puff  the snark feels the weight of it and actually heels over a
trifle  there is flying scud overhead and i notice the stars being
blotted out  walls of darkness close in upon me so that when the last
star is gone the darkness is so near that it seems i can reach out and
touch it on every side  when i lean toward it i can feel it loom
against my face  puff follows puff and i am glad the mizzen is furled
phew that was a stiff one  the snark goes over and down until her
lee-rail is buried and the whole pacific ocean is pouring in  four or
five of these gusts make me wish that the jib and flying-jib were in
the sea is picking up the gusts are growing stronger and more frequent
and there is a splatter of wet in the air  there is no use in attempting
to gaze to windward  the wall of blackness is within arms length  yet
i cannot help attempting to see and gauge the blows that are being struck
at the snark  there is something ominous and menacing up there to
windward and i have a feeling that if i look long enough and strong
enough i shall divine it  futile feeling  between two gusts i leave
the wheel and run forward to the cabin companionway where i light
matches and consult the barometer  “29-90” it reads  that sensitive
instrument refuses to take notice of the disturbance which is humming
with a deep throaty voice in the rigging  i get back to the wheel just
in time to meet another gust the strongest yet  well anyway the wind
is abeam and the snark is on her course eating up easting  that at
least is well

the jib and flying-jib bother me and i wish they were in  she would
make easier weather of it and less risky weather likewise  the wind
snorts and stray raindrops pelt like birdshot  i shall certainly have
to call all hands i conclude then conclude the next instant to hang on
a little longer  maybe this is the end of it and i shall have called
them for nothing  it is better to let them sleep  i hold the snark
down to her task and from out of the darkness at right angles comes a
deluge of rain accompanied by shrieking wind  then everything eases
except the blackness and i rejoice in that i have not called the men

no sooner does the wind ease than the sea picks up  the combers are
breaking now and the boat is tossing like a cork  then out of the
blackness the gusts come harder and faster than before  if only i knew
what was up there to windward in the blackness  the snark is making
heavy weather of it and her lee-rail is buried oftener than not  more
shrieks and snorts of wind  now if ever is the time to call the men
i will call them i resolve  then there is a burst of rain a
slackening of the wind and i do not call  but it is rather lonely
there at the wheel steering a little world through howling blackness
it is quite a responsibility to be all alone on the surface of a little
world in time of stress doing the thinking for its sleeping inhabitants
i recoil from the responsibility as more gusts begin to strike and as a
sea licks along the weather rail and splashes over into the cockpit  the
salt water seems strangely warm to my body and is shot through with
ghostly nodules of phosphorescent light  i shall surely call all hands
to shorten sail  why should they sleep?  i am a fool to have any
compunctions in the matter  my intellect is arrayed against my heart
it was my heart that said “let them sleep”  yes but it was my
intellect that backed up my heart in that judgment  let my intellect
then reverse the judgment and while i am speculating as to what
particular entity issued that command to my intellect the gusts die
away  solicitude for mere bodily comfort has no place in practical
seamanship i conclude sagely but study the feel of the next series of
gusts and do not call the men  after all it is my intellect behind
everything procrastinating measuring its knowledge of what the snark
can endure against the blows being struck at her and waiting the call of
all hands against the striking of still severer blows

daylight gray and violent steals through the cloud-pall and shows a
foaming sea that flattens under the weight of recurrent and increasing
squalls  then comes the rain filling the windy valleys of the sea with
milky smoke and further flattening the waves which but wait for the
easement of wind and rain to leap more wildly than before  come the men
on deck their sleep out and among them hermann his face on the broad
grin in appreciation of the breeze of wind i have picked up  i turn the
wheel over to warren and start to go below pausing on the way to rescue
the galley stovepipe which has gone adrift  i am barefooted and my toes
have had an excellent education in the art of clinging but as the rail
buries itself in a green sea i suddenly sit down on the streaming deck
hermann good-naturedly elects to question my selection of such a spot
then comes the next roll and he sits down suddenly and without
premeditation  the snark heels over and down the rail takes it green
and hermann and i clutching the precious stove-pipe are swept down into
the lee-scuppers  after that i finish my journey below and while
changing my clothes grin with satisfaction—the snark is making easting

no it is not all monotony  when we had worried along our easting to
126° west longitude we left the variables and headed south through the
doldrums where was much calm weather and where taking advantage of
every fan of air we were often glad to make a score of miles in as many
hours  and yet on such a day we might pass through a dozen squalls and
be surrounded by dozens more  and every squall was to be regarded as a
bludgeon capable of crushing the snark  we were struck sometimes by
the centres and sometimes by the sides of these squalls and we never
knew just where or how we were to be hit  the squall that rose up
covering half the heavens and swept down upon us as likely as not split
into two squalls which passed us harmlessly on either side while the
tiny innocent looking squall that appeared to carry no more than a
hogshead of water and a pound of wind would abruptly assume cyclopean
proportions deluging us with rain and overwhelming us with wind  then
there were treacherous squalls that went boldly astern and sneaked back
upon us from a mile to leeward  again two squalls would tear along one
on each side of us and we would get a fillip from each of them  now a
gale certainly grows tiresome after a few hours but squalls never  the
thousandth squall in ones experience is as interesting as the first one
and perhaps a bit more so  it is the tyro who has no apprehension of
them  the man of a thousand squalls respects a squall  he knows what
they are

it was in the doldrums that our most exciting event occurred  on
november 20 we discovered that through an accident we had lost over
one-half of the supply of fresh water that remained to us  since we were
at that time forty-three days out from hilo our supply of fresh water
was not large  to lose over half of it was a catastrophe  on close
allowance the remnant of water we possessed would last twenty days  but
we were in the doldrums there was no telling where the southeast trades
were nor where we would pick them up

the handcuffs were promptly put upon the pump and once a day the water
was portioned out  each of us received a quart for personal use and
eight quarts were given to the cook  enters now the psychology of the
situation  no sooner had the discovery of the water shortage been made
than i for one was afflicted with a burning thirst  it seemed to me
that i had never been so thirsty in my life  my little quart of water i
could easily have drunk in one draught and to refrain from doing so
required a severe exertion of will  nor was i alone in this  all of us
talked water thought water and dreamed water when we slept  we
examined the charts for possible islands to which to run in extremity
but there were no such islands  the marquesas were the nearest and they
were the other side of the line and of the doldrums too which made it
even worse  we were in 3° north latitude while the marquesas were 9°
south latitude—a difference of over a thousand miles  furthermore the
marquesas lay some fourteen degrees to the west of our longitude  a
pretty pickle for a handful of creatures sweltering on the ocean in the
heat of tropic calms

we rigged lines on either side between the main and mizzen riggings  to
these we laced the big deck awning hoisting it up aft with a sailing
pennant so that any rain it might collect would run forward where it
could be caught  here and there squalls passed across the circle of the
sea  all day we watched them now to port or starboard and again ahead
or astern  but never one came near enough to wet us  in the afternoon a
big one bore down upon us  it spread out across the ocean as it
approached and we could see it emptying countless thousands of gallons
into the salt sea  extra attention was paid to the awning and then we
waited  warren martin and hermann made a vivid picture  grouped
together holding on to the rigging swaying to the roll they were
gazing intently at the squall  strain anxiety and yearning were in
every posture of their bodies  beside them was the dry and empty awning
but they seemed to grow limp and to droop as the squall broke in half
one part passing on ahead the other drawing astern and going to leeward

but that night came rain  martin whose psychological thirst had
compelled him to drink his quart of water early got his mouth down to
the lip of the awning and drank the deepest draught i ever have seen
drunk  the precious water came down in bucketfuls and tubfuls and in
two hours we caught and stored away in the tanks one hundred and twenty
gallons  strange to say in all the rest of our voyage to the marquesas
not another drop of rain fell on board  if that squall had missed us
the handcuffs would have remained on the pump and we would have busied
ourselves with utilizing our surplus gasolene for distillation purposes

then there was the fishing  one did not have to go in search of it for
it was there at the rail  a three-inch steel hook on the end of a stout
line with a piece of white rag for bait was all that was necessary to
catch bonitas weighing from ten to twenty-five pounds  bonitas feed on
flying-fish wherefore they are unaccustomed to nibbling at the hook
they strike as gamely as the gamest fish in the sea and their first run
is something that no man who has ever caught them will forget  also
bonitas are the veriest cannibals  the instant one is hooked he is
attacked by his fellows  often and often we hauled them on board with
fresh clean-bitten holes in them the size of teacups

one school of bonitas numbering many thousands stayed with us day and
night for more than three weeks  aided by the snark it was great
hunting for they cut a swath of destruction through the ocean half a
mile wide and fifteen hundred miles in length  they ranged along abreast
of the snark on either side pouncing upon the flying-fish her forefoot
scared up  since they were continually pursuing astern the flying-fish
that survived for several flights they were always overtaking the
snark and at any time one could glance astern and on the front of a
breaking wave see scores of their silvery forms coasting down just under
the surface  when they had eaten their fill it was their delight to get
in the shadow of the boat or of her sails and a hundred or so were
always to be seen lazily sliding along and keeping cool

but the poor flying-fish  pursued and eaten alive by the bonitas and
dolphins they sought flight in the air where the swooping seabirds
drove them back into the water  under heaven there was no refuge for
them  flying-fish do not play when they essay the air  it is a
life-and-death affair with them  a thousand times a day we could lift
our eyes and see the tragedy played out  the swift broken circling of a
guny might attract ones attention  a glance beneath shows the back of a
dolphin breaking the surface in a wild rush  just in front of its nose a
shimmering palpitant streak of silver shoots from the water into the
air—a delicate organic mechanism of flight endowed with sensation
power of direction and love of life  the guny swoops for it and misses
and the flying-fish gaining its altitude by rising kite-like against
the wind turns in a half-circle and skims off to leeward gliding on the
bosom of the wind  beneath it the wake of the dolphin shows in churning
foam  so he follows gazing upward with large eyes at the flashing
breakfast that navigates an element other than his own  he cannot rise
to so lofty occasion but he is a thorough-going empiricist and he
knows sooner or later if not gobbled up by the guny that the
flying-fish must return to the water  and then—breakfast  we used to
pity the poor winged fish  it was sad to see such sordid and bloody
slaughter  and then in the night watches when a forlorn little
flying-fish struck the mainsail and fell gasping and splattering on the
deck we would rush for it just as eagerly just as greedily just as
voraciously as the dolphins and bonitas  for know that flying-fish are
most toothsome for breakfast  it is always a wonder to me that such
dainty meat does not build dainty tissue in the bodies of the devourers
perhaps the dolphins and bonitas are coarser-fibred because of the high
speed at which they drive their bodies in order to catch their prey  but
then again the flying-fish drive their bodies at high speed too

sharks we caught occasionally on large hooks with chain-swivels bent
on a length of small rope  and sharks meant pilot-fish and remoras and
various sorts of parasitic creatures  regular man-eaters some of the
sharks proved tiger-eyed and with twelve rows of teeth razor-sharp  by
the way we of the snark are agreed that we have eaten many fish that
will not compare with baked shark smothered in tomato dressing  in the
calms we occasionally caught a fish called “haké” by the japanese cook
and once on a spoon-hook trolling a hundred yards astern we caught a
snake-like fish over three feet in length and not more than three inches
in diameter with four fangs in his jaw  he proved the most delicious
fish—delicious in meat and flavour—that we have ever eaten on board

the most welcome addition to our larder was a green sea-turtle weighing
a full hundred pounds and appearing on the table most appetizingly in
steaks soups and stews and finally in a wonderful curry which tempted
all hands into eating more rice than was good for them  the turtle was
sighted to windward calmly sleeping on the surface in the midst of a
huge school of curious dolphins  it was a deep-sea turtle of a surety
for the nearest land was a thousand miles away  we put the snark about
and went back for him hermann driving the granes into his head and neck
when hauled aboard numerous remora were clinging to his shell and out
of the hollows at the roots of his flippers crawled several large crabs
it did not take the crew of the snark longer than the next meal to
reach the unanimous conclusion that it would willingly put the snark
about any time for a turtle

but it is the dolphin that is the king of deep-sea fishes  never is his
colour twice quite the same  swimming in the sea an ethereal creature
of palest azure he displays in that one guise a miracle of colour  but
it is nothing compared with the displays of which he is capable  at one
time he will appear green—pale green deep green phosphorescent green
at another time blue—deep blue electric blue all the spectrum of blue
catch him on a hook and he turns to gold yellow gold all gold  haul
him on deck and he excels the spectrum passing through inconceivable
shades of blues greens and yellows and then suddenly turning a
ghostly white in the midst of which are bright blue spots and you
suddenly discover that he is speckled like a trout  then back from white
he goes through all the range of colours finally turning to a
mother-of-pearl

for those who are devoted to fishing i can recommend no finer sport than
catching dolphin  of course it must be done on a thin line with reel
and pole  a no 7 oshaughnessy tarpon hook is just the thing baited
with an entire flying-fish  like the bonita the dolphins fare consists
of flying-fish and he strikes like lightning at the bait  the first
warning is when the reel screeches and you see the line smoking out at
right angles to the boat  before you have time to entertain anxiety
concerning the length of your line the fish rises into the air in a
succession of leaps  since he is quite certain to be four feet long or
over the sport of landing so gamey a fish can be realized  when hooked
he invariably turns golden  the idea of the series of leaps is to rid
himself of the hook and the man who has made the strike must be of iron
or decadent if his heart does not beat with an extra flutter when he
beholds such gorgeous fish glittering in golden mail and shaking itself
like a stallion in each mid-air leap  ware slack  if you dont on one
of those leaps the hook will be flung out and twenty feet away  no
slack and away he will go on another run culminating in another series
of leaps  about this time one begins to worry over the line and to wish
that he had had nine hundred feet on the reel originally instead of six
hundred  with careful playing the line can be saved and after an hour
of keen excitement the fish can be brought to gaff  one such dolphin i
landed on the snark measured four feet and seven inches

hermann caught dolphins more prosaically  a hand-line and a chunk of
shark-meat were all he needed  his hand-line was very thick but on more
than one occasion it parted and lost the fish  one day a dolphin got
away with a lure of hermanns manufacture to which were lashed four
oshaughnessy hooks  within an hour the same dolphin was landed with the
rod and on dissecting him the four hooks were recovered  the dolphins
which remained with us over a month deserted us north of the line and
not one was seen during the remainder of the traverse

so the days passed  there was so much to be done that time never
dragged  had there been little to do time could not have dragged with
such wonderful seascapes and cloudscapes—dawns that were like burning
imperial cities under rainbows that arched nearly to the zenith sunsets
that bathed the purple sea in rivers of rose-coloured light flowing from
a sun whose diverging heaven-climbing rays were of the purest blue
overside in the heat of the day the sea was an azure satiny fabric in
the depths of which the sunshine focussed in funnels of light  astern
deep down when there was a breeze bubbled a procession of
milky-turquoise ghosts—the foam flung down by the hull of the snark
each time she floundered against a sea  at night the wake was
phosphorescent fire where the medusa slime resented our passing bulk
while far down could be observed the unceasing flight of comets with
long undulating nebulous tails—caused by the passage of the bonitas
through the resentful medusa slime  and now and again from out of the
darkness on either hand just under the surface larger phosphorescent
organisms flashed up like electric lights marking collisions with the
careless bonitas skurrying ahead to the good hunting just beyond our
bowsprit

we made our easting worked down through the doldrums and caught a fresh
breeze out of south-by-west  hauled up by the wind on such a slant we
would fetch past the marquesas far away to the westward  but the next
day on tuesday november 26 in the thick of a heavy squall the wind
shifted suddenly to the southeast  it was the trade at last  there were
no more squalls naught but fine weather a fair wind and a whirling
log with sheets slacked off and with spinnaker and mainsail swaying and
bellying on either side  the trade backed more and more until it blew
out of the northeast while we steered a steady course to the southwest
ten days of this and on the morning of december 6 at five oclock we
sighted land “just where it ought to have been” dead ahead  we passed
to leeward of ua-huka skirted the southern edge of nuka-hiva and that
night in driving squalls and inky darkness fought our way in to an
anchorage in the narrow bay of taiohae  the anchor rumbled down to the
blatting of wild goats on the cliffs and the air we breathed was heavy
with the perfume of flowers  the traverse was accomplished  sixty days
from land to land across a lonely sea above whose horizons never rise
the straining sails of ships




chapter x
typee


to the eastward ua-huka was being blotted out by an evening rain-squall
that was fast overtaking the snark  but that little craft her big
spinnaker filled by the southeast trade was making a good race of it
cape martin the southeasternmost point of nuku-hiva was abeam and
comptroller bay was opening up as we fled past its wide entrance where
sail rock for all the world like the spritsail of a columbia river
salmon-boat was making brave weather of it in the smashing southeast
swell

“what do you make that out to be?” i asked hermann at the wheel

“a fishing-boat sir” he answered after careful scrutiny

yet on the chart it was plainly marked “sail rock”

but we were more interested in the recesses of comptroller bay where our
eyes eagerly sought out the three bights of land and centred on the
midmost one where the gathering twilight showed the dim walls of a
valley extending inland  how often we had pored over the chart and
centred always on that midmost bight and on the valley it opened—the
valley of typee  “taipi” the chart spelled it and spelled it correctly
but i prefer “typee” and i shall always spell it “typee”  when i was a
little boy i read a book spelled in that manner—herman melvilles
“typee” and many long hours i dreamed over its pages  nor was it all
dreaming  i resolved there and then mightily come what would that
when i had gained strength and years i too would voyage to typee  for
the wonder of the world was penetrating to my tiny consciousness—the
wonder that was to lead me to many lands and that leads and never pails
the years passed but typee was not forgotten  returned to san francisco
from a seven months cruise in the north pacific i decided the time had
come  the brig galilee was sailing for the marquesas but her crew was
complete and i who was an able-seaman before the mast and young enough
to be overweeningly proud of it was willing to condescend to ship as
cabin-boy in order to make the pilgrimage to typee  of course the
galilee would have sailed from the marquesas without me for i was bent
on finding another fayaway and another kory-kory  i doubt that the
captain read desertion in my eye  perhaps even the berth of cabin-boy
was already filled  at any rate i did not get it

then came the rush of years filled brimming with projects achievements
and failures but typee was not forgotten and here i was now gazing at
its misty outlines till the squall swooped down and the snark dashed on
into the driving smother  ahead we caught a glimpse and took the
compass bearing of sentinel rock wreathed with pounding surf  then it
too was effaced by the rain and darkness  we steered straight for it
trusting to hear the sound of breakers in time to sheer clear  we had to
steer for it  we had naught but a compass bearing with which to
orientate ourselves and if we missed sentinel rock we missed taiohae
bay and we would have to throw the snark up to the wind and lie off
and on the whole night—no pleasant prospect for voyagers weary from a
sixty days traverse of the vast pacific solitude and land-hungry and
fruit-hungry and hungry with an appetite of years for the sweet vale of
typee

abruptly with a roar of sound sentinel rock loomed through the rain
dead ahead  we altered our course and with mainsail and spinnaker
bellying to the squall drove past  under the lea of the rock the wind
dropped us and we rolled in an absolute calm  then a puff of air struck
us right in our teeth out of taiohae bay  it was in spinnaker up
mizzen all sheets by the wind and we were moving slowly ahead heaving
the lead and straining our eyes for the fixed red light on the ruined
fort that would give us our bearings to anchorage  the air was light and
baffling now east now west now north now south while from either
hand came the roar of unseen breakers  from the looming cliffs arose the
blatting of wild goats and overhead the first stars were peeping mistily
through the ragged train of the passing squall  at the end of two hours
having come a mile into the bay we dropped anchor in eleven fathoms
and so we came to taiohae

in the morning we awoke in fairyland  the snark rested in a placid
harbour that nestled in a vast amphitheatre the towering vine-clad
walls of which seemed to rise directly from the water  far up to the
east we glimpsed the thin line of a trail visible in one place where
it scoured across the face of the wall

“the path by which toby escaped from typee” we cried

we were not long in getting ashore and astride horses though the
consummation of our pilgrimage had to be deferred for a day  two months
at sea bare-footed all the time without space in which to exercise
ones limbs is not the best preliminary to leather shoes and walking
besides the land had to cease its nauseous rolling before we could feel
fit for riding goat-like horses over giddy trails  so we took a short
ride to break in and crawled through thick jungle to make the
acquaintance of a venerable moss-grown idol where had foregathered a
german trader and a norwegian captain to estimate the weight of said
idol and to speculate upon depreciation in value caused by sawing him in
half  they treated the old fellow sacrilegiously digging their knives
into him to see how hard he was and how deep his mossy mantle and
commanding him to rise up and save them trouble by walking down to the
ship himself  in lieu of which nineteen kanakas slung him on a frame of
timbers and toted him to the ship where battened down under hatches
even now he is cleaving the south pacific hornward and toward europe—the
ultimate abiding-place for all good heathen idols save for the few in
america and one in particular who grins beside me as i write and who
barring shipwreck will grin somewhere in my neighbourhood until i die
and he will win out  he will be grinning when i am dust

also as a preliminary we attended a feast where one taiara tamarii
the son of an hawaiian sailor who deserted from a whaleship commemorated
the death of his marquesan mother by roasting fourteen whole hogs and
inviting in the village  so we came along welcomed by a native herald
a young girl who stood on a great rock and chanted the information that
the banquet was made perfect by our presence—which information she
extended impartially to every arrival  scarcely were we seated however
when she changed her tune while the company manifested intense
excitement  her cries became eager and piercing  from a distance came
answering cries in mens voices which blended into a wild barbaric
chant that sounded incredibly savage smacking of blood and war  then
through vistas of tropical foliage appeared a procession of savages
naked save for gaudy loin-cloths  they advanced slowly uttering deep
guttural cries of triumph and exaltation  slung from young saplings
carried on their shoulders were mysterious objects of considerable
weight hidden from view by wrappings of green leaves

nothing but pigs innocently fat and roasted to a turn were inside those
wrappings but the men were carrying them into camp in imitation of old
times when they carried in “long-pig”  now long-pig is not pig
long-pig is the polynesian euphemism for human flesh and these
descendants of man-eaters a kings son at their head brought in the
pigs to table as of old their grandfathers had brought in their slain
enemies  every now and then the procession halted in order that the
bearers should have every advantage in uttering particularly ferocious
shouts of victory of contempt for their enemies and of gustatory
desire  so melville two generations ago witnessed the bodies of slain
happar warriors wrapped in palm-leaves carried to banquet at the ti
at another time at the ti he “observed a curiously carved vessel of
wood” and on looking into it his eyes “fell upon the disordered members
of a human skeleton the bones still fresh with moisture and with
particles of flesh clinging to them here and there”

cannibalism has often been regarded as a fairy story by ultracivilized
men who dislike perhaps the notion that their own savage forebears have
somewhere in the past been addicted to similar practices  captain cook
was rather sceptical upon the subject until one day in a harbour of
new zealand he deliberately tested the matter  a native happened to
have brought on board for sale a nice sun-dried head  at cooks
orders strips of the flesh were cut away and handed to the native who
greedily devoured them  to say the least captain cook was a rather
thorough-going empiricist  at any rate by that act he supplied one
ascertained fact of which science had been badly in need  little did he
dream of the existence of a certain group of islands thousands of miles
away where in subsequent days there would arise a curious suit at law
when an old chief of maui would be charged with defamation of character
because he persisted in asserting that his body was the living repository
of captain cooks great toe  it is said that the plaintiffs failed to
prove that the old chief was not the tomb of the navigators great toe
and that the suit was dismissed

i suppose i shall not have the chance in these degenerate days to see any
long-pig eaten but at least i am already the possessor of a duly
certified marquesan calabash oblong in shape curiously carved over a
century old from which has been drunk the blood of two shipmasters  one
of those captains was a mean man  he sold a decrepit whale-boat as good
as new what of the fresh white paint to a marquesan chief  but no
sooner had the captain sailed away than the whale-boat dropped to pieces
it was his fortune some time afterwards to be wrecked of all places
on that particular island  the marquesan chief was ignorant of rebates
and discounts but he had a primitive sense of equity and an equally
primitive conception of the economy of nature and he balanced the
account by eating the man who had cheated him

we started in the cool dawn for typee astride ferocious little stallions
that pawed and screamed and bit and fought one another quite oblivious of
the fragile humans on their backs and of the slippery boulders loose
rocks and yawning gorges  the way led up an ancient road through a
jungle of hau trees  on every side were the vestiges of a one-time
dense population  wherever the eye could penetrate the thick growth
glimpses were caught of stone walls and of stone foundations six to
eight feet in height built solidly throughout and many yards in width
and depth  they formed great stone platforms upon which at one time
there had been houses  but the houses and the people were gone and huge
trees sank their roots through the platforms and towered over the
under-running jungle  these foundations are called pae-paes—the
pi-pis of melville who spelled phonetically

the marquesans of the present generation lack the energy to hoist and
place such huge stones  also they lack incentive  there are plenty of
pae-paes to go around with a few thousand unoccupied ones left over
once or twice as we ascended the valley we saw magnificent pae-paes
bearing on their general surface pitiful little straw huts the
proportions being similar to a voting booth perched on the broad
foundation of the pyramid of cheops  for the marquesans are perishing
and to judge from conditions at taiohae the one thing that retards
their destruction is the infusion of fresh blood  a pure marquesan is a
rarity  they seem to be all half-breeds and strange conglomerations of
dozens of different races  nineteen able labourers are all the trader at
taiohae can muster for the loading of copra on shipboard and in their
veins runs the blood of english american dane german french
corsican spanish portuguese chinese hawaiian paumotan tahitian and
easter islander  there are more races than there are persons but it is
a wreckage of races at best  life faints and stumbles and gasps itself
away  in this warm equable clime—a truly terrestrial paradise—where are
never extremes of temperature and where the air is like balm kept ever
pure by the ozone-laden southeast trade asthma phthisis and
tuberculosis flourish as luxuriantly as the vegetation  everywhere from
the few grass huts arises the racking cough or exhausted groan of wasted
lungs  other horrible diseases prosper as well but the most deadly of
all are those that attack the lungs  there is a form of consumption
called “galloping” which is especially dreaded  in two months time it
reduces the strongest man to a skeleton under a grave-cloth  in valley
after valley the last inhabitant has passed and the fertile soil has
relapsed to jungle  in melvilles day the valley of hapaa (spelled by
him “happar”) was peopled by a strong and warlike tribe  a generation
later it contained but two hundred persons  to-day it is an untenanted
howling tropical wilderness

we climbed higher and higher in the valley our unshod stallions picking
their steps on the disintegrating trail which led in and out through the
abandoned pae-paes and insatiable jungle  the sight of red mountain
apples the ohias familiar to us from hawaii caused a native to be
sent climbing after them  and again he climbed for cocoa-nuts  i have
drunk the cocoanuts of jamaica and of hawaii but i never knew how
delicious such draught could be till i drank it here in the marquesas
occasionally we rode under wild limes and oranges—great trees which had
survived the wilderness longer than the motes of humans who had
cultivated them

we rode through endless thickets of yellow-pollened cassi—if riding it
could be called for those fragrant thickets were inhabited by wasps
and such wasps  great yellow fellows the size of small canary birds
darting through the air with behind them drifting a bunch of legs a
couple of inches long  a stallion abruptly stands on his forelegs and
thrusts his hind legs skyward  he withdraws them from the sky long
enough to make one wild jump ahead and then returns them to their index
position  it is nothing  his thick hide has merely been punctured by a
flaming lance of wasp virility  then a second and a third stallion and
all the stallions begin to cavort on their forelegs over the precipitous
landscape  swat  a white-hot poniard penetrates my cheek  swat again
i am stabbed in the neck  i am bringing up the rear and getting more
than my share  there is no retreat and the plunging horses ahead on a
precarious trail promise little safety  my horse overruns charmians
horse and that sensitive creature fresh-stung at the psychological
moment planks one of his hoofs into my horse and the other hoof into me
i thank my stars that he is not steel-shod and half-arise from the
saddle at the impact of another flaming dagger  i am certainly getting
more than my share and so is my poor horse whose pain and panic are
only exceeded by mine

“get out of the way  im coming” i shout frantically dashing my cap at
the winged vipers around me

on one side of the trail the landscape rises straight up  on the other
side it sinks straight down  the only way to get out of my way is to
keep on going  how that string of horses kept their feet is a miracle
but they dashed ahead over-running one another galloping trotting
stumbling jumping scrambling and kicking methodically skyward every
time a wasp landed on them  after a while we drew breath and counted our
injuries  and this happened not once nor twice but time after time
strange to say it never grew monotonous  i know that i for one came
through each brush with the undiminished zest of a man flying from sudden
death  no the pilgrim from taiohae to typee will never suffer from
ennui on the way

at last we arose above the vexation of wasps  it was a matter of
altitude however rather than of fortitude  all about us lay the jagged
back-bones of ranges as far as the eye could see thrusting their
pinnacles into the trade-wind clouds  under us from the way we had
come the snark lay like a tiny toy on the calm water of taiohae bay
ahead we could see the inshore indentation of comptroller bay  we
dropped down a thousand feet and typee lay beneath us  “had a glimpse
of the gardens of paradise been revealed to me i could scarcely have been
more ravished with the sight”—so said melville on the moment of his first
view of the valley  he saw a garden  we saw a wilderness  where were
the hundred groves of the breadfruit tree he saw?  we saw jungle nothing
but jungle with the exception of two grass huts and several clumps of
cocoanuts breaking the primordial green mantle  where was the ti of
mehevi the bachelors hall the palace where women were taboo and where
he ruled with his lesser chieftains keeping the half-dozen dusty and
torpid ancients to remind them of the valorous past?  from the swift
stream no sounds arose of maids and matrons pounding tapa  and where
was the hut that old narheyo eternally builded?  in vain i looked for him
perched ninety feet from the ground in some tall cocoanut taking his
morning smoke

we went down a zigzag trail under overarching matted jungle where great
butterflies drifted by in the silence  no tattooed savage with club and
javelin guarded the path and when we forded the stream we were free to
roam where we pleased  no longer did the taboo sacred and merciless
reign in that sweet vale  nay the taboo still did reign a new taboo
for when we approached too near the several wretched native women the
taboo was uttered warningly  and it was well  they were lepers  the
man who warned us was afflicted horribly with elephantiasis  all were
suffering from lung trouble  the valley of typee was the abode of death
and the dozen survivors of the tribe were gasping feebly the last painful
breaths of the race

certainly the battle had not been to the strong for once the typeans
were very strong stronger than the happars stronger than the
taiohaeans stronger than all the tribes of nuku-hiva  the word “typee”
or rather “taipi” originally signified an eater of human flesh  but
since all the marquesans were human-flesh eaters to be so designated was
the token that the typeans were the human-flesh eaters par excellence
not alone to nuku-hiva did the typean reputation for bravery and ferocity
extend  in all the islands of the marquesas the typeans were named with
dread  man could not conquer them  even the french fleet that took
possession of the marquesas left the typeans alone  captain porter of
the frigate essex once invaded the valley  his sailors and marines
were reinforced by two thousand warriors of happar and taiohae  they
penetrated quite a distance into the valley but met with so fierce a
resistance that they were glad to retreat and get away in their flotilla
of boats and war-canoes

of all inhabitants of the south seas the marquesans were adjudged the
strongest and the most beautiful  melville said of them “i was
especially struck by the physical strength and beauty they displayed   
in beauty of form they surpassed anything i had ever seen  not a
single instance of natural deformity was observable in all the throng
attending the revels  every individual appeared free from those
blemishes which sometimes mar the effect of an otherwise perfect form
but their physical excellence did not merely consist in an exemption from
these evils nearly every individual of the number might have been taken
for a sculptors model”  mendaña the discoverer of the marquesas
described the natives as wondrously beautiful to behold  figueroa the
chronicler of his voyage said of them “in complexion they were nearly
white of good stature and finely formed”  captain cook called the
marquesans the most splendid islanders in the south seas  the men were
described as “in almost every instance of lofty stature scarcely ever
less than six feet in height”

and now all this strength and beauty has departed and the valley of
typee is the abode of some dozen wretched creatures afflicted by
leprosy elephantiasis and tuberculosis  melville estimated the
population at two thousand not taking into consideration the small
adjoining valley of ho-o-u-mi  life has rotted away in this wonderful
garden spot where the climate is as delightful and healthful as any to
be found in the world  not alone were the typeans physically
magnificent they were pure  their air did not contain the bacilli and
germs and microbes of disease that fill our own air  and when the white
men imported in their ships these various micro-organisms or disease the
typeans crumpled up and went down before them

when one considers the situation one is almost driven to the conclusion
that the white race flourishes on impurity and corruption  natural
selection however gives the explanation  we of the white race are the
survivors and the descendants of the thousands of generations of
survivors in the war with the micro-organisms  whenever one of us was
born with a constitution peculiarly receptive to these minute enemies
such a one promptly died  only those of us survived who could withstand
them  we who are alive are the immune the fit—the ones best constituted
to live in a world of hostile micro-organisms  the poor marquesans had
undergone no such selection  they were not immune  and they who had
made a custom of eating their enemies were now eaten by enemies so
microscopic as to be invisible and against whom no war of dart and
javelin was possible  on the other hand had there been a few hundred
thousand marquesans to begin with there might have been sufficient
survivors to lay the foundation for a new race—a regenerated race if a
plunge into a festering bath of organic poison can be called
regeneration

we unsaddled our horses for lunch and after we had fought the stallions
apart—mine with several fresh chunks bitten out of his back—and after we
had vainly fought the sand-flies we ate bananas and tinned meats washed
down by generous draughts of cocoanut milk  there was little to be seen
the jungle had rushed back and engulfed the puny works of man  here and
there pai-pais were to be stumbled upon but there were no
inscriptions no hieroglyphics no clues to the past they attested—only
dumb stones builded and carved by hands that were forgotten dust  out
of the pai-pais grew great trees jealous of the wrought work of man
splitting and scattering the stones back into the primeval chaos

we gave up the jungle and sought the stream with the idea of evading the
sand-flies  vain hope  to go in swimming one must take off his clothes
the sand-flies are aware of the fact and they lurk by the river bank in
countless myriads  in the native they are called the nau-nau which is
pronounced “now-now”  they are certainly well named for they are the
insistent present  there is no past nor future when they fasten upon
ones epidermis and i am willing to wager that omer khayyám could never
have written the rubáiyat in the valley of typee—it would have been
psychologically impossible  i made the strategic mistake of undressing
on the edge of a steep bank where i could dive in but could not climb
out  when i was ready to dress i had a hundred yards walk on the bank
before i could reach my clothes  at the first step fully ten thousand
nau-naus landed upon me  at the second step i was walking in a cloud
by the third step the sun was dimmed in the sky  after that i dont know
what happened  when i arrived at my clothes i was a maniac  and here
enters my grand tactical error  there is only one rule of conduct in
dealing with nau-naus  never swat them  whatever you do dont swat
them  they are so vicious that in the instant of annihilation they eject
their last atom of poison into your carcass  you must pluck them
delicately between thumb and forefinger and persuade them gently to
remove their proboscides from your quivering flesh  it is like pulling
teeth  but the difficulty was that the teeth sprouted faster than i
could pull them so i swatted and so doing filled myself full with
their poison  this was a week ago  at the present moment i resemble a
sadly neglected smallpox convalescent

ho-o-u-mi is a small valley separated from typee by a low ridge and
thither we started when we had knocked our indomitable and insatiable
riding-animals into submission  as it was warrens mount after a mile
run selected the most dangerous part of the trail for an exhibition that
kept us all on the anxious seat for fully five minutes  we rode by the
mouth of typee valley and gazed down upon the beach from which melville
escaped  there was where the whale-boat lay on its oars close in to the
surf and there was where karakoee the taboo kanaka stood in the water
and trafficked for the sailors life  there surely was where melville
gave fayaway the parting embrace ere he dashed for the boat  and there
was the point of land from which mehevi and mow-mow and their following
swam off to intercept the boat only to have their wrists gashed by
sheath-knives when they laid hold of the gunwale though it was reserved
for mow-mow to receive the boat-hook full in the throat from melvilles
hands

we rode on to ho-o-u-mi  so closely was melville guarded that he never
dreamed of the existence of this valley though he must continually have
met its inhabitants for they belonged to typee  we rode through the
same abandoned pae-paes but as we neared the sea we found a profusion
of cocoanuts breadfruit trees and taro patches and fully a dozen grass
dwellings  in one of these we arranged to pass the night and
preparations were immediately put on foot for a feast  a young pig was
promptly despatched and while he was being roasted among hot stones and
while chickens were stewing in cocoanut milk i persuaded one of the
cooks to climb an unusually tall cocoanut palm  the cluster of nuts at
the top was fully one hundred and twenty-five feet from the ground but
that native strode up to the tree seized it in both hands jack-knived
at the waist so that the soles of his feet rested flatly against the
trunk and then he walked right straight up without stopping  there were
no notches in the tree  he had no ropes to help him  he merely walked
up the tree one hundred and twenty-five feet in the air and cast down
the nuts from the summit  not every man there had the physical stamina
for such a feat or the lungs rather for most of them were coughing
their lives away  some of the women kept up a ceaseless moaning and
groaning so badly were their lungs wasted  very few of either sex were
full-blooded marquesans  they were mostly half-breeds and
three-quarter-breeds of french english danish and chinese extraction
at the best these infusions of fresh blood merely delayed the passing
and the results led one to wonder whether it was worth while

the feast was served on a broad pae-pae the rear portion of which was
occupied by the house in which we were to sleep  the first course was
raw fish and poi-poi the latter sharp and more acrid of taste than the
poi of hawaii which is made from taro  the poi-poi of the marquesas
is made from breadfruit  the ripe fruit after the core is removed is
placed in a calabash and pounded with a stone pestle into a stiff sticky
paste  in this stage of the process wrapped in leaves it can be buried
in the ground where it will keep for years  before it can be eaten
however further processes are necessary  a leaf-covered package is
placed among hot stones like the pig and thoroughly baked  after that
it is mixed with cold water and thinned out—not thin enough to run but
thin enough to be eaten by sticking ones first and second fingers into
it  on close acquaintance it proves a pleasant and most healthful food
and breadfruit ripe and well boiled or roasted  it is delicious
breadfruit and taro are kingly vegetables the pair of them though the
former is patently a misnomer and more resembles a sweet potato than
anything else though it is not mealy like a sweet potato nor is it so
sweet

the feast ended we watched the moon rise over typee  the air was like
balm faintly scented with the breath of flowers  it was a magic night
deathly still without the slightest breeze to stir the foliage and one
caught ones breath and felt the pang that is almost hurt so exquisite
was the beauty of it  faint and far could be heard the thin thunder of
the surf upon the beach  there were no beds and we drowsed and slept
wherever we thought the floor softest  near by a woman panted and
moaned in her sleep and all about us the dying islanders coughed in the
night




chapter xi
the nature man


i first met him on market street in san francisco  it was a wet and
drizzly afternoon and he was striding along clad solely in a pair of
abbreviated knee-trousers and an abbreviated shirt his bare feet going
slick-slick through the pavement-slush  at his heels trooped a score of
excited gamins  every head—and there were thousands—turned to glance
curiously at him as he went by  and i turned too  never had i seen
such lovely sunburn  he was all sunburn of the sort a blond takes on
when his skin does not peel  his long yellow hair was burnt so was his
beard which sprang from a soil unploughed by any razor  he was a tawny
man a golden-tawny man all glowing and radiant with the sun  another
prophet thought i come up to town with a message that will save the
world

a few weeks later i was with some friends in their bungalow in the
piedmont hills overlooking san francisco bay  “weve got him weve got
him” they barked  “we caught him up a tree but hes all right now
hell feed from the hand  come on and see him”  so i accompanied them
up a dizzy hill and in a rickety shack in the midst of a eucalyptus
grove found my sunburned prophet of the city pavements

he hastened to meet us arriving in the whirl and blur of a handspring
he did not shake hands with us instead his greeting took the form of
stunts  he turned more handsprings  he twisted his body sinuously like
a snake until having sufficiently limbered up he bent from the hips
and with legs straight and knees touching beat a tattoo on the ground
with the palms of his hands  he whirligigged and pirouetted dancing and
cavorting round like an inebriated ape  all the sun-warmth of his ardent
life beamed in his face  i am so happy was the song without words he
sang

he sang it all evening ringing the changes on it with an endless variety
of stunts  “a fool a fool  i met a fool in the forest” thought i and
a worthy fool he proved  between handsprings and whirligigs he delivered
his message that would save the world  it was twofold  first let
suffering humanity strip off its clothing and run wild in the mountains
and valleys and second let the very miserable world adopt phonetic
spelling  i caught a glimpse of the great social problems being settled
by the city populations swarming naked over the landscape to the popping
of shot-guns the barking of ranch-dogs and countless assaults with
pitchforks wielded by irate farmers

the years passed and one sunny morning the snark poked her nose into
a narrow opening in a reef that smoked with the crashing impact of the
trade-wind swell and beat slowly up papeete harbour  coming off to us
was a boat flying a yellow flag  we knew it contained the port doctor
but quite a distance off in its wake was a tiny out rigger canoe that
puzzled us  it was flying a red flag  i studied it through the glasses
fearing that it marked some hidden danger to navigation some recent
wreck or some buoy or beacon that had been swept away  then the doctor
came on board  after he had examined the state of our health and been
assured that we had no live rats hidden away in the snark i asked him
the meaning of the red flag  “oh that is darling” was the answer

and then darling ernest darling flying the red flag that is indicative
of the brotherhood of man hailed us  “hello jack” he called  “hello
charmian”  he paddled swiftly nearer and i saw that he was the tawny
prophet of the piedmont hills  he came over the side a sun-god clad in
a scarlet loin-cloth with presents of arcady and greeting in both his
hands—a bottle of golden honey and a leaf-basket filled with great
golden mangoes golden bananas specked with freckles of deeper gold
golden pine-apples and golden limes and juicy oranges minted from the
same precious ore of sun and soil  and in this fashion under the
southern sky i met once more darling the nature man

tahiti is one of the most beautiful spots in the world inhabited by
thieves and robbers and liars also by several honest and truthful men
and women  wherefore because of the blight cast upon tahitis wonderful
beauty by the spidery human vermin that infest it i am minded to write
not of tahiti but of the nature man  he at least is refreshing and
wholesome  the spirit that emanates from him is so gentle and sweet that
it would harm nothing hurt nobodys feelings save the feelings of a
predatory and plutocratic capitalist

“what does this red flag mean?” i asked

“socialism of course”

“yes yes i know that” i went on “but what does it mean in your
hands?”

“why that ive found my message”

“and that you are delivering it to tahiti?” i demanded incredulously

“sure” he answered simply and later on i found that he was too

when we dropped anchor lowered a small boat into the water and started
ashore the nature man joined us  now thought i i shall be pestered to
death by this crank  waking or sleeping i shall never be quit of him
until i sail away from here

but never in my life was i more mistaken  i took a house and went to
live and work in it and the nature man never came near me  he was
waiting for the invitation  in the meantime he went aboard the snark
and took possession of her library delighted by the quantity of
scientific books and shocked as i learned afterwards by the inordinate
amount of fiction  the nature man never wastes time on fiction

after a week or so my conscience smote me and i invited him to dinner
at a downtown hotel

he arrived looking unwontedly stiff and uncomfortable in a cotton
jacket  when invited to peel it off he beamed his gratitude and joy
and did so revealing his sun-gold skin from waist to shoulder covered
only by a piece of fish-net of coarse twine and large of mesh  a scarlet
loin-cloth completed his costume  i began my acquaintance with him that
night and during my long stay in tahiti that acquaintance ripened into
friendship

“so you write books” he said one day when tired and sweaty i finished
my mornings work

“i too write books” he announced

aha thought i now at last is he going to pester me with his literary
efforts  my soul was in revolt  i had not come all the way to the south
seas to be a literary bureau

“this is the book i write” he explained smashing himself a resounding
blow on the chest with his clenched fist  “the gorilla in the african
jungle pounds his chest till the noise of it can be heard half a mile
away”

“a pretty good chest” quoth i admiringly “it would even make a gorilla
envious”

and then and later i learned the details of the marvellous book ernest
darling had written  twelve years ago he lay close to death  he weighed
but ninety pounds and was too weak to speak  the doctors had given him
up  his father a practising physician had given him up  consultations
with other physicians had been held upon him  there was no hope for him
overstudy (as a school-teacher and as a university student) and two
successive attacks of pneumonia were responsible for his breakdown  day
by day he was losing strength  he could extract no nutrition from the
heavy foods they gave him nor could pellets and powders help his stomach
to do the work of digestion  not only was he a physical wreck but he
was a mental wreck  his mind was overwrought  he was sick and tired of
medicine and he was sick and tired of persons  human speech jarred upon
him  human attentions drove him frantic  the thought came to him that
since he was going to die he might as well die in the open away from
all the bother and irritation  and behind this idea lurked a sneaking
idea that perhaps he would not die after all if only he could escape from
the heavy foods the medicines and the well-intentioned persons who made
him frantic

so ernest darling a bag of bones and a deaths-head a perambulating
corpse with just the dimmest flutter of life in it to make it
perambulate turned his back upon men and the habitations of men and
dragged himself for five miles through the brush away from the city of
portland oregon  of course he was crazy  only a lunatic would drag
himself out of his death-bed

but in the brush darling found what he was looking for—rest  nobody
bothered him with beefsteaks and pork  no physicians lacerated his tired
nerves by feeling his pulse nor tormented his tired stomach with pellets
and powders  he began to feel soothed  the sun was shining warm and he
basked in it  he had the feeling that the sun shine was an elixir of
health  then it seemed to him that his whole wasted wreck of a body was
crying for the sun  he stripped off his clothes and bathed in the
sunshine  he felt better  it had done him good—the first relief in
weary months of pain

as he grew better he sat up and began to take notice  all about him
were the birds fluttering and chirping the squirrels chattering and
playing  he envied them their health and spirits their happy care-free
existence  that he should contrast their condition with his was
inevitable and that he should question why they were splendidly vigorous
while he was a feeble dying wraith of a man was likewise inevitable
his conclusion was the very obvious one namely that they lived
naturally while he lived most unnaturally therefore if he intended to
live he must return to nature

alone there in the brush he worked out his problem and began to apply
it  he stripped off his clothing and leaped and gambolled about running
on all fours climbing trees in short doing physical stunts—and all
the time soaking in the sunshine  he imitated the animals  he built a
nest of dry leaves and grasses in which to sleep at night covering it
over with bark as a protection against the early fall rains  “here is a
beautiful exercise” he told me once flapping his arms mightily against
his sides “i learned it from watching the roosters crow”  another time
i remarked the loud sucking intake with which he drank cocoanut-milk
he explained that he had noticed the cows drinking that way and concluded
there must be something in it  he tried it and found it good and
thereafter he drank only in that fashion

he noted that the squirrels lived on fruits and nuts  he started on a
fruit-and-nut diet helped out by bread and he grew stronger and put on
weight  for three months he continued his primordial existence in the
brush and then the heavy oregon rains drove him back to the habitations
of men  not in three months could a ninety-pound survivor of two attacks
of pneumonia develop sufficient ruggedness to live through an oregon
winter in the open

he had accomplished much but he had been driven in  there was no place
to go but back to his fathers house and there living in close rooms
with lungs that panted for all the air of the open sky he was brought
down by a third attack of pneumonia  he grew weaker even than before
in that tottering tabernacle of flesh his brain collapsed  he lay like
a corpse too weak to stand the fatigue of speaking too irritated and
tired in his miserable brain to care to listen to the speech of others
the only act of will of which he was capable was to stick his fingers in
his ears and resolutely to refuse to hear a single word that was spoken
to him  they sent for the insanity experts  he was adjudged insane and
also the verdict was given that he would not live a month

by one such mental expert he was carted off to a sanatorium on mt tabor
here when they learned that he was harmless they gave him his own way
they no longer dictated as to the food he ate so he resumed his fruits
and nuts—olive oil peanut butter and bananas the chief articles of his
diet  as he regained his strength he made up his mind to live
thenceforth his own life  if he lived like others according to social
conventions he would surely die  and he did not want to die  the fear
of death was one of the strongest factors in the genesis of the nature
man  to live he must have a natural diet the open air and the blessed
sunshine

now an oregon winter has no inducements for those who wish to return to
nature so darling started out in search of a climate  he mounted a
bicycle and headed south for the sunlands  stanford university claimed
him for a year  here he studied and worked his way attending lectures
in as scant garb as the authorities would allow and applying as much as
possible the principles of living that he had learned in squirrel-town
his favourite method of study was to go off in the hills back of the
university and there to strip off his clothes and lie on the grass
soaking in sunshine and health at the same time that he soaked in
knowledge

but central california has her winters and the quest for a nature mans
climate drew him on  he tried los angeles and southern california being
arrested a few times and brought before the insanity commissions because
forsooth his mode of life was not modelled after the mode of life of his
fellow-men  he tried hawaii where unable to prove him insane the
authorities deported him  it was not exactly a deportation  he could
have remained by serving a year in prison  they gave him his choice
now prison is death to the nature man who thrives only in the open air
and in gods sunshine  the authorities of hawaii are not to be blamed
darling was an undesirable citizen  any man is undesirable who disagrees
with one  and that any man should disagree to the extent darling did in
his philosophy of the simple life is ample vindication of the hawaiian
authorities verdict of his undesirableness

so darling went thence in search of a climate which would not only be
desirable but wherein he would not be undesirable  and he found it in
tahiti the garden-spot of garden-spots  and so it was according to the
narrative as given that he wrote the pages of his book  he wears only a
loin-cloth and a sleeveless fish-net shirt  his stripped weight is one
hundred and sixty-five pounds  his health is perfect  his eyesight
that at one time was considered ruined is excellent  the lungs that
were practically destroyed by three attacks of pneumonia have not only
recovered but are stronger than ever before

i shall never forget the first time while talking to me that he
squashed a mosquito  the stinging pest had settled in the middle of his
back between his shoulders  without interrupting the flow of
conversation without dropping even a syllable his clenched fist shot up
in the air curved backward and smote his back between the shoulders
killing the mosquito and making his frame resound like a bass drum  it
reminded me of nothing so much as of horses kicking the woodwork in their
stalls

“the gorilla in the african jungle pounds his chest until the noise of it
can be heard half a mile away” he will announce suddenly and thereat
beat a hair-raising devils tattoo on his own chest

one day he noticed a set of boxing-gloves hanging on the wall and
promptly his eyes brightened

“do you box?” i asked

“i used to give lessons in boxing when i was at stanford” was the reply

and there and then we stripped and put on the gloves  bang a long
gorilla arm flashed out landing the gloved end on my nose  biff he
caught me in a duck on the side of the head nearly knocking me over
sidewise  i carried the lump raised by that blow for a week  i ducked
under a straight left and landed a straight right on his stomach  it
was a fearful blow  the whole weight of my body was behind it and his
body had been met as it lunged forward  i looked for him to crumple up
and go down  instead of which his face beamed approval and he said
“that was beautiful”  the next instant i was covering up and striving to
protect myself from a hurricane of hooks jolts and uppercuts  then i
watched my chance and drove in for the solar plexus  i hit the mark
the nature man dropped his arms gasped and sat down suddenly

“ill be all right” he said  “just wait a moment”

and inside thirty seconds he was on his feet—ay and returning the
compliment for he hooked me in the solar plexus and i gasped dropped
my hands and sat down just a trifle more suddenly than he had

all of which i submit as evidence that the man i boxed with was a totally
different man from the poor ninety-pound weight of eight years before
who given up by physicians and alienists lay gasping his life away in a
closed room in portland oregon  the book that ernest darling has
written is a good book and the binding is good too

hawaii has wailed for years her need for desirable immigrants  she has
spent much time and thought and money in importing desirable citizens
and she has as yet nothing much to show for it  yet hawaii deported
the nature man  she refused to give him a chance  so it is to chasten
hawaiis proud spirit that i take this opportunity to show her what she
has lost in the nature man  when he arrived in tahiti he proceeded to
seek out a piece of land on which to grow the food he ate  but land was
difficult to find—that is inexpensive land  the nature man was not
rolling in wealth  he spent weeks in wandering over the steep hills
until high up the mountain where clustered several tiny canyons he
found eighty acres of brush-jungle which were apparently unrecorded as
the property of any one  the government officials told him that if he
would clear the land and till it for thirty years he would be given a
title for it

immediately he set to work  and never was there such work  nobody
farmed that high up  the land was covered with matted jungle and overrun
by wild pigs and countless rats  the view of papeete and the sea was
magnificent but the outlook was not encouraging  he spent weeks in
building a road in order to make the plantation accessible  the pigs and
the rats ate up whatever he planted as fast as it sprouted  he shot the
pigs and trapped the rats  of the latter in two weeks he caught fifteen
hundred  everything had to be carried up on his back  he usually did
his packhorse work at night

gradually he began to win out  a grass-walled house was built  on the
fertile volcanic soil he had wrested from the jungle and jungle beasts
were growing five hundred cocoanut trees five hundred papaia trees
three hundred mango trees many breadfruit trees and alligator-pear
trees to say nothing of vines bushes and vegetables  he developed the
drip of the hills in the canyons and worked out an efficient irrigation
scheme ditching the water from canyon to canyon and paralleling the
ditches at different altitudes  his narrow canyons became botanical
gardens  the arid shoulders of the hills where formerly the blazing sun
had parched the jungle and beaten it close to earth blossomed into trees
and shrubs and flowers  not only had the nature man become
self-supporting but he was now a prosperous agriculturist with produce
to sell to the city-dwellers of papeete

then it was discovered that his land which the government officials had
informed him was without an owner really had an owner and that deeds
descriptions etc were on record  all his work bade fare to be lost
the land had been valueless when he took it up and the owner a large
landholder was unaware of the extent to which the nature man had
developed it  a just price was agreed upon and darlings deed was
officially filed

next came a more crushing blow  darlings access to market was
destroyed  the road he had built was fenced across by triple barb-wire
fences  it was one of those jumbles in human affairs that is so common
in this absurdest of social systems  behind it was the fine hand of the
same conservative element that haled the nature man before the insanity
commission in los angeles and that deported him from hawaii  it is so
hard for self-satisfied men to understand any man whose satisfactions are
fundamentally different  it seems clear that the officials have connived
with the conservative element for to this day the road the nature man
built is closed nothing has been done about it while an adamant
unwillingness to do anything about it is evidenced on every hand  but
the nature man dances and sings along his way  he does not sit up nights
thinking about the wrong which has been done him he leaves the worrying
to the doers of the wrong  he has no time for bitterness  he believes
he is in the world for the purpose of being happy and he has not a
moment to waste in any other pursuit

the road to his plantation is blocked  he cannot build a new road for
there is no ground on which he can build it  the government has
restricted him to a wild-pig trail which runs precipitously up the
mountain  i climbed the trail with him and we had to climb with hands
and feet in order to get up  nor can that wild-pig trail be made into a
road by any amount of toil less than that of an engineer a steam-engine
and a steel cable  but what does the nature man care?  in his gentle
ethics the evil men do him he requites with goodness  and who shall say
he is not happier than they?

“never mind their pesky road” he said to me as we dragged ourselves up a
shelf of rock and sat down panting to rest  “ill get an air machine
soon and fool them  im clearing a level space for a landing stage for
the airships and next time you come to tahiti you will alight right at
my door”

yes the nature man has some strange ideas besides that of the gorilla
pounding his chest in the african jungle  the nature man has ideas about
levitation  “yes sir” he said to me “levitation is not impossible
and think of the glory of it—lifting ones self from the ground by an act
of will  think of it  the astronomers tell us that our whole solar
system is dying that barring accidents it will all be so cold that no
life can live upon it  very well  in that day all men will be
accomplished levitationists and they will leave this perishing planet
and seek more hospitable worlds  how can levitation be accomplished?  by
progressive fasts  yes i have tried them and toward the end i could
feel myself actually getting lighter”

the man is a maniac thought i

“of course” he added “these are only theories of mine  i like to
speculate upon the glorious future of man  levitation may not be
possible but i like to think of it as possible”

one evening when he yawned i asked him how much sleep he allowed
himself

“seven hours” was the answer  “but in ten years ill be sleeping only
six hours and in twenty years only five hours  you see i shall cut off
an hours sleep every ten years”

“then when you are a hundred you wont be sleeping at all” i
interjected

“just that  exactly that  when i am a hundred i shall not require
sleep  also i shall be living on air  there are plants that live on
air you know”

“but has any man ever succeeded in doing it?”

he shook his head

“i never heard of him if he did  but it is only a theory of mine this
living on air  it would be fine wouldnt it?  of course it may be
impossible—most likely it is  you see i am not unpractical  i never
forget the present  when i soar ahead into the future i always leave a
string by which to find my way back again”

i fear me the nature man is a joker  at any rate he lives the simple
life  his laundry bill cannot be large  up on his plantation he lives
on fruit the labour cost of which in cash he estimates at five cents a
day  at present because of his obstructed road and because he is head
over heels in the propaganda of socialism he is living in town where
his expenses including rent are twenty-five cents a day  in order to
pay those expenses he is running a night school for chinese

the nature man is not bigoted  when there is nothing better to eat than
meat he eats meat as for instance when in jail or on shipboard and
the nuts and fruits give out  nor does he seem to crystallize into
anything except sunburn

“drop anchor anywhere and the anchor will drag—that is if your soul is a
limitless fathomless sea and not dog-pound” he quoted to me then
added “you see my anchor is always dragging  i live for human health
and progress and i strive to drag my anchor always in that direction
to me the two are identical  dragging anchor is what has saved me  my
anchor did not hold me to my death-bed  i dragged anchor into the brush
and fooled the doctors  when i recovered health and strength i started
by preaching and by example to teach the people to become nature men and
nature women  but they had deaf ears  then on the steamer coming to
tahiti a quarter-master expounded socialism to me  he showed me that an
economic square deal was necessary before men and women could live
naturally  so i dragged anchor once more and now i am working for the
co-operative commonwealth  when that arrives it will be easy to bring
about nature living

“i had a dream last night” he went on thoughtfully his face slowly
breaking into a glow  “it seemed that twenty-five nature men and nature
women had just arrived on the steamer from california and that i was
starting to go with them up the wild-pig trail to the plantation”

ah me ernest darling sun-worshipper and nature man there are times
when i am compelled to envy you and your carefree existence  i see you
now dancing up the steps and cutting antics on the veranda your hair
dripping from a plunge in the salt sea your eyes sparkling your
sun-gilded body flashing your chest resounding to the devils own tattoo
as you chant “the gorilla in the african jungle pounds his chest until
the noise of it can be heard half a mile away”  and i shall see you
always as i saw you that last day when the snark poked her nose once
more through the passage in the smoking reef outward bound and i waved
good-bye to those on shore  not least in goodwill and affection was the
wave i gave to the golden sun-god in the scarlet loin-cloth standing
upright in his tiny outrigger canoe




chapter xii
the high seat of abundance


    on the arrival of strangers every man endeavoured to obtain one as a
    friend and carry him off to his own habitation where he is treated
    with the greatest kindness by the inhabitants of the district they
    place him on a high seat and feed him with abundance of the finest
    food—polynesian researches

the snark was lying at anchor at raiatea just off the village of
uturoa  she had arrived the night before after dark and we were
preparing to pay our first visit ashore  early in the morning i had
noticed a tiny outrigger canoe with an impossible spritsail skimming
the surface of the lagoon  the canoe itself was coffin-shaped a mere
dugout fourteen feet long a scant twelve inches wide and maybe
twenty-four inches deep  it had no lines except in so far that it was
sharp at both ends  its sides were perpendicular  shorn of the
outrigger it would have capsized of itself inside a tenth of a second
it was the outrigger that kept it right side up

i have said that the sail was impossible  it was  it was one of those
things not that you have to see to believe but that you cannot believe
after you have seen it  the hoist of it and the length of its boom were
sufficiently appalling but not content with that its artificer had
given it a tremendous head  so large was the head that no common sprit
could carry the strain of it in an ordinary breeze  so a spar had been
lashed to the canoe projecting aft over the water  to this had been
made fast a sprit guy thus the foot of the sail was held by the
main-sheet and the peak by the guy to the sprit

it was not a mere boat not a mere canoe but a sailing machine  and the
man in it sailed it by his weight and his nerve—principally by the
latter  i watched the canoe beat up from leeward and run in toward the
village its sole occupant far out on the outrigger and luffing up and
spilling the wind in the puffs

“well i know one thing” i announced “i dont leave raiatea till i have
a ride in that canoe”

a few minutes later warren called down the companionway “heres that
canoe you were talking about”

promptly i dashed on deck and gave greeting to its owner a tall slender
polynesian ingenuous of face and with clear sparkling intelligent
eyes  he was clad in a scarlet loin-cloth and a straw hat  in his hands
were presents—a fish a bunch of greens and several enormous yams  all
of which acknowledged by smiles (which are coinage still in isolated
spots of polynesia) and by frequent repetitions of mauruuru (which is
the tahitian “thank you”) i proceeded to make signs that i desired to go
for a sail in his canoe

his face lighted with pleasure and he uttered the single word “tahaa”
turning at the same time and pointing to the lofty cloud-draped peaks of
an island three miles away—the island of tahaa  it was fair wind over
but a head-beat back  now i did not want to go to tahaa  i had letters
to deliver in raiatea and officials to see and there was charmian down
below getting ready to go ashore  by insistent signs i indicated that i
desired no more than a short sail on the lagoon  quick was the
disappointment in his face yet smiling was the acquiescence

“come on for a sail” i called below to charmian  “but put on your
swimming suit  its going to be wet”

it wasnt real  it was a dream  that canoe slid over the water like a
streak of silver  i climbed out on the outrigger and supplied the weight
to hold her down while tehei (pronounced tayhayee) supplied the nerve
he too in the puffs climbed part way out on the outrigger at the same
time steering with both hands on a large paddle and holding the mainsheet
with his foot

“ready about” he called

i carefully shifted my weight inboard in order to maintain the
equilibrium as the sail emptied

“hard a-lee” he called shooting her into the wind

i slid out on the opposite side over the water on a spar lashed across
the canoe and we were full and away on the other tack

“all right” said tehei

those three phrases “ready about” “hard a-lee” and “all right”
comprised teheis english vocabulary and led me to suspect that at some
time he had been one of a kanaka crew under an american captain  between
the puffs i made signs to him and repeatedly and interrogatively uttered
the word sailor  then i tried it in atrocious french  marin
conveyed no meaning to him nor did matelot  either my french was bad
or else he was not up in it  i have since concluded that both
conjectures were correct  finally i began naming over the adjacent
islands  he nodded that he had been to them  by the time my quest
reached tahiti he caught my drift  his thought-processes were almost
visible and it was a joy to watch him think  he nodded his head
vigorously  yes he had been to tahiti and he added himself names of
islands such as tikihau rangiroa and fakarava thus proving that he had
sailed as far as the paumotus—undoubtedly one of the crew of a trading
schooner

after our short sail when he had returned on board he by signs inquired
the destination of the snark and when i had mentioned samoa fiji new
guinea france england and california in their geographical sequence
he said “samoa” and by gestures intimated that he wanted to go along
whereupon i was hard put to explain that there was no room for him
“petit bateau” finally solved it and again the disappointment in his
face was accompanied by smiling acquiescence and promptly came the
renewed invitation to accompany him to tahaa

charmian and i looked at each other  the exhilaration of the ride we had
taken was still upon us  forgotten were the letters to raiatea the
officials we had to visit  shoes a shirt a pair of trousers
cigarettes matches and a book to read were hastily crammed into a
biscuit tin and wrapped in a rubber blanket and we were over the side
and into the canoe

“when shall we look for you?” warren called as the wind filled the sail
and sent tehei and me scurrying out on the outrigger

“i dont know” i answered  “when we get back as near as i can figure
it”

and away we went  the wind had increased and with slacked sheets we ran
off before it  the freeboard of the canoe was no more than two and a
half inches and the little waves continually lapped over the side  this
required bailing  now bailing is one of the principal functions of the
vahine  vahine is the tahitian for woman and charmian being the only
vahine aboard the bailing fell appropriately to her  tehei and i could
not very well do it the both of us being perched part way out on the
outrigger and busied with keeping the canoe bottom-side down  so
charmian bailed with a wooden scoop of primitive design and so well did
she do it that there were occasions when she could rest off almost half
the time

raiatea and tahaa are unique in that they lie inside the same encircling
reef  both are volcanic islands ragged of sky-line with
heaven-aspiring peaks and minarets  since raiatea is thirty miles in
circumference and tahaa fifteen miles some idea may be gained of the
magnitude of the reef that encloses them  between them and the reef
stretches from one to two miles of water forming a beautiful lagoon
the huge pacific seas extending in unbroken lines sometimes a mile or
half as much again in length hurl themselves upon the reef overtowering
and falling upon it with tremendous crashes and yet the fragile coral
structure withstands the shock and protects the land  outside lies
destruction to the mightiest ship afloat  inside reigns the calm of
untroubled water whereon a canoe like ours can sail with no more than a
couple of inches of free-board

we flew over the water  and such water—clear as the clearest
spring-water and crystalline in its clearness all intershot with a
maddening pageant of colours and rainbow ribbons more magnificently
gorgeous than any rainbow  jade green alternated with turquoise peacock
blue with emerald while now the canoe skimmed over reddish purple pools
and again over pools of dazzling shimmering white where pounded coral
sand lay beneath and upon which oozed monstrous sea-slugs  one moment we
were above wonder-gardens of coral wherein coloured fishes disported
fluttering like marine butterflies the next moment we were dashing
across the dark surface of deep channels out of which schools of flying
fish lifted their silvery flight and a third moment we were above other
gardens of living coral each more wonderful than the last  and above
all was the tropic trade-wind sky with its fluffy clouds racing across
the zenith and heaping the horizon with their soft masses

before we were aware we were close in to tahaa (pronounced tah-hah-ah
with equal accents) and tehei was grinning approval of the vahines
proficiency at bailing  the canoe grounded on a shallow shore twenty
feet from land and we waded out on a soft bottom where big slugs curled
and writhed under our feet and where small octopuses advertised their
existence by their superlative softness when stepped upon  close to the
beach amid cocoanut palms and banana trees erected on stilts built of
bamboo with a grass-thatched roof was teheis house  and out of the
house came teheis vahine a slender mite of a woman kindly eyed and
mongolian of feature—when she was not north american indian  “bihaura”
tehei called her but he did not pronounce it according to english
notions of spelling  spelled “bihaura” it sounded like bee-ah-oo-rah
with every syllable sharply emphasized

she took charmian by the hand and led her into the house leaving tehei
and me to follow  here by sign-language unmistakable we were informed
that all they possessed was ours  no hidalgo was ever more generous in
the expression of giving while i am sure that few hidalgos were ever as
generous in the actual practice  we quickly discovered that we dare not
admire their possessions for whenever we did admire a particular object
it was immediately presented to us  the two vahines according to the
way of vahines got together in a discussion and examination of feminine
fripperies while tehei and i manlike went over fishing-tackle and
wild-pig-hunting to say nothing of the device whereby bonitas are caught
on forty-foot poles from double canoes  charmian admired a sewing
basket—the best example she had seen of polynesian basketry it was hers
i admired a bonita hook carved in one piece from a pearl-shell it was
mine  charmian was attracted by a fancy braid of straw sennit thirty
feet of it in a roll sufficient to make a hat of any design one wished
the roll of sennit was hers  my gaze lingered upon a poi-pounder that
dated back to the old stone days it was mine  charmian dwelt a moment
too long on a wooden poi-bowl canoe-shaped with four legs all carved
in one piece of wood it was hers  i glanced a second time at a gigantic
cocoanut calabash it was mine  then charmian and i held a conference in
which we resolved to admire no more—not because it did not pay well
enough but because it paid too well  also we were already racking our
brains over the contents of the snark for suitable return presents
christmas is an easy problem compared with a polynesian giving-feast

we sat on the cool porch on bihauras best mats while dinner was
preparing and at the same time met the villagers  in twos and threes
and groups they strayed along shaking hands and uttering the tahitian
word of greeting—ioarana pronounced yo-rah-nah  the men big strapping
fellows were in loin-cloths with here and there no shirt while the
women wore the universal ahu a sort of adult pinafore that flows in
graceful lines from the shoulders to the ground  sad to see was the
elephantiasis that afflicted some of them  here would be a comely woman
of magnificent proportions with the port of a queen yet marred by one
arm four times—or a dozen times—the size of the other  beside her might
stand a six-foot man erect mighty-muscled bronzed with the body of a
god yet with feet and calves so swollen that they ran together forming
legs shapeless monstrous that were for all the world like elephant
legs

no one seems really to know the cause of the south sea elephantiasis
one theory is that it is caused by the drinking of polluted water
another theory attributes it to inoculation through mosquito bites  a
third theory charges it to predisposition plus the process of
acclimatization  on the other hand no one that stands in finicky dread
of it and similar diseases can afford to travel in the south seas  there
will be occasions when such a one must drink water  there may be also
occasions when the mosquitoes let up biting  but every precaution of the
finicky one will be useless  if he runs barefoot across the beach to
have a swim he will tread where an elephantiasis case trod a few minutes
before  if he closets himself in his own house yet every bit of fresh
food on his table will have been subjected to the contamination be it
flesh fish fowl or vegetable  in the public market at papeete two
known lepers run stalls and heaven alone knows through what channels
arrive at that market the daily supplies of fish fruit meat and
vegetables  the only happy way to go through the south seas is with a
careless poise without apprehension and with a christian science-like
faith in the resplendent fortune of your own particular star  when you
see a woman afflicted with elephantiasis wringing out cream from
cocoanut meat with her naked hands drink and reflect how good is the
cream forgetting the hands that pressed it out  also remember that
diseases such as elephantiasis and leprosy do not seem to be caught by
contact

we watched a raratongan woman with swollen distorted limbs prepare our
cocoanut cream and then went out to the cook-shed where tehei and
bihaura were cooking dinner  and then it was served to us on a dry-goods
box in the house  our hosts waited until we were done and then spread
their table on the floor  but our table  we were certainly in the high
seat of abundance  first there was glorious raw fish caught several
hours before from the sea and steeped the intervening time in lime-juice
diluted with water  then came roast chicken  two cocoanuts sharply
sweet served for drink  there were bananas that tasted like
strawberries and that melted in the mouth and there was banana-poi that
made one regret that his yankee forebears ever attempted puddings  then
there was boiled yam boiled taro and roasted feis which last are
nothing more or less than large mealy juicy red-coloured cooking
bananas  we marvelled at the abundance and even as we marvelled a pig
was brought on a whole pig a sucking pig swathed in green leaves and
roasted upon the hot stones of a native oven the most honourable and
triumphant dish in the polynesian cuisine  and after that came coffee
black coffee delicious coffee native coffee grown on the hillsides of
tahaa

teheis fishing-tackle fascinated me and after we arranged to go
fishing charmian and i decided to remain all night  again tehei
broached samoa and again my petit bateau brought the disappointment
and the smile of acquiescence to his face  bora bora was my next port
it was not so far away but that cutters made the passage back and forth
between it and raiatea  so i invited tehei to go that far with us on the
snark  then i learned that his wife had been born on bora bora and
still owned a house there  she likewise was invited and immediately
came the counter invitation to stay with them in their house in born
bora  it was monday  tuesday we would go fishing and return to raiatea
wednesday we would sail by tahaa and off a certain point a mile away
pick up tehei and bihaura and go on to bora bora  all this we arranged
in detail and talked over scores of other things as well and yet tehei
knew three phrases in english charmian and i knew possibly a dozen
tahitian words and among the four of us there were a dozen or so french
words that all understood  of course such polyglot conversation was
slow but eked out with a pad a lead pencil the face of a clock
charmian drew on the back of a pad and with ten thousand and one
gestures we managed to get on very nicely

at the first moment we evidenced an inclination for bed the visiting
natives with soft iaoranas faded away and tehei and bihaura likewise
faded away  the house consisted of one large room and it was given over
to us our hosts going elsewhere to sleep  in truth their castle was
ours  and right here i want to say that of all the entertainment i have
received in this world at the hands of all sorts of races in all sorts of
places i have never received entertainment that equalled this at the
hands of this brown-skinned couple of tahaa  i do not refer to the
presents the free-handed generousness the high abundance but to the
fineness of courtesy and consideration and tact and to the sympathy that
was real sympathy in that it was understanding  they did nothing they
thought ought to be done for us according to their standards but they
did what they divined we waited to be done for us while their divination
was most successful  it would be impossible to enumerate the hundreds of
little acts of consideration they performed during the few days of our
intercourse  let it suffice for me to say that of all hospitality and
entertainment i have known in no case was theirs not only not excelled
but in no case was it quite equalled  perhaps the most delightful
feature of it was that it was due to no training to no complex social
ideals but that it was the untutored and spontaneous outpouring from
their hearts

the next morning we went fishing that is tehei charmian and i did in
the coffin-shaped canoe but this time the enormous sail was left behind
there was no room for sailing and fishing at the same time in that tiny
craft  several miles away inside the reef in a channel twenty fathoms
deep tehei dropped his baited hooks and rock-sinkers  the bait was
chunks of octopus flesh which he bit out of a live octopus that writhed
in the bottom of the canoe  nine of these lines he set each line
attached to one end of a short length of bamboo floating on the surface
when a fish was hooked the end of the bamboo was drawn under the water
naturally the other end rose up in the air bobbing and waving
frantically for us to make haste  and make haste we did with whoops and
yells and driving paddles from one signalling bamboo to another hauling
up from the depths great glistening beauties from two to three feet in
length

steadily to the eastward an ominous squall had been rising and blotting
out the bright trade-wind sky  and we were three miles to leeward of
home  we started as the first wind-gusts whitened the water  then came
the rain such rain as only the tropics afford where every tap and main
in the sky is open wide and when to top it all the very reservoir
itself spills over in blinding deluge  well charmian was in a swimming
suit i was in pyjamas and tehei wore only a loin-cloth  bihaura was on
the beach waiting for us and she led charmian into the house in much the
same fashion that the mother leads in the naughty little girl who has
been playing in mud-puddles

it was a change of clothes and a dry and quiet smoke while kai-kai was
preparing  kai-kai by the way is the polynesian for “food” or “to
eat” or rather it is one form of the original root whatever it may
have been that has been distributed far and wide over the vast area of
the pacific  it is kai in the marquesas raratonga manahiki niuë
fakaafo tonga new zealand and vaté  in tahiti “to eat” changes to
amu in hawaii and samoa to ai in ban to kana in nina to kana
in nongone to kaka and in new caledonia to ki  but by whatsoever
sound or symbol it was welcome to our ears after that long paddle in the
rain  once more we sat in the high seat of abundance until we regretted
that we had been made unlike the image of the giraffe and the camel

again when we were preparing to return to the snark the sky to
windward turned black and another squall swooped down  but this time it
was little rain and all wind  it blew hour after hour moaning and
screeching through the palms tearing and wrenching and shaking the frail
bamboo dwelling while the outer reef set no a mighty thundering as it
broke the force of the swinging seas  inside the reef the lagoon
sheltered though it was was white with fury and not even teheis
seamanship could have enabled his slender canoe to live in such a welter

by sunset the back of the squall had broken though it was still too
rough for the canoe  so i had tehei find a native who was willing to
venture his cutter across to raiatea for the outrageous sum of two
dollars chili which is equivalent in our money to ninety cents  half
the village was told off to carry presents with which tehei and bihaura
speeded their parting guests—captive chickens fishes dressed and swathed
in wrappings of green leaves great golden bunches of bananas leafy
baskets spilling over with oranges and limes alligator pears (the
butter-fruit also called the avoca) huge baskets of yams bunches of
taro and cocoanuts and last of all large branches and trunks of
trees—firewood for the snark

while on the way to the cutter we met the only white man on tahaa and of
all men george lufkin a native of new england  eighty-six years of age
he was sixty-odd of which he said he had spent in the society islands
with occasional absences such as the gold rush to eldorado in
forty-nine and a short period of ranching in california near tulare
given no more than three months by the doctors to live he had returned
to his south seas and lived to eighty-six and to chuckle over the doctors
aforesaid who were all in their graves  fee-fee he had which is the
native for elephantiasis and which is pronounced fay-fay  a quarter of a
century before the disease had fastened upon him and it would remain
with him until he died  we asked him about kith and kin  beside him sat
a sprightly damsel of sixty his daughter  “she is all i have” he
murmured plaintively “and she has no children living”

the cutter was a small sloop-rigged affair but large it seemed
alongside teheis canoe  on the other hand when we got out on the
lagoon and were struck by another heavy wind-squall the cutter became
liliputian while the snark in our imagination seemed to promise all
the stability and permanence of a continent  they were good boatmen
tehei and bihaura had come along to see us home and the latter proved a
good boatwoman herself  the cutter was well ballasted and we met the
squall under full sail  it was getting dark the lagoon was full of
coral patches and we were carrying on  in the height of the squall we
had to go about in order to make a short leg to windward to pass around
a patch of coral no more than a foot under the surface  as the cutter
filled on the other tack and while she was in that “dead” condition that
precedes gathering way she was knocked flat  jib-sheet and main-sheet
were let go and she righted into the wind  three times she was knocked
down and three times the sheets were flung loose before she could get
away on that tack

by the time we went about again darkness had fallen  we were now to
windward of the snark and the squall was howling  in came the jib
and down came the mainsail all but a patch of it the size of a
pillow-slip  by an accident we missed the snark which was riding it
out to two anchors and drove aground upon the inshore coral  running
the longest line on the snark by means of the launch and after an
hours hard work we heaved the cutter off and had her lying safely
astern

the day we sailed for bora bora the wind was light and we crossed the
lagoon under power to the point where tehei and bihaura were to meet us
as we made in to the land between the coral banks we vainly scanned the
shore for our friends  there was no sign of them

“we cant wait” i said  “this breeze wont fetch us to bora bora by
dark and i dont want to use any more gasolene than i have to”

you see gasolene in the south seas is a problem  one never knows when
he will be able to replenish his supply

but just then tehei appeared through the trees as he came down to the
water  he had peeled off his shirt and was wildly waving it  bihaura
apparently was not ready  once aboard tehei informed us by signs that
we must proceed along the land till we got opposite to his house  he
took the wheel and conned the snark through the coral around point
after point till we cleared the last point of all  cries of welcome went
up from the beach and bihaura assisted by several of the villagers
brought off two canoe-loads of abundance  there were yams taro feis
breadfruit cocoanuts oranges limes pineapples watermelons alligator
pears pomegranates fish chickens galore crowing and cackling and
laying eggs on our decks and a live pig that squealed infernally and all
the time in apprehension of imminent slaughter

under the rising moon we came in through the perilous passage of the reef
of bora bora and dropped anchor off vaitapé village  bihaura with
housewifely anxiety could not get ashore too quickly to her house to
prepare more abundance for us  while the launch was taking her and tehei
to the little jetty the sound of music and of singing drifted across the
quiet lagoon  throughout the society islands we had been continually
informed that we would find the bora borans very jolly  charmian and i
went ashore to see and on the village green by forgotten graves on the
beach found the youths and maidens dancing flower-garlanded and
flower-bedecked with strange phosphorescent flowers in their hair that
pulsed and dimmed and glowed in the moonlight  farther along the beach
we came upon a huge grass house oval-shaped seventy feet in length
where the elders of the village were singing himines  they too were
flower-garlanded and jolly and they welcomed us into the fold as little
lost sheep straying along from outer darkness

early next morning tehei was on board with a string of fresh-caught fish
and an invitation to dinner for that evening  on the way to dinner we
dropped in at the himine house  the same elders were singing with
here or there a youth or maiden that we had not seen the previous night
from all the signs a feast was in preparation  towering up from the
floor was a mountain of fruits and vegetables flanked on either side by
numerous chickens tethered by cocoanut strips  after several himines
had been sung one of the men arose and made oration  the oration was
made to us and though it was greek to us we knew that in some way it
connected us with that mountain of provender

“can it be that they are presenting us with all that?” charmian
whispered

“impossible” i muttered back  “why should they be giving it to us?
besides there is no room on the snark for it  we could not eat a
tithe of it  the rest would spoil  maybe they are inviting us to the
feast  at any rate that they should give all that to us is impossible”

nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance
the orator by gestures unmistakable in detail presented every item in
the mountain to us and next he presented it to us in toto  it was an
embarrassing moment  what would you do if you lived in a hall bedroom
and a friend gave you a white elephant?  our snark was no more than a
hall bedroom and already she was loaded down with the abundance of
tahaa  this new supply was too much  we blushed and stammered and
mauruurud  we mauruurud with repeated nuis which conveyed the
largeness and overwhelmingness of our thanks  at the same time by
signs we committed the awful breach of etiquette of not accepting the
present  the himine singers disappointment was plainly betrayed and
that evening aided by tehei we compromised by accepting one chicken
one bunch of bananas one bunch of taro and so on down the list

but there was no escaping the abundance  i bought a dozen chickens from
a native out in the country and the following day he delivered thirteen
chickens along with a canoe-load of fruit  the french storekeeper
presented us with pomegranates and lent us his finest horse  the
gendarme did likewise lending us a horse that was the very apple of his
eye  and everybody sent us flowers  the snark was a fruit-stand and a
greengrocers shop masquerading under the guise of a conservatory  we
went around flower-garlanded all the time  when the himine singers
came on board to sing the maidens kissed us welcome and the crew from
captain to cabin-boy lost its heart to the maidens of bora bora  tehei
got up a big fishing expedition in our honour to which we went in a
double canoe paddled by a dozen strapping amazons  we were relieved
that no fish were caught else the snark would have sunk at her
moorings

the days passed but the abundance did not diminish  on the day of
departure canoe after canoe put off to us  tehei brought cucumbers and
a young papaia tree burdened with splendid fruit  also for me he
brought a tiny double canoe with fishing apparatus complete  further
he brought fruits and vegetables with the same lavishness as at tahaa
bihaura brought various special presents for charmian such as
silk-cotton pillows fans and fancy mats  the whole population brought
fruits flowers and chickens  and bihaura added a live sucking pig
natives whom i did not remember ever having seen before strayed over the
rail and presented me with such things as fish-poles fish-lines and
fish-hooks carved from pearl-shell

as the snark sailed out through the reef she had a cutter in tow
this was the craft that was to take bihaura back to tahaa—but not tehei
i had yielded at last and he was one of the crew of the snark  when
the cutter cast off and headed east and the snarks bow turned toward
the west tehei knelt down by the cockpit and breathed a silent prayer
the tears flowing down his cheeks  a week later when martin got around
to developing and printing he showed tehei some of the photographs  and
that brown-skinned son of polynesia gazing on the pictured lineaments of
his beloved bihaura broke down in tears

but the abundance  there was so much of it  we could not work the
snark for the fruit that was in the way  she was festooned with fruit
the life-boat and launch were packed with it  the awning-guys groaned
under their burdens  but once we struck the full trade-wind sea the
disburdening began  at every roll the snark shook overboard a bunch or
so of bananas and cocoanuts or a basket of limes  a golden flood of
limes washed about in the lee-scuppers  the big baskets of yams burst
and pineapples and pomegranates rolled back and forth  the chickens had
got loose and were everywhere roosting on the awnings fluttering and
squawking out on the jib-boom and essaying the perilous feat of
balancing on the spinnaker-boom  they were wild chickens accustomed to
flight  when attempts were made to catch them they flew out over the
ocean circled about and came lack  sometimes they did not come back
and in the confusion unobserved the little sucking pig got loose and
slipped overboard

“on the arrival of strangers every man endeavoured to obtain one as a
friend and carry him off to his own habitation where he is treated with
the greatest kindness by the inhabitants of the district they place him
on a high seat and feed him with abundance of the finest foods”




chapter xiii
the stone-fishing of bora bora


at five in the morning the conches began to blow  from all along the
beach the eerie sounds arose like the ancient voice of war calling to
the fishermen to arise and prepare to go forth  we on the snark
likewise arose for there could be no sleep in that mad din of conches
also we were going stone-fishing though our preparations were few

tautai-taora is the name for stone-fishing tautai meaning a “fishing
instrument”  and taora meaning “thrown”  but tautai-taora in
combination means “stone-fishing” for a stone is the instrument that is
thrown  stone-fishing is in reality a fish-drive similar in principle
to a rabbit-drive or a cattle-drive though in the latter affairs drivers
and driven operate in the same medium while in the fish-drive the men
must be in the air to breathe and the fish are driven through the water
it does not matter if the water is a hundred feet deep the men working
on the surface drive the fish just the same

this is the way it is done  the canoes form in line one hundred to two
hundred feet apart  in the bow of each canoe a man wields a stone
several pounds in weight which is attached to a short rope  he merely
smites the water with the stone pulls up the stone and smites again
he goes on smiting  in the stern of each canoe another man paddles
driving the canoe ahead and at the same time keeping it in the formation
the line of canoes advances to meet a second line a mile or two away the
ends of the lines hurrying together to form a circle the far edge of
which is the shore  the circle begins to contract upon the shore where
the women standing in a long row out into the sea form a fence of legs
which serves to break any rushes of the frantic fish  at the right
moment when the circle is sufficiently small a canoe dashes out from
shore dropping overboard a long screen of cocoanut leaves and encircling
the circle thus reinforcing the palisade of legs  of course the
fishing is always done inside the reef in the lagoon

“très jolie” the gendarme said after explaining by signs and gestures
that thousands of fish would be caught of all sizes from minnows to
sharks and that the captured fish would boil up and upon the very sand
of the beach

it is a most successful method of fishing while its nature is more that
of an outing festival rather than of a prosaic food-getting task  such
fishing parties take place about once a month at bora bora and it is a
custom that has descended from old time  the man who originated it is
not remembered  they always did this thing  but one cannot help
wondering about that forgotten savage of the long ago into whose mind
first flashed this scheme of easy fishing of catching huge quantities of
fish without hook or net or spear  one thing about him we can know he
was a radical  and we can be sure that he was considered feather-brained
and anarchistic by his conservative tribesmen  his difficulty was much
greater than that of the modern inventor who has to convince in advance
only one or two capitalists  that early inventor had to convince his
whole tribe in advance for without the co-operation of the whole tribe
the device could not be tested  one can well imagine the nightly
pow-wow-ings in that primitive island world when he called his comrades
antiquated moss-backs and they called him a fool a freak and a crank
and charged him with having come from kansas  heaven alone knows at what
cost of grey hairs and expletives he must finally have succeeded in
winning over a sufficient number to give his idea a trial  at any rate
the experiment succeeded  it stood the test of truth—it worked  and
thereafter we can be confident there was no man to be found who did not
know all along that it was going to work

our good friends tehei and bihaura who were giving the fishing in our
honour had promised to come for us  we were down below when the call
came from on deck that they were coming  we dashed up the companionway
to be overwhelmed by the sight of the polynesian barge in which we were
to ride  it was a long double canoe the canoes lashed together by
timbers with an interval of water between and the whole decorated with
flowers and golden grasses  a dozen flower-crowned amazons were at the
paddles while at the stern of each canoe was a strapping steersman  all
were garlanded with gold and crimson and orange flowers while each wore
about the hips a scarlet pareu  there were flowers everywhere
flowers flowers flowers without out end  the whole thing was an orgy
of colour  on the platform forward resting on the bows of the canoes
tehei and bihaura were dancing  all voices were raised in a wild song or
greeting

three times they circled the snark before coming alongside to take
charmian and me on board  then it was away for the fishing-grounds a
five-mile paddle dead to windward  “everybody is jolly in bora bora” is
the saying throughout the society islands and we certainly found
everybody jolly  canoe songs shark songs and fishing songs were sung
to the dipping of the paddles all joining in on the swinging choruses
once in a while the cry mao was raised whereupon all strained like
mad at the paddles  mao is shark and when the deep-sea tigers appear
the natives paddle for dear life for the shore knowing full well the
danger they run of having their frail canoes overturned and of being
devoured  of course in our case there were no sharks but the cry of
mao was used to incite them to paddle with as much energy as if a shark
were really after them  “hoé  hoé” was another cry that made us foam
through the water

on the platform tehei and bihaura danced accompanied by songs and
choruses or by rhythmic hand-clappings  at other times a musical
knocking of the paddles against the sides of the canoes marked the
accent  a young girl dropped her paddle leaped to the platform and
danced a hula in the midst of which still dancing she swayed and bent
and imprinted on our cheeks the kiss of welcome  some of the songs or
himines were religious and they were especially beautiful the deep
basses of the men mingling with the altos and thin sopranos of the women
and forming a combination of sound that irresistibly reminded one of an
organ  in fact “kanaka organ” is the scoffers description of the
himine  on the other hand some of the chants or ballads were very
barbaric having come down from pre-christian times

and so singing dancing paddling these joyous polynesians took us to
the fishing  the gendarme who is the french ruler of bora bora
accompanied us with his family in a double canoe of his own paddled by
his prisoners for not only is he gendarme and ruler but he is jailer as
well and in this jolly land when anybody goes fishing all go fishing
a score of single canoes with outriggers paddled along with us  around
a point a big sailing-canoe appeared running beautifully before the wind
as it bore down to greet us  balancing precariously on the outrigger
three young men saluted us with a wild rolling of drums

the next point half a mile farther on brought us to the place of
meeting  here the launch which had been brought along by warren and
martin attracted much attention  the bora borans could not see what
made it go  the canoes were drawn upon the sand and all hands went
ashore to drink cocoanuts and sing and dance  here our numbers were
added to by many who arrived on foot from near-by dwellings and a pretty
sight it was to see the flower-crowned maidens hand in hand and two by
two arriving along the sands

“they usually make a big catch” allicot a half-caste trader told us
“at the finish the water is fairly alive with fish  it is lots of fun
of course you know all the fish will be yours”

“all?” i groaned for already the snark was loaded down with lavish
presents by the canoe-load of fruits vegetables pigs and chickens

“yes every last fish” allicot answered  “you see when the surround is
completed you being the guest of honour must take a harpoon and impale
the first one  it is the custom  then everybody goes in with their
hands and throws the catch out on the sand  there will be a mountain of
them  then one of the chiefs will make a speech in which he presents you
with the whole kit and boodle  but you dont have to take them all  you
get up and make a speech selecting what fish you want for yourself and
presenting all the rest back again  then everybody says you are very
generous”

“but what would be the result if i kept the whole present?” i asked

“it has never happened” was the answer  “it is the custom to give and
give back again”

the native minister started with a prayer for success in the fishing and
all heads were bared  next the chief fishermen told off the canoes and
allotted them their places  then it was into the canoes and away  no
women however came along with the exception of bihaura and charmian
in the old days even they would have been tabooed  the women remained
behind to wade out into the water and form the palisade of legs

the big double canoe was left on the beech and we went in the launch
half the canoes paddled off to leeward while we with the other half
headed to windward a mile and a half until the end of our line was in
touch with the reef  the leader of the drive occupied a canoe midway in
our line  he stood erect a fine figure of an old man holding a flag in
his hand  he directed the taking of positions and the forming of the two
lines by blowing on a conch  when all was ready he waved his flag to
the right  with a single splash the throwers in every canoe on that side
struck the water with their stones  while they were hauling them back—a
matter of a moment for the stones scarcely sank beneath the surface—the
flag waved to the left and with admirable precision every stone on that
side struck the water  so it went back and forth right and left with
every wave of the flag a long line of concussion smote the lagoon  at
the same time the paddles drove the canoes forward and what was being
done in our line was being done in the opposing line of canoes a mile and
more away

on the bow of the launch tehei with eyes fixed on the leader worked
his stone in unison with the others  once the stone slipped from the
rope and the same instant tehei went overboard after it  i do not know
whether or not that stone reached the bottom but i do know that the next
instant tehei broke surface alongside with the stone in his hand  i
noticed this same accident occur several times among the near-by canoes
but in each instance the thrower followed the stone and brought it back

the reef ends of our lines accelerated the shore ends lagged all under
the watchful supervision of the leader until at the reef the two lines
joined forming the circle  then the contraction of the circle began
the poor frightened fish harried shoreward by the streaks of concussion
that smote the water  in the same fashion elephants are driven through
the jungle by motes of men who crouch in the long grasses or behind trees
and make strange noises  already the palisade of legs had been built
we could see the heads of the women in a long line dotting the placid
surface of the lagoon  the tallest women went farthest out thus with
the exception of those close inshore nearly all were up to their necks
in the water

still the circle narrowed till canoes were almost touching  there was a
pause  a long canoe shot out from shore following the line of the
circle  it went as fast as paddles could drive  in the stern a man
threw overboard the long continuous screen of cocoanut leaves  the
canoes were no longer needed and overboard went the men to reinforce the
palisade with their legs  for the screen was only a screen and not a
net and the fish could dash through it if they tried  hence the need
for legs that ever agitated the screen and for hands that splashed and
throats that yelled  pandemonium reigned as the trap tightened

but no fish broke surface or collided against the hidden legs  at last
the chief fisherman entered the trap  he waded around everywhere
carefully  but there were no fish boiling up and out upon the sand
there was not a sardine not a minnow not a polly-wog  something must
have been wrong with that prayer or else and more likely as one
grizzled fellow put it the wind was not in its usual quarter and the
fish were elsewhere in the lagoon  in fact there had been no fish to
drive

“about once in five these drives are failures” allicot consoled us

well it was the stone-fishing that had brought us to bora bora and it
was our luck to draw the one chance in five  had it been a raffle it
would have been the other way about  this is not pessimism  nor is it
an indictment of the plan of the universe  it is merely that feeling
which is familiar to most fishermen at the empty end of a hard day




chapter xiv
the amateur navigator


there are captains and captains and some mighty fine captains i know
but the run of the captains on the snark has been remarkably otherwise
my experience with them has been that it is harder to take care of one
captain on a small boat than of two small babies  of course this is no
more than is to be expected  the good men have positions and are not
likely to forsake their one-thousand-to-fifteen-thousand-ton billets for
the snark with her ten tons net  the snark has had to cull her
navigators from the beach and the navigator on the beach is usually a
congenital inefficient—the sort of man who beats about for a fortnight
trying vainly to find an ocean isle and who returns with his schooner to
report the island sunk with all on board the sort of man whose temper or
thirst for strong waters works him out of billets faster than he can work
into them

the snark has had three captains and by the grace of god she shall
have no more  the first captain was so senile as to be unable to give a
measurement for a boom-jaw to a carpenter  so utterly agedly helpless
was he that he was unable to order a sailor to throw a few buckets of
salt water on the snarks deck  for twelve days at anchor under an
overhead tropic sun the deck lay dry  it was a new deck  it cost me
one hundred and thirty-five dollars to recaulk it  the second captain
was angry  he was born angry  “papa is always angry” was the
description given him by his half-breed son  the third captain was so
crooked that he couldnt hide behind a corkscrew  the truth was not in
him common honesty was not in him and he was as far away from fair play
and square-dealing as he was from his proper course when he nearly
wrecked the snark on the ring-gold isles

it was at suva in the fijis that i discharged my third and last captain
and took up gain the rôle of amateur navigator  i had essayed it once
before under my first captain who out of san francisco jumped the
snark so amazingly over the chart that i really had to find out what
was doing  it was fairly easy to find out for we had a run of
twenty-one hundred miles before us  i knew nothing of navigation but
after several hours of reading up and half an hours practice with the
sextant i was able to find the snarks latitude by meridian
observation and her longitude by the simple method known as “equal
altitudes”  this is not a correct method  it is not even a safe method
but my captain was attempting to navigate by it and he was the only one
on board who should have been able to tell me that it was a method to be
eschewed  i brought the snark to hawaii but the conditions favoured
me  the sun was in northern declination and nearly overhead  the
legitimate “chronometer-sight” method of ascertaining the longitude i had
not heard of—yes i had heard of it  my first captain mentioned it
vaguely but after one or two attempts at practice of it he mentioned it
no more

i had time in the fijis to compare my chronometer with two other
chronometers  two weeks previous at pago pago in samoa i had asked my
captain to compare our chronometer with the chronometers on the american
cruiser the annapolis  this he told me he had done—of course he had
done nothing of the sort and he told me that the difference he had
ascertained was only a small fraction of a second  he told it to me with
finely simulated joy and with words of praise for my splendid
time-keeper  i repeat it now with words of praise for his splendid and
unblushing unveracity  for behold fourteen days later in suva i
compared the chronometer with the one on the atua an australian steamer
and found that mine was thirty-one seconds fast  now thirty-one seconds
of time converted into arc equals seven and one-quarter miles  that is
to say if i were sailing west in the night-time and my position
according to my dead reckoning from my afternoon chronometer sight was
shown to be seven miles off the land why at that very moment i would be
crashing on the reef  next i compared my chronometer with captain
wooleys  captain wooley the harbourmaster gives the time to suva
firing a gun signal at twelve noon three times a week  according to
his chronometer mine was fifty-nine seconds fast which is to say that
sailing west i should be crashing on the reef when i thought i was
fifteen miles off from it

i compromised by subtracting thirty-one seconds from the total of my
chronometers losing error and sailed away for tanna in the new
hebrides resolved when nosing around the land on dark nights to bear
in mind the other seven miles i might be out according to captain
wooleys instrument  tanna lay some six hundred miles west-southwest
from the fijis and it was my belief that while covering that distance i
could quite easily knock into my head sufficient navigation to get me
there  well i got there but listen first to my troubles  navigation
is easy i shall always contend that but when a man is taking three
gasolene engines and a wife around the world and is writing hard every
day to keep the engines supplied with gasolene and the wife with pearls
and volcanoes he hasnt much time left in which to study navigation
also it is bound to be easier to study said science ashore where
latitude and longitude are unchanging in a house whose position never
alters than it is to study navigation on a boat that is rushing along
day and night toward land that one is trying to find and which he is
liable to find disastrously at a moment when he least expects it

to begin with there are the compasses and the setting of the courses
we sailed from suva on saturday afternoon june 6 1908 and it took us
till after dark to run the narrow reef-ridden passage between the
islands of viti levu and mbengha  the open ocean lay before me  there
was nothing in the way with the exception of vatu leile a miserable
little island that persisted in poking up through the sea some twenty
miles to the west-southwest—just where i wanted to go  of course it
seemed quite simple to avoid it by steering a course that would pass it
eight or ten miles to the north  it was a black night and we were
running before the wind  the man at the wheel must be told what
direction to steer in order to miss vatu leile  but what direction?  i
turned me to the navigation books  “true course” i lighted upon  the
very thing  what i wanted was the true course  i read eagerly on

“the true course is the angle made with the meridian by a straight line
on the chart drawn to connect the ships position with the place bound
to”

just what i wanted  the snarks position was at the western entrance
of the passage between viti levu and mbengha  the immediate place she
was bound to was a place on the chart ten miles north of vatu leile  i
pricked that place off on the chart with my dividers and with my
parallel rulers found that west-by-south was the true course  i had but
to give it to the man at the wheel and the snark would win her way to
the safety of the open sea

but alas and alack and lucky for me i read on  i discovered that the
compass that trusty everlasting friend of the mariner was not given to
pointing north  it varied  sometimes it pointed east of north
sometimes west of north and on occasion it even turned tail on north and
pointed south  the variation at the particular spot on the globe
occupied by the snark was 9° 40′ easterly  well that had to be taken
in to account before i gave the steering course to the man at the wheel
i read

“the correct magnetic course is derived from the true course by applying
to it the variation”

therefore i reasoned if the compass points 9° 40′ eastward of north
and i wanted to sail due north i should have to steer 9° 40′ westward of
the north indicated by the compass and which was not north at all  so i
added 9° 40′ to the left of my west-by-south course thus getting my
correct magnetic course and was ready once more to run to open sea

again alas and alack  the correct magnetic course was not the compass
course  there was another sly little devil lying in wait to trip me up
and land me smashing on the reefs of vatu leile  this little devil went
by the name of deviation  i read

“the compass course is the course to steer and is derived from the
correct magnetic course by applying to it the deviation”

now deviation is the variation in the needle caused by the distribution
of iron on board of ship  this purely local variation i derived from the
deviation card of my standard compass and then applied to the correct
magnetic course  the result was the compass course  and yet not yet
my standard compass was amidships on the companionway  my steering
compass was aft in the cockpit near the wheel  when the steering
compass pointed west-by-south three-quarters-south (the steering course)
the standard compass pointed west-one-half-north which was certainly not
the steering course  i kept the snark up till she was heading
west-by-south-three-quarters-south on the standard compass which gave
on the steering compass south-west-by-west

the foregoing operations constitute the simple little matter of setting a
course  and the worst of it is that one must perform every step
correctly or else he will hear “breakers ahead” some pleasant night a
nice sea-bath and be given the delightful diversion of fighting his way
to the shore through a horde of man-eating sharks

just as the compass is tricky and strives to fool the mariner by pointing
in all directions except north so does that guide post of the sky the
sun persist in not being where it ought to be at a given time  this
carelessness of the sun is the cause of more trouble—at least it caused
trouble for me  to find out where one is on the earths surface he must
know at precisely the same time where the sun is in the heavens  that
is to say the sun which is the timekeeper for men doesnt run on time
when i discovered this i fell into deep gloom and all the cosmos was
filled with doubt  immutable laws such as gravitation and the
conservation of energy became wobbly and i was prepared to witness
their violation at any moment and to remain unastonished  for see if
the compass lied and the sun did not keep its engagements why should not
objects lose their mutual attraction and why should not a few bushel
baskets of force be annihilated?  even perpetual motion became possible
and i was in a frame of mind prone to purchase keeley-motor stock from
the first enterprising agent that landed on the snarks deck  and when
i discovered that the earth really rotated on its axis 366 times a year
while there were only 365 sunrises and sunsets i was ready to doubt my
own identity

this is the way of the sun  it is so irregular that it is impossible for
man to devise a clock that will keep the suns time  the sun accelerates
and retards as no clock could be made to accelerate and retard  the sun
is sometimes ahead of its schedule at other times it is lagging behind
and at still other times it is breaking the speed limit in order to
overtake itself or rather to catch up with where it ought to be in the
sky  in this last case it does not slow down quick enough and as a
result goes dashing ahead of where it ought to be  in fact only four
days in a year do the sun and the place where the sun ought to be happen
to coincide  the remaining 361 days the sun is pothering around all over
the shop  man being more perfect than the sun makes a clock that keeps
regular time  also he calculates how far the sun is ahead of its
schedule or behind  the difference between the suns position and the
position where the sun ought to be if it were a decent self-respecting
sun man calls the equation of time  thus the navigator endeavouring to
find his ships position on the sea looks in his chronometer to see
where precisely the sun ought to be according to the greenwich custodian
of the sun  then to that location he applies the equation of time and
finds out where the sun ought to be and isnt  this latter location
along with several other locations enables him to find out what the man
from kansas demanded to know some years ago

the snark sailed from fiji on saturday june 6 and the next day
sunday on the wide ocean out of sight of land i proceeded to endeavour
to find out my position by a chronometer sight for longitude and by a
meridian observation for latitude  the chronometer sight was taken in
the morning when the sun was some 21° above the horizon  i looked in the
nautical almanac and found that on that very day june 7 the sun was
behind time 1 minute and 26 seconds and that it was catching up at a
rate of 1467 seconds per hour  the chronometer said that at the precise
moment of taking the suns altitude it was twenty-five minutes after
eight oclock at greenwich  from this date it would seem a schoolboys
task to correct the equation of time  unfortunately i was not a
schoolboy  obviously at the middle of the day at greenwich the sun
was 1 minute and 26 seconds behind time  equally obviously if it were
eleven oclock in the morning the sun would be 1 minute and 26 seconds
behind time plus 1467 seconds  if it were ten oclock in the morning
twice 1467 seconds would have to be added  and if it were 8 25 in the
morning then 3½ times 1467 seconds would have to be added  quite
clearly then if instead of being 825 am it were 825 pm then 8½
times 1467 seconds would have to be not added but subtracted for
if at noon the sun were 1 minute and 26 seconds behind time and if it
were catching up with where it ought to be at the rate of 1467 seconds
per hour then at 825 pm it would be much nearer where it ought to be
than it had been at noon

so far so good  but was that 825 of the chronometer am or pm?  i
looked at the snarks clock  it marked 89 and it was certainly am
for i had just finished breakfast  therefore if it was eight in the
morning on board the snark the eight oclock of the chronometer (which
was the time of the day at greenwich) must be a different eight oclock
from the snarks eight oclock  but what eight oclock was it?  it
cant be the eight oclock of this morning i reasoned therefore it
must be either eight oclock this evening or eight oclock last night

it was at this juncture that i fell into the bottomless pit of
intellectual chaos  we are in east longitude i reasoned therefore we
are ahead of greenwich  if we are behind greenwich then to-day is
yesterday if we are ahead of greenwich then yesterday is to-day but if
yesterday is to-day what under the sun is to-day—to-morrow?  absurd
yet it must be correct  when i took the sun this morning at 825 the
suns custodians at greenwich were just arising from dinner last night

“then correct the equation of time for yesterday” says my logical mind

“but to-day is to-day” my literal mind insists  “i must correct the sun
for to-day and not for yesterday”

“yet to-day is yesterday” urges my logical mind

“thats all very well” my literal mind continues “if i were in
greenwich i might be in yesterday  strange things happen in greenwich
but i know as sure as i am living that i am here now in to-day june 7
and that i took the sun here now to-day june 7  therefore i must
correct the sun here now to-day june 7”

“bosh” snaps my logical mind  “lecky says—”

“never mind what lecky says” interrupts my literal mind  “let me tell
you what the nautical almanac says  the nautical almanac says that
to-day june 7 the sun was 1 minute and 26 seconds behind time and
catching up at the rate of 1467 seconds per hour  it says that
yesterday june 6 the sun was 1 minute and 36 seconds behind time and
catching up at the rate of 1566 seconds per hour  you see it is
preposterous to think of correcting to-days sun by yesterdays
time-table”

“fool”

“idiot”

back and forth they wrangle until my head is whirling around and i am
ready to believe that i am in the day after the last week before next

i remembered a parting caution of the suva harbour-master “in east
longitude take from the nautical almanac the elements for the preceding
day”

then a new thought came to me  i corrected the equation of time for
sunday and for saturday making two separate operations of it and lo
when the results were compared there was a difference only of
four-tenths of a second  i was a changed man  i had found my way out of
the crypt  the snark was scarcely big enough to hold me and my
experience  four-tenths of a second would make a difference of only
one-tenth of a mile—a cable-length

all went merrily for ten minutes when i chanced upon the following rhyme
for navigators

    “greenwich time least
    longitude east
    greenwich best
    longitude west”

heavens  the snarks time was not as good as greenwich time  when it
was 825 at greenwich on board the snark it was only 89  “greenwich
time best longitude west”  there i was  in west longitude beyond a
doubt

“silly” cries my literal mind  “you are 89 am and greenwich is 825
pm”

“very well” answers my logical mind  “to be correct 825 pm is
really twenty hours and twenty-five minutes and that is certainly better
than eight hours and nine minutes  no there is no discussion you are
in west longitude”

then my literal mind triumphs

“we sailed from suva in the fijis didnt we?” it demands and logical
mind agrees  “and suva is in east longitude?”  again logical mind
agrees  “and we sailed west (which would take us deeper into east
longitude) didnt we?  therefore and you cant escape it we are in
east longitude”

“greenwich time best longitude west” chants my logical mind “and you
must grant that twenty hours and twenty-five minutes is better than eight
hours and nine minutes”

“all right” i break in upon the squabble “well work up the sight and
then well see”

and work it up i did only to find that my longitude was 184° west

“i told you so” snorts my logical mind

i am dumbfounded  so is my literal mind for several minutes  then it
enounces

“but there is no 184° west longitude nor east longitude nor any other
longitude  the largest meridian is 180° as you ought to know very well”

having got this far literal mind collapses from the brain strain
logical mind is dumb flabbergasted and as for me i get a bleak and
wintry look in my eyes and go around wondering whether i am sailing
toward the china coast or the gulf of darien

then a thin small voice which i do not recognize coming from nowhere in
particular in my consciousness says

“the total number of degrees is 360  subtract the 184° west longitude
from 360° and you will get 176° east longitude”

“that is sheer speculation” objects literal mind and logical mind
remonstrates  “there is no rule for it”

“darn the rules” i exclaim  “aint i here?”

“the thing is self-evident” i continue  “184° west longitude means a
lapping over in east longitude of four degrees  besides i have been in
east longitude all the time  i sailed from fiji and fiji is in east
longitude  now i shall chart my position and prove it by dead
reckoning”

but other troubles and doubts awaited me  here is a sample of one  in
south latitude when the sun is in northern declination chronometer
sights may be taken early in the morning  i took mine at eight oclock
now one of the necessary elements in working up such a sight is
latitude  but one gets latitude at twelve oclock noon by a meridian
observation  it is clear that in order to work up my eight oclock
chronometer sight i must have my eight oclock latitude  of course if
the snark were sailing due west at six knots per hour for the
intervening four hours her latitude would not change  but if she were
sailing due south her latitude would change to the tune of twenty-four
miles  in which case a simple addition or subtraction would convert the
twelve oclock latitude into eight oclock latitude  but suppose the
snark were sailing southwest  then the traverse tables must be
consulted

this is the illustration  at eight am i took my chronometer sight  at
the same moment the distance recorded on the log was noted  at twelve
m when the sight for latitude was taken  i again noted the log which
showed me that since eight oclock the snark had run 24 miles  her
true course had been west ¾ south  i entered table i in the distance
column on the page for ¾ point courses and stopped at 24 the number of
miles run  opposite in the next two columns i found that the snark
had made 35 miles of southing or latitude and that she had made 237
miles of westing  to find my eight oclock latitude was easy  i had
but to subtract 35 miles from my noon latitude  all the elements being
present i worked up my longitude

but this was my eight oclock longitude  since then and up till noon i
had made 237 miles of westing  what was my noon longitude?  i followed
the rule turning to traverse table no ii  entering the table
according to rule and going through every detail according to rule i
found the difference of longitude for the four hours to be 25 miles  i
was aghast  i entered the table again according to rule i entered the
table half a dozen times according to rule and every time found that my
difference of longitude was 25 miles  i leave it to you gentle reader
suppose you had sailed 24 miles and that you had covered 35 miles of
latitude then how could you have covered 25 miles of longitude?  even if
you had sailed due west 24 miles and not changed your latitude how
could you have changed your longitude 25 miles?  in the name of human
reason how could you cover one mile more of longitude than the total
number of miles you had sailed?

it was a reputable traverse table being none other than bowditchs  the
rule was simple (as navigators rules go) i had made no error  i spent
an hour over it and at the end still faced the glaring impossibility of
having sailed 24 miles in the course of which i changed my latitude 35
miles and my longitude 25 miles  the worst of it was that there was
nobody to help me out  neither charmian nor martin knew as much as i
knew about navigation  and all the time the snark was rushing madly
along toward tanna in the new hebrides  something had to be done

how it came to me i know not—call it an inspiration if you will but the
thought arose in me if southing is latitude why isnt westing
longitude?  why should i have to change westing into longitude?  and then
the whole beautiful situation dawned upon me  the meridians of longitude
are 60 miles (nautical) apart at the equator  at the poles they run
together  thus if i should travel up the 180° meridian of longitude
until i reached the north pole and if the astronomer at greenwich
travelled up the 0 meridian of longitude to the north pole then at the
north pole we could shake hands with each other though before we
started for the north pole we had been some thousands of miles apart
again if a degree of longitude was 60 miles wide at the equator and if
the same degree at the point of the pole had no width then somewhere
between the pole and the equator that degree would be half a mile wide
and at other places a mile wide two miles wide ten miles wide thirty
miles wide ay and sixty miles wide

all was plain again  the snark was in 19° south latitude  the world
wasnt as big around there as at the equator  therefore every mile of
westing at 19° south was more than a minute of longitude for sixty miles
were sixty miles but sixty minutes are sixty miles only at the equator
george francis train broke jules vernes record of around the world  but
any man that wants can break george francis trains record  such a man
would need only to go in a fast steamer to the latitude of cape horn
and sail due east all the way around  the world is very small in that
latitude and there is no land in the way to turn him out of his course
if his steamer maintained sixteen knots he would circumnavigate the
globe in just about forty days

but there are compensations  on wednesday evening june 10 i brought up
my noon position by dead reckoning to eight pm  then i projected the
snarks course and saw that she would strike futuna one of the
easternmost of the new hebrides a volcanic cone two thousand feet high
that rose out of the deep ocean  i altered the course so that the
snark would pass ten miles to the northward  then i spoke to wada the
cook who had the wheel every morning from four to six

“wada san to-morrow morning your watch you look sharp on weather-bow
you see land”

and then i went to bed  the die was cast  i had staked my reputation as
a navigator  suppose just suppose that at daybreak there was no land
then where would my navigation be?  and where would we be?  and how
would we ever find ourselves? or find any land?  i caught ghastly visions
of the snark sailing for months through ocean solitudes and seeking
vainly for land while we consumed our provisions and sat down with
haggard faces to stare cannibalism in the face

i confess my sleep was not

    “    like a summer sky
    that held the music of a lark”

rather did “i waken to the voiceless dark” and listen to the creaking of
the bulkheads and the rippling of the sea alongside as the snark logged
steadily her six knots an hour  i went over my calculations again and
again striving to find some mistake until my brain was in such fever
that it discovered dozens of mistakes  suppose instead of being sixty
miles off futuna that my navigation was all wrong and that i was only
six miles off?  in which case my course would be wrong too and for all
i knew the snark might be running straight at futuna  for all i knew
the snark might strike futuna the next moment  i almost sprang from
the bunk at that thought and though i restrained myself i know that i
lay for a moment nervous and tense waiting for the shock

my sleep was broken by miserable nightmares  earthquake seemed the
favourite affliction though there was one man with a bill who
persisted in dunning me throughout the night  also he wanted to fight
and charmian continually persuaded me to let him alone  finally
however the man with the everlasting dun ventured into a dream from
which charmian was absent  it was my opportunity and we went at it
gloriously all over the sidewalk and street until he cried enough
then i said “now how about that bill?”  having conquered i was willing
to pay  but the man looked at me and groaned  “it was all a mistake”
he said “the bill is for the house next door”

that settled him for he worried my dreams no more and it settled me
too for i woke up chuckling at the episode  it was three in the
morning  i went up on deck  henry the rapa islander was steering  i
looked at the log  it recorded forty-two miles  the snark had not
abated her six-knot gait and she had not struck futuna yet  at
half-past five i was again on deck  wada at the wheel had seen no

an ancient sudanese proverb says "salt comes from the north gold from
the south and silver from the country of the white men but the word of
god and the treasures of wisdom are only to be found in timbuctoo" it
would be an exaggeration to put the university in the mosque of sankoré
on a level with those of egypt morocco or syria but it was the great
intellectual nucleus of the sudan and also one of the great scientific
centres of islam itself her collection of ancient manuscripts leaves us
in no doubt upon the point there is an entire class of the population
devoted to the study of letters they are called marabuts or sheikhs
and from them doctors priests schoolmasters and jurists are drawn

the prosperity of the french sudan is so closely connected with that of
its principal market that if the general anarchy had been prolonged in
timbuctoo all the sacrifices of human life and money france had made on
her threshold would have remained sterile the french government decided
that the sooner an end was put to the ruinous dominion of the touaregs
the better it would be up to the last moment england endeavoured to put
her hand upon the commerce of timbuctoo failing in her efforts from
tripoli and the niger's mouth she attempted to secure a footing by way
of morocco and was installed towards 1890 at cape juby it was then too
late french columns and posts had been slowly advanced by the senegal
route and in 1893 jenne was captured

in the following year a flotilla of gunboats was dispatched while two
columns of troops followed up to anticipate any concentration of nomad
touaregs which might prevent the occupation of the mysterious city
from the flotilla a detachment of nineteen men was landed of these only
seven were europeans the remainder being senegalese negroes they had
two machine guns with them and under the command of a naval
lieutenant boiteux by name they marched to the walls of timbuctoo and
demanded that the rulers of the city should surrender it and that they
should sign a treaty of peace placing the country under the protectorate
of france the city was occupied temporary fortlets were run up and
the nineteen mariners held them till january 10 1894 when the first of
the two of the french columns entered the town twenty-five days later
the second column arrived

the french occupation of timbuctoo the mysterious was complete and cape
juby was evacuated by england two large forts have now replaced the
improvised fortifications and their guns command every side of the
town under their protection the inhabitants are reviving the long
nightmare of the touaregs is being slowly dispelled houses are being
repaired and rebuilt the occupants leave their doors ajar and resume
their beautifully embroidered robes and one can picture the city
becoming a centre of european civilisation and science as it was
formerly of mussulman culture



i do remember that being a youth and one of her majestie's scholars at
westminster that fruitfull nurserie it was my happe to visit the
chamber of master richard hakluyt my cousin a gentleman of the middle
temple at a time when i found lying open upon his borde certeine bookes
of cosmographie with an universall mappe he seeing me somewhat curious
in the view thereof began to instruct my ignorance by showing me the
division of the earth into three parts after the old account and then
according to the latter and better distribution into more he pointed
out with his wand to all the known seas gulfs bayes streights capes
rivers empires kingdoms dukedoms and territories of each part with
declaration also of their speciall commodities and particular wants
which by the benefit of traffike and intercourse of merchants are
plentifully supplied

from the mappe he brought me to the bible and turning to the 107th
psalme directed me to the 23rd and 24th verses where i read that "they
which go downe to the sea in ships and occupy by the great waters they
see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deepe" etc

which words of the prophet together with my cousin's discourse (things
of high and rare delight to my young nature) tooke in me so deepe an
impression that i constantly resolved if ever i were preferred to the
university where better time and more convenient place might be
ministered for these studies i would by god's assistance prosecute
that knowledge and kinde of literature the doores whereof were so
happily opened before me

according to which my resolution when not long after i was removed to
christ church in oxford my exercises of duty first performed i fell to
my intended course and by degrees read over whatsoever printed or
written discoveries and voyages i found extant either in the greeke
latine italian spanish portugall french or english languages in
continuance of time i grew familiarly acquainted with the chiefest
captaines at sea the gretest merchants and the best mariners of our
nation by which means having gotten somewhat more than common
knowledge

i passed at length the narrow seas into france there i both heard in
speech and read in books other nations miraculously extolled for their
discoveries and notable enterprises by sea but the english of all
others for their sluggish security and continuall neglect of the like
attempts either ignominiously reported or exceedingly condemned thus
both hearing and reading the obluquie of our nation and finding few or
none of our owne men able to replie heerin and further not seeing any
man to have care to recommend to the world the industrious labors and
painefull travels of our countrymen myselfe returned from france
determined to undertake the burden of that worke wherein all others
pretended either ignorance or lacke of leasure whereas the huge toile
and the small profit to insue were the chiefe causes of the refusall

i calle the worke a burden in consideration that these voyages lay so
dispersed and hidden in severall hucksters' hands that i now wonder at
myselfe to see how i was able to endure the delays curiosity and
backwardnesse of many from whom i was to receive my originals and thus
friendly reader thou seest the briefe summe and scope of my labours for
the commonwealth's sake and thy sake bestowed upon this work which
may i pray bring thee no little profit


ii the victories of king arthur in foreign lands

arthur which was sometimes the most renowned king of the britaines was
a mightie and valiant man and a famous warriour this kingdome was too
little for him and his minde was not contented with it he therefore
valiantly subdued all scantia which is now called norway and islands
beyond norway to wit island and greenland sweueland ireland
gotland denmarke and all the other lands and islands of the east sea
even into russia and many others islands beyond norway even under the
north pole which are appendances of scantia now called norway these
people were wild and savage and held not in them the love of god nor of
their neighbours because all evill cometh from the north yet there
were among them certeine christians living in secret but king arthur
was an exceeding good christian and caused them to be baptised and
thorowout all norway to worship one god and to receive and keepe
inviolably for ever faith in christ onely

at that time all the noble men of norway tooke wives of the noble
nation of the britaines whereupon the norses say that they are
descended of the race and blood of this kingdome the aforesaid king
arthur obteined also in those days of the pope and court of rome that
norway should be for ever annexed to the crown of britaine for the
inlargement of this kingdome and he called it the chamber of britaine
for this cause the norses say that they ought to dwell with us in this
kingdome to wit that they belong to the crowne of britaine for they
had rather dwell here than in their owne native countrey which is drie
and full of mountaines and barren and no graine growing there but in
certain places but this countrey of britaine is fruitfull wherein
corne and all other good things do grow and increase for which cause
many cruell battles have been often-times fought betwixt the englishmen
and the people of norway and infinite numbers of people have been
slaine and the norses have possessed many lands and islands of this
empire which unto this day they doe possess neither could they ever
afterwards be fully expelled


iii how martin frobisher sought a passage to cathaya by the
north-west

it appeareth that not onely the middle zone but also the zones about the
poles are habitable which thing being well considered and familiarly
knowen to our generall captaine frobisher as well for that he is
thorowly furnished of the knowledge of the sphere and all other skilles
appertaining to the arte of navigation as also for the confirmation he
hath of the same by many yeares experience both by sea and land and
being persuaded of a new and nerer passage to cathaya than by capo di
buona sperança he began first with himself to devise and then with his
friends to conferre and declared unto them that that voyage was not
onely possible by the north-west but he could prove easie to be
performed

and further he determined and resolved with himselfe to go make full
proofe thereof and to accomplish or bring true certificate of the
truth or else never to return againe knowing this to be the onely
thing of the world that was left yet undone whereby a notable minde
might be made famous and fortunate but although his will were great to
performe this notable voyage yet he wanted altogether meanes and
ability to set forward and performe the same he layed open to many
great estates and learned men the plot and summe of his device and so
by litle and litle with no small expense and paine he brought his
cause to some perfection and had drawen together so many adventurers
and such summes of money as might well defray a reasonable charge to
furnish himselfe to sea withall

he prepared two small barks of twenty and five and twenty tunne apiece
wherein he intended to accomplish his pretended voyage wherefore being
furnished with the aforesayd two barks and one small pinnesse of ten
tun burthen having therein victuals and other necessaries for twelve
months provision he departed upon the sayd voyage from blacke-wall the
fifteenth of june anno domini 1576 one of the barks wherein he went
was named the gabriel and the other the michael and sailing northwest
from england upon the eleventh of july he had sight of an high and
ragged land which he judged to be frisland but durst not approch the
same by reason of the great store of ice that lay alongst the coast
and the great mists that troubled them not a litle not farre from
thence he lost company of his small pinnesse which by meanes of a great
storme he supposed to be swallowed up of the sea wherein he lost onely
foure men also the other barke named the michael mistrusting the
matter conveyed themselves privily away from him and returned home
with great report that he was cast away

the worthy captaine notwithstanding these discomforts although his
mast was sprung and his toppe mast blowen overboord with extreame foul
weather continued his course towards the north-west knowing that the
sea at length must needs have an ending and that some land should have
a beginning that way and determined therefore at the least to bring
true proofe what land and sea the same might be so farre to the
north-westwards beyond any man that had heretofore discovered and the
twentieth of july he had sight of an high land which he called queen
elizabeth's forland after her majestie's name and sailing more
northerly alongst that coast he descried another forland with a great
gut baye or passage divided as it were two maine lands or continents
asunder

he determined to make proofe of this place to see how farre that gut
had continuance and whether he might carry himself thorow the same into
some open sea on the backe side whereof he conceived no small hope and
so entered the same the one and twentieth of july and passed above
fifty leagues therein as he reported having upon either hand a great
maine or continent and that land upon his right hand as he sailed
westward he judged to be the continent of asia and there to be divided
from the firme of america which lieth upon the left hand over against
the same this place he named after his name frobisher's streights

after our captaine martin frobisher had passed sixty leagues into this
foresayed streight he went ashore and found signes where fire had bene
made

he saw mighty deere that seemed to be mankinde which ranne at him and
hardly he escaped with his life in a narrow way where he was faine to
use defence and policy to save his life in this place he saw and
perceived sundry tokens of the peoples resorting thither and being
ashore upon the top of a hill he perceived a number of small things
fleeting in the sea afarre off which he supposed to be porposes or
seales or some kinde of strange fish but coming neerer he
discovered them to be men in small boats made of leather and before
he could descend downe from the hill certeine of those people had
almost cut off his boat from him having stolen secretly behinde the
rocks for that purpose when he speedily hasted to his boat and bent
himselfe to his halberd and narrowly escaped the danger and saved his
boat

afterwards he had sundry conferences with them and they came aboord
his ship and brought him salmon and raw flesh and fish and greedily
devoured the same before our men's faces

after great courtesie and many meetings our mariners contrary to
their captaine's direction began more easily to trust them and five of
our men going ashore were by them intercepted with their boat and
were never since heard of to this day againe so that the captaine
being destitute of boat barke and all company had scarsely sufficient
number to conduct back his barke againe he could not now convey
himselfe ashore to rescue his men if he had been able for want of a
boat and againe the subtile traitours were so wary as they would after
that never come within our men's danger

the captaine notwithstanding desirous to bring some token from thence
of his being there was greatly discontented that he had not before
apprehended some of them and therefore to deceive the deceivers he
wrought a prety policy for knowing wel how they greatly delited in our
toyes and specially in belles he rang a pretty lowbel making signes
that he would give him the same that would come and fetch it and to
make them more greedy of the matter he rang a louder bel so that in the
end one of them came nere the ship side to receive the bel which when
he thought to take at the captaine's hand he was thereby taken himselfe
for the captaine being readily provided let the bel fall and caught
the man fast and plucked him with main force boat and all into his
barke out of the sea whereupon when he found himself in captivity
for very choler and disdaine he bit his tongue in twain within his
mouth notwithstanding he died not thereof but lived until he came in
england and then he died of cold

nor with this new pray (which was a sufficient witnesse of the
captaine's farre and tedious travell towards the unknowen parts of the
world as did well appeare by this strange infidell whose like was
never seene read nor heard of before and whose language was neither
knowen nor understood of any) the sayd captaine frobisher returned
homeward and arrived in england in harwich the second of october
following and thence came to london 1576 where he was highly
commended by all men for his notable attempt but specially for the
great hope he brought of the passage to cathaya


iv the valiant fight of the content against some spanish ships

three ships of sir george carey made a notable fight against certaine
spanish galleys in the west indies and this is the relation of it

the 13th of june 1591 being sunday at five of the clock in the
morning we descried six saile of the king of spain his ships we met
with them off the cape de corrientes which standeth on the island of
cuba the sight of the foresayd ships made us joyfull hoping that they
should make our voyage but as soon as they descryed us they made false
fires one to another and gathered their fleet together we therefore
at six of the clock in the morning having made our prayers to almighty
god prepared ourselves for the fight we in the content bare up with
their vice-admiral and (ranging along by his broadside aweather of him)
gave him a volley of muskets and our great ordinance then coming up
with another small ship ahead of the former we hailed her in such sort
that she payd roome
