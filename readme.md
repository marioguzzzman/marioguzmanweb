# Mario Guzman
Mexican researcher, experimental writer and new media artist merging language with audiovisual phenomena, web development, electronic art, algorithmic literature, and robotics.
In my work, I explore the communication between human and non-human agents, robot-human interaction, and different methods to encode perception and narrative through technology.
I want to bring code, storytelling, and culture together. From my perspective, writing is a performative process that creates meaningful scenarios in which humans and machines participate together in the creation and negotiation of meaning as an interactive experience.

Topics of research: Electronic literature, web development, live performance, interactive media, code studies, generative design, Natural Language Processing, robotics, machine learning.
